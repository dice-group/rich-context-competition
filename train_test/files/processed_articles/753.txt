Kasl2\n'Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research, Rutgers University,\ndepartment of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale School of Medicine.\nWhat is the relationship between religious involvement and functional disability among elderly people? Is being dis-\nabled different for those who frequently attend religious services? Does religious involvement have an effect on sub-\nsequent change in disability? Deriving our hypotheses from traditional theories in the sociology of religion, these\nquestions are explored in these two related articles. Both employ data from the New Haven site of the Established\nPopulationsfor the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (N = 2812). In the first, cross-sectional correlates of religious\ninvolvement and disability are examined at the baseline of the study, including multiple indicators of health practices,\nsocial activities, and subjective well-being. We test for interactions between religious attendance and disability.\nFindings are (a) that religious involvement in 1982 is tied to a broad array of behavioral and psychosocial resources,\n(b) that these resources are associated primarily with attendance at services, and not with subjective feelings of reli-\ngiousness, and (c) that some of these associations are especially pronounced among disabled respondents.\nHOW is religious involvement related to the health and\nfunctioning of elderly persons? Long theoretical tradi-\ntions in the sociology and psychology of religion link reli-\ngious beliefs and practices to higher levels of health and\nnumber of recent studies also conclude that religious prac-\ntices are associated with better mental and physical health\ntheoretical reasons for expecting religion to be related to\nbetter health: religious beliefs often foster good health\npractices and minimize poor ones such as alcohol and sub-\nstance abuse; religious communities provide cohesive so-\ncial network contacts and support for people with large and\nsmall life problems; and religion offers a coherent, overar-\nching set of beliefs for interpreting the events of life and\ndeath (Idler, 1994). Given these broad domains, it is hard to\nimagine any aspect of human health research, from preven-\ntive practices to the care of the dying, among elderly per-\nsons or any other group, to which religion is not potentially\nrelevant.\nThe sociology of religion, going back to its origins, sup-\nplies us with an overarching theoretical framework that\nplaces all of these reasons in a coherent structure. Religions\ntend to promote healthy life styles as part of their overall\nregulative function; Durkheim's study of suicide rates\nshowed that religious groups provide rules for many areas\nof life, and that these rules have a preservative function for\nactually a very clear one; practices which are proscribed,\nsuch as drinking to excess, smoking, or having multiple sex-\nual partners, are self-indulgent, individualistic behaviors\nthat groups have an interest in constraining. Religious\ngroups have an integrative function, as well. They provide\nmembers with a sense of belonging and a source of tangible\nsupport that Durkheim found was also related to lower rates\nof suicide. Finally, religious groups offer members an elabo-\nrated system of beliefs, about God and human relationships,\nmany of which are extremely relevant to health. Max Weber\ndescribes religious revelation as providing \"coherent mean-\nQuestions about meaning and purpose in one's life tend to\nbe brought to the foreground in crises, especially that of se-\nrious illness, and also as part of normal developmental\naging processes at the end of life (Erikson, Erikson, and\nKivnick, 1986). Religious belief systems provide \"symbolic\nuniverses\" (Berger, 1967) in which these events gain spiri-\ntual significance, placing the individual's life in a much\nlarger context, of membership in a continuing community of\nbelievers, or an afterlife. Thus, there are many reasons for\nthinking that religion should be beneficial for individual\nhealth; we do not consider this list exhaustive, but only il-\nlustrative of the complexity of religious involvement.\nMoreover, religion is of particular importance to elderly\nAmericans; nationally, 52 percent of those 65 and over at-\ntend religious services once a week or more, by far the\nhighest of any age group (Princeton Religion Research\nCenter, 1994). A recent National Institute on Aging (NIA)\nconference highlighted the existing state of knowledge\nabout aging, health, and religion, and concluded that, while\nreligiousness and religious affiliation are generally found to\nbe positively related to health and well-being, methodologi-\ncal limitations plague much of the work that has been done\nto date, and the relationship is poorly understood (NIA,\n1995). Biases identified in existing studies included small\nconvenience samples, unknown reliability and validity of\nmeasures of religiousness, selective attrition, and the non-\ngeneralizability of regional or demographically narrow\nsamples. The conference concluded that religious activities\nand beliefs were important to large segments of the elderly\npopulation and that more studies of this complex social and\npsychological phenomenon were warranted.\nOther recent reviews of the literature in this area have\nalso called for improvements in study design and measure-\nEmpirical support for a causal relationship in an epidemio-\nlogical study would optimally have a prospective study de-\nsign that employs a representative sample that is socially\narid religiously heterogeneous, collects data that represent\nthe multiple dimensions of religious beliefs, practices, and\nsubjective feelings, and assesses health status comprehen-\nsively. Moreover, an attempt to identify the mechanisms un-\nderlying such a relationship would necessitate the availabil-\nity of additional data on health practices, social ties, and/or\nsubjective well-being.\nIn these two articles we ask a series of questions about\nthe relationship between religious involvement, disability,\nand other aspects of the lives of elderly people both cross-\nsectionally and longitudinally. Do the lives of elderly peo-\nple who attend religious services (or who are privately de-\nvout) differ from the lives of those who do not, in other\nways besides the specifically religious domain? Does atten-\ndance at religious services or do subjective feelings of reli-\ngiousness form a pattern with better health practices, or\nmore close social relations, or a higher level of well-being?\nAnd in any of these areas, is there a particular importance\nof religious involvement for disabled elderly persons? In\nthe second article (Idler and Kasl, 1997) we ask about both\nthe longitudinal impact of religion on disability and the im-\npact of disability on religion, extending previously pub-\nlished short-term findings on the former (Idler and Kasl,\nproject. We then look to see if effects of religious atten-\ndance and subjective religiousness on disability are\nexplained in any way by differential patterns in health\npractices, social contacts, or well-being. Our theoretical\nframework links religion to better health conceptually, and\nsimultaneously suggests ways in which religion may have\nboth direct and indirect effects on health.\nWe begin by examining the characteristics of elderly per-\nsons in New Haven, Connecticut, who attend services fre-\nquently and who describe themselves as highly religious\npeople. At the cross-sectional level, we expect to see\nhealthier members of the sample attending services more\noften, either because past attendance has already benefited\nthem, or because of selection effects preventing the\nalready-disabled from participating. Thus there are, in ef-\nfect, two strong reasons for expecting the same direction of\nassociation. With subjective religiousness the case is much\nless clear. Because people often turn to religion in times of\ncrisis, particularly health crises, for solace and comfort, the\nrelationship between subjective religiousness and health is\npotentially v*ery complex (Idler, 1995). Religious feelings\nare not subject to the same kinds of selection effects as at-\ntendance; no physical effort or ability is required for experi-\nencing them. At the cross-sectional level, then, we might\nexpect to find higher feelings of subjective religiousness\nprecisely among people in poor health.\nHypothesis 1: Cross-sectionally, better health status and\nfunctioning will be associated with higher levels of atten-\ndance at services.\nHypothesis 2: Cross-sectionally, poorer health status and\nfunctioning will be associated with higher levels of subjec-\ntive religiousness, or there will be no association between\nthe two.\nWe then examine the behavioral and psychosocial corre-\nlates of religious involvement, controlling for health condi-\ntions and disability at the baseline of the study. Because\nDurkheimian regulation implicit in religious involvement\nmay promote a \"healthier\" life style with respect to tradi-\ntional risk factors, we examine the cross-sectional associa-\ntions between religious involvement (attendance and sub-\njective religiousness) and smoking, alcohol use, obesity,\nand physical exercise. The negative association between\nreligiousness and lower levels of alcohol use is relatively\nwell-documented, both cross-sectionally and longitudi-\nnally (studies reviewed in Gorsuch, 1995), despite differ-\ning religious norms regarding drinking and the almost total\nabsence of theory in this area. Few studies have examined\nsmoking and religiousness; one report found lower con-\nsumption of tobacco among the more religious in a sample\nof elderly geriatric patients (Koenig, Moberg, and Kvale,\n1988). With relatively little empirical research to guide us,\nwe take the Durkheimian point of view (see also\nMechanic, 1990) that attendance at religious services is ev-\nidence, among other things, of the observance of social\nnorms in general, and therefore hypothesize that there will\nbe a beneficial effect of religious involvement of any type\non health practices.\nHypothesis 3: High levels of religious involvement, both at-\ntendance and subjective feelings, will be associated with\nfewer poor health practices of smoking, high alcohol use,\noverweight, and lack ofphysical activity.\nDurkheim's work in Suicide also showed that religious\ngroups provide social support and integration, in addition to\nconstraining individuals by regulating their behavior.\nEmpirically there are just a few studies that look at the pos-\nitive cross-sectional association between membership in re-\nligious groups and other types of social ties. In a North\nCarolina study, frequent attenders at religious services had\nlarger social networks, more contacts with them, more so-\ncial support from them, and more feelings of being valued\nand cared for than infrequent attenders or nonattenders\n(Ellison and George, 1994). These findings were recently\nreplicated on a national sample (Bradley, 1995). In the\nNorth Carolina study, attendance at services was associated\nwith more extensive non-kin networks, as one might have\nexpected, rather than additional family contacts. We hy-\npothesize that higher levels of religious involvement will be\nassociated with more leisure social activities, and larger and\ncloser social networks (especially of non-kin).\nHypothesis 4: High levels of religious involvement (atten-\ndance and subjective feelings) will be associated with\nlarger and closer social networks, and greater numbers of\nleisure activities.\nThese higher levels of social connections fostered by re-\nligious involvement should then promote higher levels of\nwell-being. In addition to the Durkheimian functions of re-\nligious groups, the Weberian strand in the sociology of reli-\ngion directs our attention to understanding human action at\nthe level of meaning. A more cognitively based line of rea-\nsoning might be that religion offers a framework for inter-\npreting the joys and losses in life that is especially helpful\nin old age. Religion, as a system of symbols, provides re-\nsources for helping individuals to find meaning in all the\nevents of life, meanings that are socially shared, and which\nlink human affairs to the transcendent. William James ob-\nserved long ago that religion is associated with the positive\nKoenig (Koenig, Smiley, and Gdhzales, 1988) writes, \"The\nJudeo-Christian scriptures are full of references to the\npower of the thought life in affecting both emotional and\nspiritual states... [they] encourage positive thinking... and\noften direct thoughts toward helping others in worse situa-\ntions\" (p. 36). Reviews of the literature show a strong asso-\nciation of religion with better mental health (Koenig, 1995;\nLevin, 1994). The very small amount of empirical research\nthat exists on the relationship between religion and opti-\nmism also shows that turning to religion is associated with\nthe generalized expectation that outcomes will be positive\n(Carver, Scheier, and Weintraub, 1989; Scheier and Carver,\n1987). Another indicator of subjective well-being is the re-\nspondent's self-ratings of health, which may also be en-\nhanced by religious participation, if it directs attention\naway from the physical and toward the spiritual realm\nHypothesis 5: Religious involvement will be positively asso-\nciated with optimism and better self-ratings of health, and\nnegatively associated with depression.\nStudies of religious coping, of people in adverse situa-\ntions seeking comfort and understanding in religion, are be-\ncoming more frequent (Ellison, 1994; Mclntosh, Silver, and\nCohen, 1993). One study of elderly hospitalized veterans\nfound that religious coping was the sole predictor of lower\ndepression scores at a 6-month follow-up (Koenig et al.,\n1992); others have shown that religion is especially effec-\ntive in coping with situations of loss or illness (Mattlin,\nWethington, and Kessler, 1990; Moen, Robison, and\nWhile we do not have direct measures of coping available\nin this study, we can approach this topic by looking for dif-\nferential effects of religious involvement among the dis-\nabled, or interaction effects. While we expect to see no dif-\nferences with respect to health practices, we hypothesize\nthat religious involvement of either type will have special\npsychosocial benefits for the disabled. Two earlier analyses\nlower levels of depression among the religiously involved\ndisabled compared with the nonreligious disabled; we ex-\npect that these differential associations will extend to social\ncontacts with kin and friends, and our multiple measures of\nwell-being, which include optimism, several subcategories\nof depression, and self-ratings of health.\nHypothesis 6: There will be stronger effects of religious in-\nvolvement on social activities and well-being among the\ndisabled than among the nondisabled (interaction effect).\nreligion have frequently documented the differing benefits\nof religious group membership by denomination (Ellison,\nvolvement is also known to be greater on average among\nelderly African Americans than among elderly Whites\n1991). Age differences might also be important, as the pro-\ncess of aging changes both the amount (Blazer and Pal-\nThus, we include religious affiliation, age, race, and gender\nas covariates in all cross-sectional analyses.\nMETHOD\nSample\nData are from the New Haven site of the Established\nPopulations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly\n(EPESE) project of the National Institute on Aging (Cornoni-\nHuntley et al., 1986). Noninstitutionalized, community-\ndwelling elderly persons (N = 2812) in the city of New\nand again in 1994, some years in person, some by telephone.\nThe stratified probability sample was drawn from public\nhousing, privately financed housing for elderly people, and\ncommunity neighborhoods. Males and residents of public\nand private housing were oversampled. The 1982 response\nrate was 82 percent; annual follow-up response rates aver-\naged 96 percent for survivors.\nMeasures\nReligion. -- There are two measures of religious involve-\nment and one of affiliation. Respondents were asked if they\nwere Protestant, Roman Catholic, Jewish, other, or had no\nreligious preference. Because of small numbers we com-\nbined the other and no preference categories. Also, because\nthe Protestant group was known to be divided among\nBlacks and Whites with very different socioeconomic and\nreligious practice characteristics, we divided this group by\nrace. These categories yield us a set of four dummy vari-\nables with \"Roman Catholic\" the reference category.\nFrequency of attendance at services is measured by a sin-\ngle item with six categories ranging from \"more than once\na week\" to \"never\"; 40 percent of the sample attend ser-\nvices once a week or more. Subjective religious involve-\nment is composed of how deeply religious a person feels (4\ncategories), and how much strength and comfort they re-\nceive from religion (3 categories); 37 percent of the sample\nfeel \"deeply\" religious and 71 percent report receiving \"a\ngreat deal\" of strength and comfort from religion. Religious\nattendance and subjective religiousness are moderately as-\nsociated with each other; the 1982 measures have a Pearson\nr of .36. We recognize that these three indicators of reli-\ngious involvement are not ideal; there are too few to be\nconsidered optimal from a measurement point of view, and\nsome important dimensions (private devotional practices)\nare omitted altogether. However, these are the data avail-\nable from this project, which was not designed for research\non religion. We would note that (a) the single religious at-\ntendance item makes our study comparable with most of\nthe other research in the field; (b) the 1982 two-item sub-\njective religiousness measure has a Cronbach's alpha of\n.70; and (c) both the attendance and subjective religious-\nness measures show temporal stability, with Pearson rs of\nFunctional ability. -- This variable is composed of 15\nitems asked at baseline in 1982 and at every annual follow-\nup. For the present analysis, a new scale was constructed to\nimprove the sensitivity of an earlier scale (which was de-\nscribed in Berkman et al., 1986), especially to variation\nwithin the \"severe\" disability category. Because the 15\nitems came from three different sources, and contained dif-\nferent numbers of response categories, a simple sum of\nitems was not possible. We also wanted to retain all the de-\ntail of the responses (for example, differentiating \"has some\ndifficulty\" from \"unable to do\"). Thus, we gave each item a\nmaximum score of 10 and a minimum score of 0, and ap-\nportioned to intervening categories accordingly (0 = Needs\nno help, 5 = Needs help from person or equipment, 10 =\nNot able to do [from Rosow and Breslau, 1966]; 0 = No\ndifficulty, 2.5 = A little difficulty, 5 = Some difficulty, 7.5 =\nA lot of difficulty, 10 = Unable to do [from Nagi, 1976]). A\nrespondent's mean score for nonmissing items was at-\ntributed to items for two or fewer missing items. This re-\nduced the amount of missing data for 1982 scores to just\nmean score was just under 19 (see Table 1). Cronbach's\nHealth status. -- Covariates for 1982 health status were\na part of all analyses. Data were available on diagnosed\nchronic conditions; symptoms that might indicate serious,\nbut undiagnosed, conditions; measured blood pressure; and\ninterviewer-observed prescription medications. We at-\ntempted to use all of the health status information available\nin the data, including indicators of recency, severity, site,\nand medications, as follow-up questions to a number of the\nchronic condition items. Table 1 shows the coding direction\nand means of all variables we considered. The variables\nStroke, Diabetes, and Amputation, which have three cate-\ngories in the table, are treated as separate contrasts in the\nanalysis (with \"condition absent\" as the reference cate-\ngory). Health status variables that were not significantly as-\nsociated with the dependent variable in 1982 or in any of\nthe years of follow-up were dropped from the analysis.\nDemographics. -- Table 1 shows univariate statistics for\ndemographic characteristics, including sex, age, race\n(White, non-White), education, perceived low income, and\nmarital status. The sample is 42 percent male and 21 per-\ncent non-White; 37 percent are married and 9 percent feel\ntheir income is inadequate for their needs. The average age\nof respondents is 74.5 years and they have had an average\nof 9 years of education.\nHealth practices. -- Table 1 also shows univariate statis-\ntics for the health practices we considered. Fifty percent of\nthe sample has never smoked, 20 percent currently smoke,\nand 30 percent have quit. The physical activities index in-\ncludes gardening, exercise, sports, and walking, scored as\nnever, sometimes, or always, and summed; over 90 percent\nof the sample score below the theoretical midpoint of the\nscale. For a measure of overweight, we used a continuous\nmeasure of body mass index (BMI) values (calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by height in meters, squared);\nmen with a BMI of 27.8 or more, and women with a BMI of\n27.3 meet the conventional criteria for obesity, approxi-\nmately 120 percent of desirable weight (Kuczmarski et al.,\n1994). With these criteria, 26 percent of our sample are clas-\nsified as obese, a lower proportion for this age group than in\na nationally representative sample (National Center for\nHealth Statistics, 1995). Our alcohol use index multiplies\nthe amount (number of usual drinks) by the frequency (num-\nber of times drinking per week), and weights by the alcohol\ncontent for beer, wine, or liquor consumed; 51 percent of the\nsample do not drink at all, and 80 percent have scores below\nthe mean, reflecting the skewed distribution of the scores.\nSocial activities. -- The social activities index, scored in\nthe same way as the physical activities index, includes\ngoing to movies, sports events, shopping, watching TV,\npreparing meals, reading, traveling, doing community or\nvolunteer work, playing cards or bingo, and doing puzzles\nor hobbies. The scores here are much higher than they were\nfor physical activities; most respondents score in the theo-\nretical midrange of the scale. The number of social contacts\nwas reported separately as family (children, siblings, rela-\ntives) seen at least once a month, and friends seen at least\nonce a month. Scores represent actual numbers of persons\nmentioned. Twenty-two percent reported seeing no friends\nregularly, and almost 17 percent reported seeing no family.\nThe number of close relationships was also reported as\nfamily members the respondent felt close to, and close\nfriends. Twenty-two percent also reported no close friends,\nbut only 5.5 percent reported no kin they felt close to. An\nadditional measure of social ties was provided by asking\nthe respondent with whom they had celebrated the last win-\nter holidays (Christmas, Hannukah, or New Year's). Scores\non this variable reflect the number of groups (spouse, chil-\ndren, siblings, relatives, friends, neighbors, etc.) mentioned,\nnot the number of persons. Only 9 percent of the sample\nsaid they had celebrated the holidays with no one.\nWell-being. -- Psychological characteristics of self-rated\nhealth, depression symptoms, and optimism were also exam-\nined. Self-rated health was the single-item measure scored as\nexcellent, good, fair, poor, or bad. Fifty-eight percent of the\nsample reported that their health was good or excellent. The\nmeasure of depression symptoms used was the CES-D scale\n(Radloff, 1977), and in addition we broke it down into its\nTable 1.

Cronbach's alpha for the 20-item scale is .86.\nEighty-four percent of the sample scores below the conven-\ntional cutpoint of 16. The subscales include positive affect\n(feeling as good as other people, feeling hopeful about the\nfuture, being happy, and enjoying life) (alpha = .65); negative\naffect (having the blues, feeling depressed, feeling lonely,\ncrying, and feeling sad) (alpha = .81); somatic distress (loss\nof appetite, everything is an effort, can't get going) (alpha =\n.59); and interpersonal problems (people are unfriendly, peo-\nple dislike me) (alpha = .57). The measure of optimism was a\nsum of two items, having faith that things will turn out all\nright, and feeling a part of things (alpha = .56); 54 percent of\nthe sample scored the maximum. Clearly, several of these al-\nphas are only marginally acceptable. We include the CES-D\nsubscales for illustrative purposes, but rely on the psychome-\ntrically sound full CES-D score for the later longitudinal\nanalyses. The measure of optimism is not what one would\nwish, but it is so potentially important in understanding the\neffect of religion that we use it anyway.\nAnalysis. -- Univariate and bivariate analyses are un-\nweighted. All multivariate regression analyses were per-\nformed with SUDAAN to adjust for the complex, stratified,\nand clustered nature of the study design. This procedure ad-\njusts standard errors by weighting for the different sampling\nfractions and nonresponse; it frequently produces larger\nstandard errors and therefore more stringent tests of signifi-\ncance (Shah et al., 1992). Most models have interval-level or\ncontinuous dependent variables, to which least-squares esti-\nmates for linear regression are fitted. One dichotomous vari-\nable, smoking, required maximum likelihood techniques for\nlogistic regression. We used the much simpler binomial, in-\nstead of the trinomial, logistic regression for smoking be-\ncause a cross-tabulation of smoking status by attendance at\nservices showed that past smokers had patterns of atten-\ndance that were nearly identical to present smokers, and that\nboth were significantly different from those who had never\nsmoked. In the second, longitudinal phase of this study, we\nretain the three categories of smoking for use as independent\nvariables.\nFirst, we looked at bivariate associations between disabil-\nity and the three religion measures. Then we regressed atten-\ndance and subjective religiousness on the full set of disabil-\nity, health status, and sociodemographic factors. Next, we\nregressed each of the health behavior, social network, and\nsubjective well-being characteristics on religious involve-\nment, disability, the set of health status covariates, and the\ndemographic factors. Because we were particularly inter-\nested in disabled elderly persons, we tested interaction terms\nfor disability by religiousness. Where it was appropriate, we\nstratified the sample by disability level to clarify the inter-\npretation of the interaction. All coefficients reported in\nTables 2 to 4 are unstandardized; they can be interpreted di-\nrectly as units of change in the dependent variable at-\ntributable to one unit of change in the independent variable.\nRESULTS\nInitial bivariate analysis of disability and the three reli-\ngion measures (affiliation, attendance, and subjective) was\nundertaken with cross-tabulations (not shown). Disability\nscores were trichotomized into three roughly equal-sized\ngroups, those with no disability at all (score = 0, n = 924),\nthose with mild to moderate disability (score = 1-21, n =\n950), and those with severe disability (score = 22+, n =\n907). These tables showed that Black Protestants were\nmore likely than expected to fall into the most disabled cat-\negory, and that Roman Catholics were correspondingly less\nthis is an effect of race rather than denomination. A second\ntable showed a strong association between disability level\nand attendance, with exactly 50 percent of those with no\ndisability attending weekly or more often, compared with\n44.9 percent of those with mild-to-moderate disability, and\n25.6 percent of those with severe disability. Thirty-seven\npercent of those in the highest category of disability\np < .001). The association between subjective religiousness\nand disability is U-shaped; more than the expected number\nof those with no disability say they are deeply religious, but\nPearson r for attendance and disability is -.26 and for sub-\njective religiousness and disability is .06.\nThe first two columns of Table 2 take the two religion\nmeasures as dependent variables, showing their associa-\ntions with the affiliation groups, disability, health status,\nand sociodemographics. They show us the characteristics of\nattenders and those with strong religious feelings, and also\nprovide a basis for later analyses in which follow-up mea-\nsures of religion are taken as dependent variables. The first\ncolumn shows that, as we would expect, the two religion\nmeasures are strongly correlated with each other, and that,\ncompared with Roman Catholics, Black Protestants are\nmore frequent in attendance, but that White Protestants,\nJews, and the other/none group all attend services signifi-\ncantly less frequently. Hypothesis 1 is supported, as we see\nthat disability has a strong negative relationship to atten-\ndance. Once disability has been taken into account, none of\nthe other health status measures show an association with\nattendance. Men are significantly less likely than women to\nattend services, while those with more education attend\nmore often than those with less. Age, race, income, and\nmarital status show no effects. This model accounts for\nabout 27 percent of the variance in attendance. Column two\ntakes subjective religious feelings as its dependent variable\nwith a similar set of independent variables. In some re-\nspects the results are quite similar; again Roman Catholics,\nBlack Protestants, and women exhibit the highest levels of\nreligiousness, but several other characteristics show the op-\nposite pattern from attendance: disability, the number of\nprescription medications, education, and age all have oppo-\nsite signs from the attendance model, indicating higher lev-\nels of subjective religiousness among those who are older,\nless educated, and in poorer health. Hypothesis 2 is thus\nalso supported by the data.\nTable 2 continues by regressing several indicators of\nhealth practices on sets of independent variables which rep-\nresent religious involvement, health status, and demographic\nfactors. The purpose is to test the hypothesis that religious\ninvolvement will be associated with better health practices.\nAn adequate test requires that we adjust, not only for health\nstatus in these models (to minimize the possibility that se-\nlection of the healthiest respondents could explain the asso-\nciation), but also for demographic factors known to be asso-\nciated with religious involvement, health practices, or both.\nThe last four models in Table 2 show the association of reli-\ngious involvement with physical activity, obesity, alcohol\nuse, and smoking, in multivariate models which include de-\nmographic factors, health status and, most importantly,\nbaseline functional disability. Looking at the first two rows,\nwe see that attendance at services is associated with better\nhealth practices in three of the four models; attendance is\nstrongly associated with higher levels of exercise, less alco-\nhol use, and never smoking. High levels of subjective reli-\ngiousness are associated with never having smoked, but also\nwith having a higher weight-to-height ratio. There are also\nsome differences among the affiliation groups: Protestants\nare not different from Roman Catholics when it comes to\nthese health practices, but Jews are significantly less likely\nto be overweight, to use alcohol frequently, or to have\nsmoked. Those with other or no preference also have better\nhealth practices, including more physical activity and fewer\nsmokers. Health status and sociodemographic variables are\nincluded in the models as covariates only. In sum, while\nthere are between-group differences by religious affiliation,\nand noting the exception of overweight, the important find-\ning of the table is that greater religious involvement, primar-\nily more frequent attendance at religious services, is associ-\nated with better health practices in most of these areas,\nproviding support for Hypothesis 3.\nTable 2. 1982 Correlates of Religious Involvement and Health Practices, New Haven EPESE Data\nIndependent\nVariables\"\nAttendance\nSubjective religiousness\nWhite Protestant\nBlack Protestant\"1\nJewishd\nOther/None\"\nNumber Rx meds\nCongestive heart failure\nCognitive function\nSevere'\nAge\nLow income\nMarried\nEducation\nSex (male)\nIntercept\nMultiple R2\nN\nReligious Involvement\nAttendance6\nSubjective\nReligiousness\"\nPhysical\nHealth Practices\nBody\nMass\nIndex\"\nAlcohol\nUse\"\nNever\nSmoked'\n\"The following health status variables were included in all models but had no significant effects in any: stroke, with or without difficulties; diabetes, with\nor without medication; broken bones; amputation of leg or other limb; angina.\n\"Ordinary least squares regression models with standard errors adjusted for complex sample design, unstandardized coefficients.\n'Logistic regression model with standard errors adjusted for complex sample design.\n\u00b7\"Compared to reference category of Roman Catholic.\n'Compared to reference category Minor or no cognitive impairment.\nTo check on differential associations by level of disabil-\nity, we tested interaction terms for religious attendance by\ndisability in the four models, and found that none were sig-\nnificant. This finding was confirmed by running the models\nseparately for the three disability subgroups.\nTable 3 shows a test of Hypothesis 4, with models for\nleisure activities and social ties. Reading across the columns,\nwe see that higher levels of attendance at services are signifi-\ncantly associated, in every case but one, with more social ac-\ntivity: religious participation is positively associated with\nmore leisure activities, all types of social network ties except\nthe number of close kin, and more numerous holiday cele-\nbrations. Subjective religiousness is associated only with the\nnumber of kin contacts reported. All of these associations are\nin a positive direction. Within the affiliation categories, there\nare a large number of negative signs, indicating that Roman\nCatholics overall have higher levels of social interaction, es-\npecially with kin, than the other groups. The groups show no\ndifferences with respect to friendships, however. Jews report\nmore leisure activities than do Catholics.\nOther general characteristics of Table 3 are that very few\nof the physical health status variables, included primarily as\ncovariates, are associated with anything; in this sample at\nleast, poorer health and higher levels of disability are not\nstrongly associated with diminishing social contacts -- in\nfact, previous history of broken bones and the more serious\ntypes of diabetes are associated with more, not fewer, kin\ncontacts and close friends. Poor cognitive function, on the\nother hand, clearly has a negative effect on activities and\nfriendships, but not on kin contacts. Income is not signifi-\ncantly associated with any of these variables, but race, mar-\nital status, education, and gender are, in frequently conflict-\ning ways. Married people name fewer activities and friends,\nbut more close kin, kin contact, and holiday celebrations.\nHighly educated people have more activities and close\nfriends, but fewer kin contacts, and men have fewer leisure\nactivities, and more friends.\nOverall, however, Hypothesis 4 is supported; attendance\nat religious services is positively associated with all of\nthese social ties (except close kin) and activities, and it is\nthe only characteristic in the table that is uniformly positive\nin its associations; marital status, by contrast, has signifi-\ncant associations, but with both positive and negative signs.\nSubjective religious feelings, on the other hand, are associ-\nated only with the number of kin contacts reported. The\npicture given by these cross-sectional associations is that\npublic religious involvement is part of a broad set of social\nroles and activities. Elderly people who attend services fre-\nquently also have large and active family lives, large and\nactive friendship networks, more holiday parties to attend,\nand more of the other types of leisure activities as well.\nTo test Hypothesis 6, that religious involvement might\nhave enhanced benefits for disabled elderly persons in the\nsample, we introduced an Attendance by Disability interac-\nTable 3. 1982 Health, Religious Involvement, and Social Involvement, New Haven EPESE Data\"\nIndependent Variables\"\nReligious attendance\nSubjective religiousness\nWhite Protestant0\nBlack Protestant0\nOther/None0\nDiabetes\n+ medications'1\nDiabetes onlyd\nBroken bones\nCognitive impairment\nAge\nLow income\nMarried\nEducation\nSex (male)\nIntercept\nMultiple R2\nN\nLeisure\nActivities\nNumber\nClose Kin\nNumber\nClose\nFriends\nNumber\nKin\nContacts\nNumber\nFriend\nContacts\nCelebrate\nHolidays\n\"Ordinary least squares regression models with standard errors adjusted for complex sample design, unstandardized coefficients.\nThe following variables were included in all models but had no significant effects in any: stroke, with and without additional difficulties; amputation of\nleg or other limb; number of prescription medications; congestive heart failure; angina.\n'Compared to reference category of Roman Catholic.\ndCompared to reference category of No diabetes.\n'Compared to reference category of Minor or no cognitive impairment.\ntion into each model. The results showed none significant at\nthe p < .05 level. However, there were marginally significant\neffects for the number of friends seen (p = .08) and celebra-\ntion of holidays (p = .08). We followed up by running the\nmodels for these dependent variables separately for the three\ndisability subgroups, and found that in both cases there was a\nvery strong association for the most disabled subgroup, and\nnone at all for the mildly or nondisabled, exactly along the\nlines of Hypothesis 6. In general, Table 3 shows that reli-\ngious attendance is linked to many other forms of social inte-\ngration, not only in spite of disability, but especially where\ndisability is present. Moreover, religious attendance is associ-\nated simultaneously with family and friendship involvement;\nother variables, such as sex, marital status, or education, have\nopposite signs for family and friend ties, suggesting trade-\noffs between them. Religious involvement, on the other hand,\nsupports (or is supported by) kin and non-kin alike.\nTable 4 presents the results of similarly structured regres-\nsion analyses of self-rated health, depression symptoms, and\noptimism on religious involvement, disability, health status,\nand demographic factors. Hypothesis 5 stated that both mea-\nsures of religious involvement would be associated with\nmore positive states of well-being, although we expected\nthat subjective feelings, more than attendance, would be in-\nvolved. However, here, as in the previous tables, it is primar-\nily attendance at services that has the strong associations.\nRespondents who attend services more frequently have sig-\nnificantly fewer total symptoms of depression, including the\ncomponents of positive affect (this scale is coded in reverse\nfor summing with the others), fewer somatic complaints,\nand fewer interpersonal problems. Attendance is marginally\nassociated with optimism, but neither attendance nor subjec-\ntive religiousness is associated with negative affect or self-\nrated health. Black Protestants are significantly different\nfrom Roman Catholics in several respects. They -report\nfewer symptoms of depression, less negative affect, and\nmore optimism, but also more interpersonal problems than\nRoman Catholics; other groups show no differences.\nHealth status measures are more apt to be associated with\nthese measures of subjective well-being than they were with\nthe social structural characteristics. Higher levels of disabil-\nity, more prescription medications, congestive heart failure,\nand cognitive impairment are all associated with more de-\npression symptoms. Women and those with low income also\nshow higher levels of depression symptoms. Disability, pre-\nscription medications, congestive heart failure, and lower\nlevels of education, but not either type of religious involve-\nment, are associated with poorer self-ratings of health. The\nmodel for optimism is more complicated and is only\nmarginally associated with religiousness.

To be\ncertain of the interpretation we reran the models for these\ntwo dependent variables in each of the disability sub-\ngroups. The differences between the groups are quite strik-\ning. In the nondisabled group, there are no significant asso-\nciations of either religion variable with either dependent\nvariable. For positive affect, there is also no association for\nthe mildly disabled group; the entire significant association\nreported as a main effect of religious attendance in Table 4\ncomes from the very strong association between atten-\ndance and positive affect in the severely disabled group (b\ntion (b = .077, p = .049) for the mildly disabled group, but\na much stronger one for the most disabled (b = .150, p -\n.009). These significant interaction effects provide the\nstrongest support in the analysis for Hypothesis 6. Putting\nthe interpretation another way, if one is not disabled, atten-\ndance at religious services is irrelevant to one's feelings of\noptimism and positive affect; however, with some disabil-\nity, and especially with a great deal of disability, the role of\nreligion becomes very important for one's well-being in\nthese two domains.\nDISCUSSION\nWhat is the relationship between religious involvement\nand functional disability? In this study we have looked at\nthe cross-sectional patterns of religious involvement,\nhealth, health practices, social activities, and subjective\nwell-being. We have learned from this analysis that reli-\ngious involvement is tied to a broad array of other resources\nin the lives of the elderly respondents. Our theoretical per-\nspective led us to expect that the religious involvement\nwould be beneficial, and it was. Actually, there were 17 de-\npendent variables in this analysis (not counting the religion\nmeasures themselves); 12 of them had main effect associa-\ntions with attendance at services in the full sample, and 3 of\nthem with subjective religious feelings.\nThus, as Durkheimian and Weberian theory would sug-\ngest, public religious participation is positively associated\nwith other types of social roles and activities as different\nfrom each other as exercising and getting together with\nfamily and friends for holidays. We expected the number of\nfriendship ties and even the closeness of those ties to be en-\nhanced by religious group activities, since religious group\nmembership brings one into wider contact with the commu-\nnity, but family ties and closeness appear to be enhanced as\nwell. Let us underscore that these measures include the\nquality as well as the quantity of role involvements.\nOur findings fit our theoretical framework well. We see\nevidence of the regulation of individual desires for self-\ngratification, the integration of individuals in nurturing,\nsupportive social groups, and the provision of meaning for\nindividuals in old age, all deriving directly from the behav-\nioral indicator of attendance at religious services. The first\nfinding of this study, then, is one of substantial main ef-\nfects: with just a few exceptions, public religious participa-\ntion appears to be part of a broad pattern of positive health\npractices, satisfying social relationships, and psychosocial\nbenefits. The lives of religiously involved elderly persons\nare pervasively different from those of the uninvolved.\nAlthough these were our hypotheses, the strength and con-\nsistency of these associations exceeded our expectations.\nThere are limitations to these findings, of which we are\nkeenly aware. Our measures of religious involvement and\nsome other key concepts such as optimism are not as psy-\nchometrically sound as we would like, and are limited in\nscope. We can only hope that these initial findings will pro-\nvoke more refined investigations fielded with better instru-\nments. Moreover, our study design has been entirely cross-\nsectional, limiting our ability to interpret causal direction.\nWith our findings in Table 2, we cannot say whether the as-\nsociation between better functioning and higher levels of\nattendance is due to selection processes which keep the dis-\nabled from attending, or from pre-baseline causal processes\nthat have already resulted in measurably better functioning\namong regular attenders. We have, however, taken alternate\napproaches to the data, employing the measures of religion\nas both dependent and independent variables, and have\ntried not to oversimplify the complex relationship of reli-\ngiousness and health. Indeed, even with our two very crude\nmeasures we see differences: attendance (in Table 2) is as-\nsociated with less disability, and subjective religiousness is\nassociated with more. Finally, we would point to the\npaucity or almost complete absence of research literature\nfrom representative samples on topics such as religion and\ncigarette smoking, or physical activity, or friendship and\nkin networks. Given the underdeveloped state of research\non religion and health in general, these cross-sectional find-\nings from a diverse, representative sample tell us a good\ndeal about why religion should be related to health. To put\nit simply, there are many reasons, and our research rules out\nnone of the possible mechanisms.\nOur second finding emerges from our focus on disabled\nelderly persons. Our findings of several significant and near-\nsignificant interaction effects showed that the actively reli-\ngious among the disabled received particular benefits in\nterms of additional contacts and closeness with friends, more\nnumerous holiday celebrations, more optimism, and more\npositive affect. These findings underscore, as many other\nstudies have, the special relevance of religion for situations\nof physical illness and disability. Among fully functional el-\nderly persons, friendships, holiday celebrations, optimism,\nand positive affect have distributions which do not depend on\nreligious involvement. This group, with no difficulty in any\nof the 15 areas of functioning, is, however, a minority of the\nsample. The group with some disability is twice as large, and\nhere religious participation carries with it more optimism and\npositive affect, in addition to more friends and celebrations.\nThe full sample models show that disability has strong nega-\ntive effects on social participation; and yet among the vulner-\nable disabled, higher levels of religious participation are\nlinked to lower levels of social isolation and depression.\nA research direction which is suggested by our third\nfinding is a better understanding of the nature of attendance\nat religious services, and how the dynamics differ from the\nrole of what we have called subjective religious involve-\nment. Our findings, that attendance at worship services is\nfar more important than subjective religious involvement,\nput us in the position of swimming against the tide of much\nof the recent literature in studies of religion and aging,\nwhich has directed research interest toward the nonorgani-\nzational and subjective aspects of religious involvement\nsults suggest that, at least from the perspective of health re-\nsearch, a second look at attendance at services might be\nvaluable. The argument is often made that religious in-\nvolvement is multidimensional, that it cannot be captured\nby single items about \"church attendance\" in surveys. It is\napparently thought, if not spoken, that such a single item\nmeasures only the \"social\" or \"belonging\" functions of reli-\ngion. We would argue, on the other hand, that the single in-\ndicator of attendance at services is itself pretty multi-\nfaceted, and that we ought not to take this valuable bit of\ndata so lightly by assuming that we know what it means.\nThere are many dimensions of the human experience of\n\"attendance at services\" that might be useful in understand-\ning its possible beneficial effects on health. There are aes-\nthetic elements in the experience of religious worship, in-\ncluding music, poetry, painting, sculpture, and architecture,\nwhich may assist believers in reaching a transcendent state.\nThere is the opportunity for confession and forgiveness of\nsins, which could be personal and private, or corporate;\nconfession of troubles could relieve stress in many areas of\nlife, and the accompanying forgiveness could reassure the\nindividual of her value and worth. The performance of rit-\nual in the worship service or the manipulation of the tradi-\ntional symbols of the faith, may link the body and the spirit\nin the posture of prayer or the receiving of communion. The\nreading of sacred texts and the interpretation of them retell\nfamiliar stories of human and divine relationships. If these\ndimensions appear to emphasize the psychological experi-\nence of worship, let us emphasize the social context in\nwhich it takes place. It is one thing to listen to religious\nmusic privately in the home and quite another to participate\nby singing with a large group. The religious congregation\nalso offers clearly social opportunities for voluntary giving\nand service, to those in need in the congregation and to oth-\ners at the community, national, and even international level.\nAttendance at religious services in our society builds a\nfoundation for the social support and belonging functions\nfound in any cohesive social group, and undergirds them\nwith the ethical principles of Judeo-Christian beliefs about\nselflessness and concern for others who are less fortunate.\nDurkheim, especially in his late work on religion (1912\n[1995]) emphasized the experience of the inward religious\nlife but never took it far from its social underpinnings.\nWe can summarize the many findings of this first part of\nthe research rather simply, by concluding that the lives of re-\nligious elderly persons are different from those of the nonre-\nligious, in ways which most would interpret as enhance-\nments to their quality of life. Moreover, some of these\ndifferences are especially pronounced for disabled elderly\npersons in the sample, the group that is precisely at risk for\nloss of social opportunities and feelings of well-being.\nKnowing these patterns lays a groundwork for the longitudi-\nnal analysis that is to follow, in which we examine the role\nof religious involvement in the course of disability. We have\nidentified a set of factors which may help explain the poten-\ntial association of religious involvement with functioning.\nKnowing that they are unevenly distributed in the sample is\na contribution in itself, however, which we believe makes a\nbroad contribution to our still rudimentary knowledge of the\nrole of religion in the lives of elderly people.\n"
