The present research concerned adult attachment\nstyle as a potential explanation for ideological divisions. Few studies have examined this, mainly in college student samples, and\ntheir results conflict.

Structural equation\nmodels were estimated for path analyses. The results for the direct effect of secure attachment style on ideology were\nmixed and indicated that both liberals and conservatives can have secure attachments. Results also underscored the potential\nimportance of higher socioeconomic status for secure relational attachment style. Higher religiosity and lower trust in mass\nmedia contributed to conservatism.\n",

The objective of the present research was to study\nideology and attachment in general population samples.\nIdeological divisions have deepened in the United States\nin the past 40 years, making it increasingly difficult for parti-\nsan groups to agree or compromise on policy and legislation\n2012). Well-educated citizens tend to be the most politically\ninvolved and the most likely to identify with an ideological\nAmong other factors contributing to the increasing ideologi-\ncal impasse are intensifying differences among the genera-\ntions (Pew Research Center, 2016) and increasing divides\nbetween the highly religious and the nonreligious (Twenge,\nSherman, Exline, & Grubbs, 2016). Being religious is often\nrelated to being conservative (Brossard, Scheufele, Kim, &\nfactor is citizens'growing preferences for information sources\nassociated with an ideological orientation. Conservatives tend\nto view mainstream news media with distrust and to prefer\noutlets that share their views; liberals are disposed to trust\nnews media, particularly those perceived as congruent with\ntheir positions (Center for Political Communication, 2012;\nThe Current Research\nThe goal was to explore the relationship of attachment and\nideology in the context of variables identified as important to\ntrends shaping polarization: formal education, income, age,\nreligiosity, and trust in mass media. Adult attachment was\nconceptualized as an independent variable because it derives\ntheoretically from infant attachment, a process occurring in\nthe first few years of life. Gender was also considered an\nindependent variable because it is determined before birth.\n1Research Solutions, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nCecilie Gaziano, Consultant, Research Solutions, Inc., 4511 Fremont\nEmail: cgaziano@prodigy.net\nAdult Attachment Style and Political\nIdeology\nCecilie Gaziano1\n Keywords\nadult attachment, ideology, religiosity, media trust, socioeconomic status, political psychology\n2 SAGE Open\nThe earliest relationships that humans know influence\ntheir perceptions of power and authority (Ainsworth, Blehar,\nlogical orientations, in part, are based in attitudes toward\npower and authorities.\nIndependent Variable: Attachment Theory\nInfant attachment. Adult attachment conceptualizations build\non infant attachment theory, although there are many differ-\nences between these areas. Infant attachment is a process that\nprovides \"internal working models\" for relationships\nthroughout life and for development of cognitive skills, trust,\nconfidence, and motivation to learn as the child matures\nThe attachment process develops from the interaction pat-\ntern of the primary caregiver and the infant and is defined by\nhow well the caregiver can respond to the emotional needs of\nthe infant. Parents who consistently provide comfort from\nanxiety and distress tend to foster secure attachments in their\nbabies. Those parents who do not respond to their infants'\nemotional needs with dependable regularity are likely to pro-\nmote insecure attachments. Securely attached infants learn to\ntrust their caregiver as a safe base from which to explore\nInsecurely attached children have learned not to trust that\ntheir caregiver will comfort their anxieties and provide\nsafety; they tend to feel powerless, have low self-esteem, and\napproach relationships with trepidation.\nTypes of attachment. Attachments, therefore, may be secure or\ninsecure, and insecure attachments are divided into three\nmain categories: anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant (Ain-\nsworth et al., 1978), and disorganized (Main & Solomon,\n1986). The latter type has seldom been studied in adults and\nis not discussed here. Ambivalence is characterized by hyper-\nactive attachment behavior in search of security: fear of aban-\ndonment, high anxiety, and desire to merge with other people\nious-ambivalent styles (ambivalent-worry, or tendency to\nworry about loss, and ambivalent-merger, or desire for close-\nness). Avoidance involves lowering anxiety by deactivating\nthe attachment system, restricting close relationships and\nemotional connections with others, relying on the self, and\nseeking control over others (Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998;\nResearch on adult attachment and ideology.Studies of adult\nattachment as a psychological aspect of political ideology in\ncollege students, either in experiments or surveys in the\nUnited States, yield conflicting results (Dunkel & Decker,\n2008). Student samples diverge enough from nonstudent\nsamples in political interest and knowledge and other charac-\nteristics that general population samples should be preferred\nwhen studying such constructs (Koleva & Rip, 2009). Peter-\nson (2001) also raised the question of differences found\nbetween college student samples and the general population\nin effect sizes and directionality.\nFour student studies of adult attachment style and ideology\nmeasured ideology as conservatism/liberalism (Dunkel &\nnance orientation (SDO) and/or right-wing authoritarianism\n(RWA), concepts not part of the present research (Thornhill &\nA fifth inquiry into these relationships (Gillath & Hart, 2010)\nlooked solely at priming effects, and two analyses (Weber &\ntheir research. Primes were unrelated to liberalism/conserva-\ntivism and are not discussed further. Dunkel and Decker\n(2012) found that ambivalent and avoidant attachments were\nrelated to liberalism, and Thornhill and Fincher (2007)\nobserved that secure attachments were associated with an\nindicator of conservatism, C-Scale scores. In contrast, Weise\net al. (2008) reported that security of attachment was associ-\nated with liberal ideology. Weber and Federico (2007)\nreported a significant positive indirect effect of anxious\nattachment on left-right placement (a scale combining ideol-\nogy and partisanship, where high scores indicated greater\nconservativism/Republicanism), through RWA and a ten-\ndency to view the world as dangerous.\nMeasurement of adult attachment. The student studies varied\nin how they operationalized attachment. Two relied on the\nAdult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ; Dunkel & Decker,\nin Close Relationships (ECR) measure (Weber & Federico,\n2007), and one used the Relationship Scales Questionnaire\nThe current study used another gauge, the Measure of\nAttachment Qualities (MAQ; Carver, 1997), selected as the\nmost appropriate measure in a general population survey\nbecause it is much shorter than the RSQ or ECR and a little\nshorter than the AAQ. Brevity was important because the\nquestionnaires were limited to 50 questions. It has been used\neffectively in previous research (Carver, 1997; Hollist &\nDependent Variable: Ideology\ninterrelated set of moral and political attitudes\" that organize\npeople's values and beliefs, guide and explain political behav-\nior, and are relatively stable over time (p. 653). Conservatives\ntend to support traditional attitudes and values, maintain cau-\ntion in innovation or change, and emphasize respect for\nauthority, obedience, and self-discipline in child-rearing.\nLiberals tend to be more open to social and political change,\nto support social equality, and to favor self-fulfillment, empa-\nthy, and nurturance in child-rearing (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski,\nThe present research concerns a liberal\u00adconservative scale\nof political views that has been a staple of American public\nopinion polls and related research. The majority of studies of\nadult attachment relational style and ideology analyzed by\nKoleva and Rip (2009) measured ideology on a unidimensional\nscale anchored at each end by liberalism and conservatism.\nVarious scales measure ideological dimensions, such as\nMost treatments of political ideology have focused on the left\u00ad\nright (or, especially in the United States, the liberalism\u00ad\n1990). . . Although the left\u00adright distinction is by no means\nairtight, it has been the single most useful and parsimonious way\nto classify political attitudes for more than 200 years. (p. 654)\nA check of questions measuring political ideology during the\npast 40 years or more used by major organizations such as\nthe American National Election Studies (ANES), the\nNational Opinion Research Center, the Pew Research Center,\nand the Roper Center supports this conclusion.\nResearch Question 1: Is adult attachment a predictor of\npolitical ideology in a general population sample?\nIntervening Variables\nVariables that may influence the relationship between attach-\nment and ideology were measured. These included trust in\nmass media reporting, two other related types of trust, interest\nin news and public affairs, religiosity, and demographics.\nTrust in mass media and other trust.Three types of trust\nappear in much political and mass communication research:\ntrust in media to report news accurately and fairly, trust in\npeople, and trust in government to act fairly and democrati-\ncally. Trust in people and trust in government are vital ante-\ncedents to political participation (Moy & Scheufele, 2000).\nIf social segments and news media are segregated ideologi-\ncally, then media distrust impedes the political process\nbecause widespread publication of news is essential in a\nPublic affairs interest.This variable was included in initial\nanalyses because attachment in infants sets the course for\ninterest in new experiences and ideas, deriving from a sense\nof agency and competence (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Suess,\nGrossmann, & Sroufe, 1992). It may also be connected to\nadults' interest in public affairs. Public affairs interest is\nrelated to political knowledge and participation (Eveland &\nReligiosity. Several studies demonstrate that people compre-\nhend complicated or controversial issues such as abortion or\nglobal warming using their value predispositions, many of\nwhich tend to be religious values or heuristic cues from news\nmedia, religious institutions, political elites, and other\nresearchers operationalize religiosity as evaluation of the\nimportance of religion in respondents' lives and their fre-\nquency of attending religious services (Brossard et al., 2009;\nDemographics. Education, in particular, as well as household\nincome, age, gender, and race are indicators of ideological\nResearch Question 2: Which other variables are related\nto adult attachment, and how are they related to each\nother?\nMethod\nParticipants. A random national general population sample in\nthe United States (N = 330) was obtained from SurveyMon-\nkey at www.surveymonkey.com between September 27 and\ninvited to participate. The 50-question survey, \"Opinions\nAbout Topics in the News, Interpersonal, and Social Issues,\"\ntook about 10 min to complete. Two additional samples were\ndrawn in 2014 and are reported later. SurveyMonkey is an\nonline survey site that maintains a large, diverse, national\npanel of people who have completed a profile survey and\nhave agreed to respond to surveys commissioned by Survey-\nMonkey customers. The company reports that it maintains\nregular benchmarking surveys to help ensure that panel mem-\nbers are representative of the population. SurveyMonkey\naudiences do not receive money. They receive credits toward\ndonations to charitable organizations and sweepstakes entries.\nSurveyMonkey removes any information identifying respon-\ndents before the data are given to investigators. Advantages\nof an Internet survey are cost-effectiveness and speed.\n4 SAGE Open\nDisadvantages are that American adults with Internet access\ntend to be of higher socioeconomic status (SES) than those\nwho lack access and may be different in other ways from non-\nInternet samples (see, for example, Zickuhr & Rainie, 2013).\nIndependent variables\nAdult attachment. The MAQ is a self-report measure of\nadult attachment containing 14 items with four Likert-type\ncategories, ranging from \"disagree with the statement a lot\"\nto \"agree with the statement a lot\" (Carver, 1997; Kim &\nCarver, 2007). Four subscales containing three to five items\nassess secure, avoidant, ambivalent-worry, and ambivalent-\nmerger patterns. Examples of items are \"It feels relaxing\nand good to be close to someone\" and \"I prefer not to be\ntoo close to others.\"3 Responses to the four subscales were\nsummed according to Carver's directions. The subscales\nhad adequate internal consistency: security,  = .71; avoid-\nant,  = .80; ambivalent-worry,  = .77; and ambivalent-\nmerger,  = .75. Summary statistics for variables are in the\nappendix. Because the numbers of statements for each type\nof attachment were unequal, responses were averaged.\nGender. This is described under \"Demographics\" section\nbelow.\nDependent variable: Ideology. Respondents were asked, \"Here\nis a 7-point scale on which the political views that people\nmight hold are arranged from extremely liberal to extremely\nconservative. Where would you place yourself on this scale?\"\nParticipants also were asked which political party described\ntheir views the best on a 7-point scale ranging from \"strong\nRepublican\" to \"strong Democrat,\" recoded so that high\nmeant strong Republican; however, party identification was\nnot used in the present analysis because it was highly corre-\nIntervening variables\nTrust in government, media, and people.The questions\nwere (a) \"How much of the time do you think you can trust\nthe federal government in Washington to make decisions in\na fair way?\" (b) \"How much of the time do you think you\ncan trust the media to report the news fairly?\" (c) \"Gener-\nally speaking, how often can you trust other people?\" The\nquestions used 5-point scales and were separated in the ques-\ntionnaire. Answer categories were always, most of the time,\nabout half the time, once in a while, and never (recoded so\nthat high scores denoted high trust).\nInterest in public affairs. People were asked how interested\nthey were in what was going on in government and public\naffairs on a 5-point scale anchored by \"extremely interested\"\nand \"not interested at all\" (recoded so that high scores signi-\nfied high interest).\nReligiosity. Participants rated the importance of religion in\ntheir lives and their frequency of attending religious services\non 5-point scales. The end points were \"extremely important\"\nand \"not important at all\" for the first measure and \"every\nweek\" to \"never\" for the second. Responses were combined\nto form a religiosity score, averaged, and recoded so that high\nscores meant highly religious (Cronbach's  = .86).\nDemographics. Participants were asked the year they were\nborn, the last grade they completed in school, household\nincome, gender, and race. Age was measured as continuous,\nand the others were measured as categories. Compared with\ncensus data (Table 1), the sample overrepresented women,\nthe middle-aged, and people with higher education and\nhousehold incomes. Minority racial groups were not well\nrepresented, and race was discarded from additional analy-\nsis. A t-test comparison of the sample mean and the mean of\na sample from the ANES4 in 2012 using the identical ques-\ntion about ideology showed that the present study signifi-\ntwo-tailed). Table 1 shows two additional 2014 samples, to\nbe discussed later as Study 2.\nAnalytical method.Causal modeling with path analysis in a\nstructural equation model with maximum likelihood estima-\ntion in AMOS 23.0 was selected to evaluate the potential\nrelationships with attachment and to estimate how well these\nvariables fit the model for each of the three samples. Path\nanalysis allows the consideration of both direct and indirect\neffects of exogenous variables on dependent variables. Cau-\nsality is inferred for gender and security of adult attachment,\nthe observed exogenous variables, as those variables precede\nthe others in time order. Observed endogenous variables\nwere trust in mass media to report news fairly, trust in the\ngovernment to make fair decisions, religiosity, public affairs\ninterest, respondents' age, education, household income, and\nideology. Unobserved exogenous variables were error vari-\nances that cause response variation in the observed endoge-\nnous variables. Structural equation modeling permits\nmultiple pathways through intervening variables. Figure 1\npresents the conceptual model.\nFigures 2 to 4, below, report standardized regression coef-\nficients that attained statistical significance. Standardized\nregression coefficients () range from +1.0 to -1.0 and allow\ndirect comparisons of the relative strength of each predictor\nin a model and comparisons of results across the figures.\nStudy 1 Results\nTable 2 provides the correlations among ideology, the four\nattachment variables, religiosity, the three trust items, public\naffairs interest, and three demographic variables. Among the\nattachment measures, highest relationship was between secu-\nrity and avoidance (negative) and between ambivalent-worry\nand ambivalent-merger (positive). These results were similar\net al., 2008). Correlations among the other attachment vari-\nables were moderate. Security was significantly and\nnegatively related to ideology and was the only attachment\nitem retained for further analysis. (Worry was related to ideol-\nogy only at r = .10, p < .10, and initial testing in a path model\nshowed that the relationship decreased markedly when other\nvariables were taken into account.) Ideology was significantly\nand positively correlated with religiosity and significantly\nand negatively correlated with media trust and government\ntrust but unrelated to trust in people. Media trust was uncor-\nrelated with religiosity, though it might have been expected to\nbe associated because Golan and Day (2010) reported mixed\nevidence of a relationship in their investigation of media\ncredibility and religiosity. Public affairs interest was not\nrelated to any of the other variables at .05 or less, and it was\ndiscarded from further tests as was trust in people.\nA structural equation model was estimated for hypothesis\ntesting in a path analysis in which attachment security and\ngender were exogenous variables and were allowed to have\ndirect effects on religiosity, media trust, government trust,\nage, education, household incomes, and ideology. Then reli-\ngiosity, trust in media reporting, trust in government, age,\neducation, and income were permitted to have direct effects\non ideology.\nThe resulting path model is given in Figure 2, showing\nstandardized coefficients. The model was a good fit to the\n26 distinct parameters to be estimated), N = 330, CMIN/df =\n.993 (chi-square statistic that is the minimum value of the\ndiscrepancy between the model and the data, divided by its\ndegrees of freedom), Bentler's comparative fit index (CFI) =\nsquare error of approximation (RMSEA) = .001. The criteria\nconsidered desirable for goodness of fit statistics were the\nfollowing: a nonsignificant chi-square, RMSEA less than\n.05, CFI and TLI of .95 or higher, and CMIN/df of less than\nthe hypothesized model well.\nThe first research question asked if adult attachment was\nrelated to political ideology. Figure 2 shows that security of\nattachment had a direct effect of  = \u00ad.12 (p < .05) on ideol-\nogy. In addition, the standardized coefficient for an indirect\neffect was  = \u00ad.03, for a standardized total effect of  = \u00ad.15.\nThe negative sign indicated that liberals were higher in secu-\nrity than conservatives.

Secure attachment\nalso was a significant predictor of trust in media reporting\nand possessing higher household incomes. Gender had no\ndirect effect on ideology, and its indirect effect was negligi-\nble. The only effect of gender was on household income,  =\n\u00ad.12 (p < .05), indicating that men tended more than women\nto have higher household incomes. Distrust of government\nand distrust of media were significantly related to conserva-\ntism, as were being older, less educated, and having higher\nhousehold incomes. Religiosity was a significant predictor of\nconservative ideology at  = .40 (p < .001) and was the most\nrelated to ideology, among all the variables.\nDiscussion\nInspired by a desire to untangle the relations between adult\nattachment and ideology because of mixed results in previous\nresearch, the present study sought to explore this relationship\nin a general population sample. The primary finding was that\nsecure attachment was a significant predictor of liberal ideol-\nogy. No known previous research on ideological orientation\nand attachment style has included media trust or government\ntrust. Secure adult attachment led to trust in media, and media\ntrust predicted liberalism. Security was not significantly\nrelated to trust in government, but government trust was cor-\nrelated with media trust and also predicted liberalism.\nImportance of religion predicted conservatism, consonant\nwith other research (Gaziano, 2014). Religion was not a sig-\nnificant predictor in Thornhill and Fincher's (2007) work,\nbut their operational definition of religiosity may have been\ntoo simple to achieve predictive ability. It was a variable\ncoded as \"1 = religion\" and \"0 = no religion.\"\nOlder age, lower education, and higher household incomes\nalso predicted conservatism. Previous research has found con-\nservatives tending to have lower education than liberals but\ntending to have higher household incomes than liberals (Diercks\nMethod\nParticipants.A national random sample of U.S. adults 18\nyears or older (N = 223) and a separate national random\nFigure 1.

Ten questions comprising an Ideo-\nlogical Consistency Scale (ICS) used by the Pew Research\nCenter (2014) were included as a check on the validity of the\n7-point scale measuring ideology, and a high correlation\nbetween them increased confidence in the liberal\u00adconservative\nscale. Respondents chose the one statement in a pair of state-\nments that came closer to their views, where one statement rep-\nresented a conservative point of view, and one represented a\nliberal stance. For example, \"Government regulation of busi-\nness usually does more harm than good\" (conservative) OR\n\"Government regulation of business is necessary to protect the\npublic interest\" (liberal). Conservative responses were scored\n\"+1,\" and liberal responses were scored \"\u00ad1.\" Don't know/\nrefused/volunteered responses counted as \"0.\" Responses were\nsummed to form the scale (Cronbach's  = .78, general popula-\ntion sample; .58, conservative sample).

Ideology and security were inversely related but\nnot significant in the general population sample. Contrary to\nthese results, in the conservative sample, ideology and secu-\nrity were positively and significantly correlated.\nFigure 3 illustrates the results of the path analysis in the\npopulation at large in 2014, including the same variables as\nin Figure 2, except for government trust.

Despite being small and not sig-\nnificant, the direction of relationship mirrored that in the\n2013 sample, that is, that security was related to liberalism.\nGender directly affected ideology in a significant negative\npattern, indicating that men were more conservative than\nwomen. This result was not observed in Figure 2.\nThe patterns of the relationships of media trust, religios-\nity, age, and education to ideology were similar to those in\nStudy 1. Media trust was negatively related to conservative\nideology,  = \u00ad.11 (but only p < .10), and religiosity was\npositively correlated with conservative ideology,  = .41 (p <\n.001). The direct effect of security of attachment on income\nwas similarly positive and significant,  = .13 (p < .05).\nSecurity also directly affected education ( = .18, p < .01).\nAge affected ideology as in Study 1, but only at p < .10.\nFigure 4 depicts the results for the conservative sample.\nThe model achieved a satisfactory fit to the hypothesized\nHere, secure style of attachment was directly, positively,\nand significantly related to ideology ( = .14, p < .05), with\nno indirect effect. The direction of this relationship was\nopposite of that found in Figures 2 and 3.

Women\ntended more than men to have faith in fairness of media\nreporting, a pattern that did not occur in the other two sam-\nples. The conservative sample differed from the general pop-\nulation sample in 2014 in the lack of relationships between\nsecurity and media trust or between gender and ideology. It\nwas like the other two samples in the relation of low media\ntrust and high religiousness to conservatism.\nLimitations\nThe Internet samples were of significantly higher SES and\ndiffered somewhat in age from census data from the 2013\npopulation samples underrepresented men, and the 2014\nconservative sample overrepresented men.

These differences\nweaken the ability of this study to generalize to the popula-\ntion at large. Ideally, the research should be repeated with\nlarger, more representative samples. Because the present\nresearch and the four previous reports on college students'\nideology and attachment have been with samples in the\nUnited States, such work should be carried out in other parts\nof the globe among different kinds of populations.\nIn addition, ideology in the present research was measured\nas self-placement on a single 7-point self-report item.Although\nnumerous polls and surveys have found this type of measure to\nbe reliable and valid, other measures of liberalism and conser-\nvatism could be used for a more multidimensional examina-\ntion of ideology. In 2014, results for ideology were compared\nwith a measure of ideological consistency known to be a valid\nand reliable indicator of political philosophy over time (Pew\nFigure 4.

Interest in news of government and public affairs was not\na predictor, but it may have been too general. Interest levels\ntended to be similarly high among liberals and conservatives\nand lagged among independents. The relation of ideology and\ninterest in specific politically contested public affairs and sci-\nence issues could be investigated further.\nNot including government trust in the 2014 studies can be\ncriticized as this variable was useful in the 2013 research. It\ncould be included in future work.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nPolitical polarization is of increasing concern in the United\nStates because it has intensified since the 1970s. The present\nresearch concerned adult relational attachment style as a\npotential contributor to ideological divisions. Only a few stud-\nies have examined this, primarily in college student samples,\nand their results differ. The present research contributes to the\nliterature because it is the first one to focus on the relationship\nof adult attachment to ideology in general population samples.\nThe main findings are as follows.\nStudy 1: General Population Sample\nLiberals scored significantly higher than conservatives in\nsecure attachment relational style. Secure attachment was sig-\nnificantly related to trust in media reporting and also to hav-\ning higher household incomes. As would be expected,\nconservatives were significantly more likely than liberals to\nbe religious and to distrust both government and mass media.\nOther significant predictors of conservatism were being older\nand less educated but possessing higher household incomes.\nReligiosity and media trust were uncorrelated. Gender, con-\nceptualized as an independent variable, made no difference in\nideology and was associated significantly only with house-\nhold income, meaning that men had higher incomes.\nTable 3.

The other independent variable, gender,\nhowever, was significantly and negatively related to ideol-\nogy, meaning that men were more conservative than women.\nGender had no effects on other variables. Security was posi-\ntively and significantly associated with education and\nincomes. Conservatism was linked to lower trust in media\nbut only at p < .10. It was strongly related to religiosity, as\nwell as to lower education. There was a positive association\nwith age, only at p < .10. Again, religiosity and media trust\nwere unrelated.\nStudy 2: Conservative Sample\nSecure attachment style was a significant and positive pre-\ndictor of conservatism, contrary to the positive relationship\nin Study 1 and the lack of significant relationship in the\nStudy 2 general population sample. As in Study 1 and Study\n2 general population groups, security and household incomes\nwere positively and significantly correlated. Consistent with\nthe other two sample results, being religious was highly\nrelated to conservatism. Also congruent with the other two\ngroups' results, media trust was not connected to being reli-\ngious. Lack of trust in media fairness of reporting and being\nreligious independently had significant direct impacts on\nideology. Neither education nor income had an effect on\npolitical ideology. Gender had a positive, significant effect\non media trust, meaning that women were more trusting of\nmedia, and it was negatively linked to household incomes,\nmeaning that men's incomes were higher.\nSecurity and ideology. Although most findings were relatively\nconsistent in the three samples, the relationships of secure\nattachment style and ideology clearly were different in each\none. Results for the previous studies of college student sam-\nples were mixed, also. These results, taken together, demon-\nstrate that both liberals and conservatives can have secure\nattachments.\nSecurity and SES.Security was consistently positively and\nsignificantly linked to household income in all three sam-\nples, and security positively and directly affected education\nin the 2014 sample of the general public. All the previous\nstudies of college students and the present study concerned\nprimarily more advantaged social groups. Perhaps greater\nSES promotes more secure attachments, regardless of politi-\ncal leanings.\nIdeology and SES.Household income was significantly and\npositively connected to ideology only in 2013, but education\nwas negatively and significantly related to ideology in both the\ngeneral population samples. The finding of lower education\ndirectly influencing conservatism is consistent with other\nresearch that has reported lower education characterizing con-\nservatives (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, & Sanford,\nunusual to find that conservatives, especially if better educated,\nhave higher household incomes than well-educated liberals,\neven though conservatives tend to be less well educated overall\nYan, 2015). Well-educated liberals tended to be younger and in\nearlier stages of the life cycle than well-educated conservatives\nin Gaziano (2014). Better educated liberals were more likely\nthan better educated conservatives to have advanced degrees.\nFuture Research\nAt least four areas of future study come to mind. These\ninclude analyses of adult attachment relational style in lower\nSES groups, attachment style and types of information envi-\nronments, the relationship of attachment style and further\nelaboration of the models of nurturant parent and strict par-\nent families, and examination of attachment styles in groups\nwith extreme political attitudes. As most of the research so\nfar has been done in the United States, research should be\ncarried out in other countries, as well. Although the models\ndid well enough in this study, they could be refined further\nand new concepts tested.\nFirst, the results suggest that future research should\nemphasize the relationship of ideology to attachment in pop-\nulation segments with lower education and incomes. While\nthe current project found security to be more relevant to ide-\nological orientation than avoidance or anxiety, future\nresearchers should concentrate more on forms of insecure\nattachment in lower SES groups with regard to a range of\nsocial and economic issues. The 2016 U.S. election points up\nthe need to better understand the needs and concerns of\nWhite working class population segments, as well as other\nlower and working class ethnic and racial segments. For\nWhite working class groups, declining economic and job\nopportunities was a primary element in their vote decisions\n(Wan, 2017). Related elements were rising rates of mortality\nand morbidity among these groups (Achenbach & Keating,\nthan higher SES groups to feel like strangers in their own\ncountry (Cox, Lienesch, & Jones, 2017). In general, voters of\nvarious SES groups who supported Donald J. Trump for\npresident tended to support racist attitudes (Wood, 2017), to\naccept false information and untruths that support one's\nviews (Sykes, 2017), and to defend vulgarity, crude behav-\nior, and bullying (Martin, 2017). The social conditions that\nfoster such beliefs and attitudes could be delved into with an\neye to addressing solutions to these issues.\nFactors that promote less secure attachment styles among\nlower SES groups may help to explain attitudes and beliefs in\nthese groups. Complicating factors in the links between lower\nSES and insecure attachment is that lower SES families are\nvulnerable to multiple stresses of poverty, such as poorer\nhealth, lack of stable employment, teen parent and/or single-\nparent status, and living in more crowded conditions, which\ncan drain parents physically and emotionally and consequently\nconstrain their ability to parent as well as they would wish\n(Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, & Bradley, 2005;\nSecond, security of attachment style and types of infor-\nmation channels may yield insights into the consequences of\nfragmented media environments and insular discussion net-\nworks as political polarization increases. These processes\nmay have implications for knowledge and belief gaps, flows\nof inaccurate information, and tolerance of differing view-\nNumbers and types of information networks can be explored.\nResearchers have revealed sociological fault lines in the dis-\nsemination of information in mainstream and partisan news\nsources and ideological blogs (Eveland & Dylko, 2007;\nFragmentation can lead to decreased understanding of con-\nflicting views and diminished tolerance for diversity, particu-\nlarly among more partisan groups who may be among the\neasiest to mobilize to support political candidates for office\nThird, attachment styles could be studied further within\nthe framework of nurturant parent and strict parent families,\nand further insights could be gained by refining the concep-\ntualization of liberals as coming from nurturant parent fami-\nlies versus conservatives as coming from strict parent\nLakoff, 2002). These conceptualizations currently may be\ntoo simplistic. One avenue for future research in adults is\nretrospective recall of perceived parenting styles or longitu-\ndinal studies from childhood or adolescence through adult-\nhood. One approach could be contrasting parental\ndemandingness, or control, with parental responsiveness, or\ncould be gained from comparing family communication pat-\nFourth, attachment and extreme ideologies should be\nstudied more. An interesting example is that of Roccato\nand Ricolfi (2005), who examined six nonstudent right-\nwing and left-wing political militant groups in Turin and\nPalermo, Italy. While avoidantly attached participants\nwere far less religious than securely attached participants\nin the present study, the Italian study described one group\nof activists who were the most overtly antidemocratic,\nright-wing, and avoidant in attachment style, yet who were\nalso among the most religious of the militants. This sug-\ngests that additional insights into attachment and ideology\nmay be gained by studying politically active groups of dif-\nferent types.\nAppendix\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
