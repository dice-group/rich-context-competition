Using a nationally representative sample of the U.S. school-aged adolescents in\n2009\u00ad2010, we estimate a structural model that accounts for the potential biases in the esti-\nmate of the peer effect. Our peer group is exogenously assigned and includes one year\nolder adolescents in the same school grade as the respondent. The peer measure is based\non peers' own reports of video gaming time. We find that an additional one hour of playing\nvideo games per week by older grade-mates results in .47 hours increase in video gaming\ntime by male responders. We do not find significant peer effect among female responders.\nEffective policies aimed at influencing the time that adolescents spend video gaming should\ntake these findings into account.\n",

Players under the age of 18\naccount for about one-quarter of the audience of this growing industry and as the games\nbecome increasingly realistic, there has been growing concern among parents, the media and\nthe research community about important social and behavioral effects of video gaming on ado-\nThe existing literature suggests significant social, behavioral and clinical effects of video\ngaming. Some of the literature has linked violent video games to aggressive and antisocial\nbehaviors among children and adolescents. Early literature suggests that excessive arcade video\ngaming may develop into a behavior which resembles a gambling addiction [4]. It was found\nthat children who play more video games are more likely to behave violently and get into argu-\nments [5]. This relationship was confirmed in another study of 8th and 9th graders in the U.S.\nMidwestern schools [6] and later in meta-analysis [5] found this relationship to exist in differ-\nent cultures. Another study [7] found the opposite to be true for pro-social video games. Some\nstudies investigated the link to school performance and attention and found a negative effect of\nvideo games on school performance [6,8] and college engagement [9]. However another study\n[10] found that video gaming had no significant relationship to poor academic performance\nCitation: Amialchuk A, Kotalik A (2016) Do Your\nSchool Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nEditor: Susana Jim\u00e9nez-Murcia, Hospital Universitari\nde Bellvitge, SPAIN\nCopyright: \u00a9 2016 Amialchuk, Kotalik.

It was found that video gaming among girls was associ-\nated with higher odds of getting into a serious fight and carrying a weapon to school [3].\nAmong other studies, [11] found a link between video gaming and sleep disorders and hyperac-\ntivity, [12] found a link to attention deficits and [13] using longitudinal data found some evi-\ndence of relationship between gaming at age 8 or 9 and behavioral and psychological problems\nmeasured at age 15. Yet, in a recent experiment on adults with and without autism [14], there\nwas found no effect of violent-video-game exposure on aggressive behavior in either group.\nMoreover, in a recent meta-analysis, It was concluded [15] that video games have little influ-\nence on several children's and adolescents' behaviors, including aggression, mental health, pro-\nsocial behavior, and academic performance. Also, it was noted that women are often\nmisrepresented in video games [16], however there was no relationship found between video\ngame use and sexist attitudes towards women using a 3 year longitudinal study of adolescent\nstudents in Germany [16]. Other literature has documented several positive effects of video\ngaming. It was found that video gaming was associated with lower odds of smoking in boys\nand lower odds of reporting depression in girls [3]; and gaming was not found to be associated\nwith alcohol, drug or caffeine consumption or body-mass index [3]. In a longitudinal study of\nstudents in Canada over 4 years [17], it was found that playing sports video games is associated\nwith participating in active sports more. In addition, experienced gamers have been found to\nhave superior visual, spatial and attention skills [18,19,20]. Consistent with this strand of litera-\nture, a recent study using functional MRI scanning of the participant gamers [21], found that\nviolent video games result in aggression desensitization and improvements in spatial attention.\nMoreover, several successful health interventions among children and adolescents used video-\ngame format [22]. The link between video gaming and these important outcomes warrants\nexamination of the factors that might change video gaming behavior of adolescents.\nIn this paper, we focus on estimating peer effects in the time spent video gaming by adoles-\ncents in the U.S. The literature hypothesized that the social network and peer influence play an\nimportant role in video gaming behavior of adolescents. Support to this hypothesis is lent by\nsurvey data, which indicated that video gaming often happens in group setting--with friends\nor family members [23,24]. If peer effects in video gaming activities exist, such peer effects\n\"may serve to amplify the effects of interventions\" targeted at changing behavior of individual\nMost of the previous research on peer influence has looked at screen time in general, which\nincluded television watching, video gaming and internet usage [26,27,28]. Fletcher [26] used\nnationally-representative survey of U.S. adolescents in grades 7 through 12 in 1996 and found\nthat an increase in average school-level television viewing by one hour was associated with an\nalmost half an hour increase in television viewing by an adolescent. Liu et al. [27] investigated\ninvolvement in screen activities by U.S. adolescents in grades 7\u00ad12 in 1994 using an aggregate\nof hours a week that students watched television, videos or played video or computer games\nbut did not find a significant peer effect of nominated friends on an adolescent. Sirard et al.\n[28] used a cross sectional study (n = 2126) in 20 middle schools and high schools in Minneap-\nolis/St. Paul MN during the 2009\u00ad2010 academic year and found that every additional hour of\na best female friend's screen time (watching TV/DVDs/videos, using a computer not for home-\nwork, and Xbox/Play-Station/other electronic games played when sitting) was associated with\nan additional 15 minutes of screen time per week for high school boys. While general screen\ntime includes video gaming, a large proportion of it is comprised of television viewing. An\nimportant difference between television viewing and video gaming is the level of involvement\nand the type of activity: Unlike television watching, video games provide a place for social\ninteraction both online and face-to-face, and the content of video games can be modified by\ninteraction of player with the game and with other players. Only one recent study [29] focused\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\non video gaming and found a statistically significant peer effect in console use time in a repre-\nsentative survey of secondary school students aged 14\u00ad16 in Catalonia (Spain) in 2008, with an\nadditional hour increase in console gaming by nominated friends within the classroom leading\nto an increase in individual's gaming by 5 minutes among boys but no effect among girls.\nThe existing research into peer effects in media consumption (including video gaming) has\nseveral flaws and shortcomings, which we attempt to address in this study. Most importantly,\nmost studies used outdated data, convenience samples or failed to address statistical issues sur-\nrounding the estimation of peer effects. For example, samples from 1996 and 1995 were used\nto look at television viewing and general screen activities [26,27]. However, the development of\n128-bit gaming systems (also known as 6th generation systems, including Sony PlayStation 2,\nNintendo GameCube, and Microsoft Xbox) in 1998 allowed for development of much more\nrealistic video games, which could change the nature of the experience. Furthermore, this new\ntechnology could have potentially changed the type of audience playing these games and the\nnature of social interactions, as these devices saw a significant rise in the popularity of large-\nscale online gaming, namely with the introduction of Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayS-\ntation Network online gaming platforms in 2002 and 2006 respectively. Today, these platforms\nprovide a unified gaming experience and cater to millions of console, PC and even smartphone\ngamers. It seems likely that such platforms make online gaming much more accessible and\nappealing to a wide audience, while previously online gaming was more restricted to tech-\nsavvy PC gamers. These innovations coincided with the rapid increase in popularity of video\ngaming since late 1990's; only four out of the ten best-selling video game consoles in history\ngame-consoles-sold-worldwide-by-console-type/ accessed on June 16, 2014). Even today,\nvideo gaming constantly evolves into a more realistic and immersive experience, yet most stud-\nies on media consumption were conducted using data that preceded this expansion. Another\nimportant aspect of modern video games and consoles is that many of them can be played on-\nline with friends and even strangers and do not require physical presence of the participants\u00ad\nwhich is in contrast to the previous generations in arcades that were mainly played only in\nsocial spheres or together in the sofa.\nWhile some of the existing studies rely on more recent data, the data used were quite limited\nin coverage: Sirard et al. [28], who studied peer effects in general screen time, only used data\ncollected in the state of Minnesota; Escard\u00edbul et al. [29], who studied peer effects in video gam-\ning time, used only data from Catalonia, an autonomous community of Spain. The results\nfrom these limited samples might not directly apply to other populations in light of a signifi-\ncant variability across human populations in terms of psychology, motivation, and behavior\nThere are also methodological issues that arise when estimating behavioral peer effects. As\nnoted by Manski [31], the identification of (endogenous) peer effects is difficult because of the\n\"reflection problem\"--the fact that individuals tend to select their peers, may face similar envi-\nronment or select each other based on common traits or interests (correlated effects), or may\nbe influenced by peers' background characteristics (contextual effects). If these are the main\ndriving forces behind the correlation in peers' behavior, a policy aimed at changing video gam-\ning habits will not have a ripple effect among individuals who were not directly affected by the\npolicy. The previous analysis of peer effects [29] may suffer from the selection concerns; while\nthey utilized the relevant peer group of nominated friends in the same classroom, estimates\nbased on the peer group of nominated friends within the same classroom are likely suffer from\npeer selection [31] that might not be properly controlled for by the included observable covari-\nates at the individual and classroom levels. Escard\u00edbul et al. [29] tried to address the reflection\nproblem by using a convincing identification strategy--by utilizing characteristics of the\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nrespondents' friends-of-friends who are not friends with the respondent--as instruments for\npeers' video gaming. However, the intransitivity property of the peer network, which requires\nthat some of the students are not directly related as friends but only via others, is unlikely to\nhold if some students under-report their friendships.\nOur updated analysis relies on a recent nationally representative sample of the U.S. school-\naged adolescents in 2009\u00ad2010 school year. Our empirical methods account for the problems\nof contextual effects, correlated effects, and peer selection and thereby reduce the potential\nbiases from the estimates of peer effects. Our peer group is comprised of non-nominated\npeers\u00adolder adolescents in the same grade in the school--who are unlikely to be selected by the\nindividual yet are likely to exert significant influence on video gaming behavior of an adoles-\ncent. We also use instrumental variable strategy where we use measures of peer's parental con-\ntrol and relationship as instruments. Our analysis also accounts for a number of individual and\nfamily-level covariates, which were identified in the literature as important determinants of\nvideo gaming behavior and the omission of which may bias the estimates of the peer effects.\nFor example, video gaming has been found to vary by gender, race and ethnicity, body weight,\nurban status, grade level in school, school performance, and socio-economic status of the\n[29], we explore whether the peer effect in video gaming time differs by gender. Thus, we pro-\npose the following two hypotheses:\n1. There is a significant peer effect in adolescents' video gaming time.\n2. Peer effect in video gaming time is stronger among males compared to females.\nData\nWe utilize data from Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC), which is a school-\nbased study of health-related attitudes and behaviors based on a series of cross-sectional\nlic, Catholic, and other private schools and who were enrolled in grades 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 or\ntheir equivalent in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In most schools in the U.S., edu-\ncation is divided into three levels: elementary school (kindergarten to 5th grade and ages 5\u00ad10),\nmiddle or junior high school (grades 6th to 8th and ages 11\u00ad13), and high school (grades 9th to\n12th and ages 14\u00ad18). In addition, education is mandatory starting between the ages of five and\neight and ending between ages sixteen and eighteen, depending on the state (\"US School Sys-\ntained and distributed to the general public free of charge (upon registration and agreement\nwith the terms of use) by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research.\n(Access and data download page for HBSC 2009\u00ad2010 is http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/\nare to monitor health-risk behaviors of adolescents in order to identify targets for health pro-\nmotion initiatives and to help explain the development of health attitudes and behaviors\nthrough early adolescence. HBSC contains extensive information on substance use (e.g.,\ntobacco, alcohol, and marijuana) and various health behaviors and attitudes (including video\ngaming, eating habits, physical activity, body image, health problems) in addition to demo-\ngraphic and socio-economic conditions of the student's family. (Detailed description of HBSC\naccessed on 06.08.2016). Students were also asked about their relationship with their parents\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nand the level of parental control over their activities. These questions are used for creating\ninstrumental variables (IV), which are used to help identify the peer effects. Because HBSC sur-\nveyed multiple students in the same school and grade, we were able to create same-grade peer\ngroup measure of video gaming.\nMeasure of Adolescent Video Gaming\nThe dependent variable of our analysis is a continuous variable measuring the number of\nhours a day that student spent video gaming and is based on the survey questions \"About how\nmany hours a day do you usually play games on a computer or games console (Playstation,\nXbox, GameCube, etc.) in your free time on weekdays/weekends?\" The reported number of\nhours played on weekdays multiplied by 5 was added to the number of hours played on week-\nends multiplied by 2 and the sum was divided by 7 to create a weighted average number of\nhours spent video gaming by the adolescent during a typical week.\nPeer Measure of Video Gaming\nOur peer measure of video gaming is based on co-location and is the average number of hours\nspent video gaming among students who are one year older than the respondent and belong to\nthe same grade level in the same school as the responder.\nPrevious studies of peer effects often used nominated peers [28,29] to define peer groups.\nThese groups usually include close friends that were nominated by the student. This appears to\nbe a reasonable approach to defining the relevant peer group, as students are likely to be\nengaged in discussions about gaming with their friends; they may also participate in gaming\ntogether. However, there are several methodological difficulties when trying to identify peer\neffects among nominated friends. Friends, who are frequently selected by the individual, are\nlikely to share similar background, interests and personalities. Thus, it is difficult to separate\nthe correlated effects from the endogenous peer effect. This is less of a problem when using\ngrade-level peers. While the degree of peer influence of grade-level peers is likely less than that\nof close friends, classmates and same-grade individuals were previously found to have a signifi-\ncant influence on various behaviors of adolescents [42,43,26,44]. Students often communicate\nand are exposed to gaming by other students in the same grade, and using grade-level peers\nwill allow us to capture the gaming culture and social norms pertaining to gaming within a\ngrade level.\nAn advantage of using grade-level peers is that they are assigned exogenously (based on age)\nand independently of other individual's characteristics that might be correlated with his/her\nvideo-gaming behavior. As a result, the estimated peer effects are less likely to capture corre-\nlated effects. In addition, because our grade-level peer measures are based on peers' own\nreports, they do not to suffer from the reporting bias from using respondents' own reports of\npeers' activities [45,46]. Friendship nominations, on the other hand, are likely to suffer from\nrecall bias when respondents are presented with a long roster [47]. Using older grade-mates as\na peer group also means that individual's own outcome is not present in the peer group mea-\nsure (peer group average). This allows to avoid the downward bias in the peer effect estimate,\nwhich usually results from the mechanical negative correlation between the individual's and\nthe peer group's outcome after systematically removing individual's own outcome from the\npeer group's outcome. This is sometimes referred to as \"regression to the mean\" in the peer\neffects literature [48]. If a students' hours video gaming are subtracted from calculating grade\naverage hours, the grade average hours will be negatively correlated with individual students'\nhours: For a student whose hours exceed grade average, grade average is below the student's\nhours, and vice versa.\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nFamily and Personal Characteristics\nOur multivariate analysis includes several important individual- and family-level determinants\nof video gaming among adolescents. Individual characteristics include sex, race (white, black,\nother race), Hispanic ethnicity, whether student is U.S. born, student's body mass index (BMI),\nwhether student has ever smoked, whether student is a current drinker, whether student used\ndrugs in the past year and whether student resides in an urban area. Other individual charac-\nteristics include a categorical measure of student-reported teacher's evaluation of student's per-\nformance on school tests (1\u00ad4, 1 for `Below average,' 2 for `Average,' 3 for `Good,' and 4 for\n`Very good') and a categorical measure of student's feeling about school (1\u00ad4, 1 for `I don't like\nit at all,' 2 for `I don't like it very much,' 3 for `I like it a bit,' and 4 for `I like it a lot'). We also\nuse indicators for student's school and grade level (grade 5 through grade 10 with grade 5 being\nan omitted category). Family-level variables include indicators of whether the student's father\nand mother have a job, whether he or she has siblings, whether mother and father are at home,\nwhether there is a second home, number of computers at home, and a categorical affluence\nscale measuring how wealthy the family is (1\u00ad9, 1 for `Low', 9 for `High').\nWe also use measures of parental control and relationship with the parent. Parental control\nand monitoring of adolescent's activities appears to be an important determinant of adolescent's\nmedia use [49], while lack of significant relationship with parent or lack of mutual attachment\nare important predictors of early onset of many risky behaviors [50,51,52]. The measures used in\nour analysis are based on six relevant questions answered by the student on a scale 1\u00ad3 (1 for\n`almost always,' 2 for `sometimes,' and 3 for `never'): \"Whether parent (or guardian) tries to con-\ntrol everything I do\"; \"Whether parent (or guardian) understands my problems\"; \"Whether par-\nent (or guardian) helps me as much as I need\"; \"Whether parent (or guardian) lets me make my\nown decisions\"; \"Whether parent (or guardian) is loving\"; and \"Whether parent (or guardian)\ntreats me like a baby\". The response `almost always' to each question was coded as one in order\nto create the corresponding binary indicator variables: \"Parent tries to control everything I do\" (0\nor 1), \"Parent understands my problems\" (0 or 1), \"Parent helps me as much as I need\" (0 or 1),\n\"Parent lets me make own decisions\" (0 or 1), \"Parent is loving\" (0 or 1) and \"Parent treats me\nlike a baby\" (0 or 1). These indicators of parental control and relationship also formed the basis\nof our instrumental variable identification strategy for estimating peer effects.\nThe full sample used in the analysis contains 11,888 observations with non-missing values\non all variables. In order to reduce measurement error in the estimates of peer group averages,\nwe only used peer group averages that were based on at least two observations. As a result, we\nhave 7,978 non-missing observations for the peer measure. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics\nfor the variables used in our analysis.\nEstimation Strategy\nManski [31] described empirical problems that arise when trying to estimate peer effects using\nobservational data by collectively referring to them as the \"reflection problem.\" Specifically, the\ncoefficient on the average peer outcome in a standard linear regression may have several inter-\npretations, which may not necessarily reflect behavioral response of an individual to social\ninfluence of his or her peers. Manski [31] pointed out three different interpretations for the\ncoefficient on the average peer outcome:\na. Endogenous effect\u00adindividual's behavioral response to changes in the behavior of others in\nhis or her peer group. This effect is present if video gaming among peers creates a social\nnorm and social acceptance of gaming and thus leads individual to increase his or her time\nplaying video games. Here, the behavior of peers leads to a change in behavior of an\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nVariable Mean (SD)/Number (%)\nDependent variable\nPeer measure (avgerage among older grade mates)\nGender\nRace\nEthnicity\nOther individual-level controls\nFamily-level controls\nRelationship with parent (or guardian), n (%)\nGrade level, n (%)\nInstrumental variables (peer average), n (%)\n(Continued)\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nindividual, whose behavior, in turn, becomes part of peer group's behavior. The policy sig-\nnificance of the existence of such a behavioral effect is that targeting some individuals in a\ngroup would affect the behavior of other individuals in the group.\nb. Exogenous (contextual) effect\u00adeffect of exogenous (background) characteristics of the peers\non individual's behavior. For example, if most peers come from households with permissive\nparenting style which allowed peers to spend long hours gaming, individual's own gaming\ncould also be high as a result. While exogenous effect is also a type of social influence, target-\ning the behavior of peers will not lead to the same effect as in the case of endogenous effect\nand the behavior of others in the peer group will not change.\nc. Correlated effect\u00addescribes similarities in behavior of individuals who share the same environ-\nment (e.g., geographical, institutional). For example, students in urban schools could all have\ngreater attachment to electronic gadgets compared to students from rural schools. Correlated\neffect also describes similarities in behavior of individuals who sort themselves into groups\nbased on personal traits. For example, students who have preference for sedentary activities\nmay be more likely to become friends. Again, if one of these students starts spending less time\nvideo gaming as a result of an intervention, this change in behavior is not going to spill over to\nhis friends because something else is driving the correlated effects in the first place.\nGiven these alternative interpretations of a significant peer effect, standard linear regression\nis unable to distinguish between the endogenous, the exogenous and the correlated effects and\na successful policy aimed at changing gaming behaviors will depend upon the mechanism driv-\ning peer effect in each particular case. If the purpose is devising an effective policy that would\nexploit behavioral influences among the peers, the econometric strategy needs to control for all\nother influences in order to identify the endogenous peer effect [53]. Our empirical strategy\ndeals with the reflection problem by relying on the instrumental variable approach, school\nfixed effects and by using exogenously assigned peer group.\nBecause approximately 18 percent of the students in our sample (1,449 observations) do not\nspend any time playing video games, the dependent variable (hours spent video gaming by a\nstudent) is left-censored at zero. In order to account for the censoring, we employ the Tobit\nregression model, which models the outcomes of the latent variable y\u00c3 related to the observed\nvalues of variable y as follows:\ny \u00bc\n(\ny\u00c3 if y\u00c3 > 0\n)\ny\u00c3\nijs\njs\nijs\ns\n\u00fe \nijs\nTable 1. (Continued)\nVariable Mean (SD)/Number (%)\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nIn this model, individual hours of video gaming by student i belonging to peer group j in\nschool s, y\u00c3\nijs\n, is a function of average number of hours of video gaming by the individual's\npeers, yjs\n. Xijs\nis a vector of personal and family demographic and socio-economic characteris-\ntics including a set of grade-level dummy variables. Ss\nis a vector of school indicator variables\n(school-level fixed effects), which are included in order to control for the confounding factors\nthat all students in the same school are exposed to. These could include any influences on\nvideo gaming at the level of school district (e.g. built school environment, availability of school\nclubs) as well as community-level environmental influences that might change the way stu-\ndents use their time (e.g., crime and poverty level in the neighborhood, presence of exercise\nfacilities). School and grade fixed effects also control for the correlated effects (including selec-\ntion via sorting into same grade and school) in the estimate of the peer effect. The endogenous\npeer effect, , captures peer effect on a student's time spent video gaming. If  is estimated to be\npositive, then policy intervention that alters video gaming behavior of an individual would\nhave an indirect effect on video gaming of other students in the same peer group [31].\nIf individual's behavior is a linear function of peer group average as in Eq 1, the parameter \nis not identified because group behavior is by definition the aggregation of individual behavior\n[31]. Therefore, in order to identify the direct effect of peers' behavior on the adolescent's\nbehavior, we utilize instrumental variable strategy. Instrumental variable approach is com-\nmonly used to identify peer effects in various health-related behaviors of adolescents\nwhere an endogeneity-correction term given by the least-squares residual from the first-stage\nmodel is added to the censored regression in Eq 1, and then Tobit regression is applied to the\nmodel with the correction term estimated jointly with the first-stage model [59].\nThe key to implementing the IV technique is having access to instrumental variables which\nsatisfy two properties. First, instruments must have a strong effect on the endogenous regres-\nsor, which in our case is peer measure of video gaming time. Second, instruments must have\nno effect on the outcome of interest, individual's gaming time, other than through their effect\non the peer measure. We use six variables that describe peers' relationship with their parents\nand the level of parental control over their activities: The percentage of peers whose parent (or\nguardian) (i) \"tries to control everything they do\", (ii)\"understands their problems\", (iii) \"helps\nthem as much as they need\", (iv) \"lets them make their own decisions\", (v) \"is loving\"; and (vi)\n\"treats them like a baby\". These peer level variables are expected to directly impact peers'\nbehavior but should otherwise not predict an individual's behavior. The intuition for the iden-\ntification using instruments is that, while individuals whose parents are more permissive or\nless involved are likely to spend more time playing video games, the parenting style of peer's\nparents will only affect the individual via peers. The use of instrumental variables in combina-\ntion with school-level fixed effects, exogenous peer group and important individual-level con-\ntrols would allow us to obtain more consistent estimates of the peer effects.\nResults\nWe begin by presenting Tobit regression estimates of the peer effects of video gaming time in\nTable 2, where the estimates are only adjusted for the effect of individual and family level\ncovariates (no school fixed effects or IV). The estimates are obtained for everyone, and then\nstratified by gender. (All of the Stata code used to create the variables for our analysis and to\nproduce the estimates in this paper are available from the authors upon request.)\nThe na\u00efve estimates in Table 2 show that there is a positive and statistically significant asso-\nciation between peers' and individual's video gaming time. Among included covariates, male\nstudents spend significantly more time video gaming compared to females. Students of black\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nor other race play significantly more compared to students of white race. Higher BMI, urban\nresidence, and number of computers at home are also associated with significantly higher time\nvideo gaming. On the other hand, better progress at school, positive attitude towards school,\nhaving a father or mother with a job, having a second home, being in the ninth or tenth grade\n(relative to the fifth grade) and having a helping parent are negatively associated with the time\nspent video gaming. After stratifying the estimates by gender, video gaming time among males\nis strongly associated with peers' video gaming time while the association for females is only\nmarginally statistically significant.\nTable 2.

All models include school fixed effects.\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nexcluded instruments is far greater than 10 in all cases, which indicates that our instruments\nare strong. The Amemiya-Lee-Newey overidentifying restrictions test fails to reject the null\nhypothesis that all of our instruments are exogenous (i.e. uncorrelated with the error term in\nthe Tobit regression) in all cases. These results support the validity of our instruments.\nAfter stratifying by gender, peer effect is statistically significant only for males and indicates\nthat an increase in the average amount of time playing video games among older grade-mates\nby an hour leads to .47 hours increase in video gaming by a male student. The peer effect for\nfemales is insignificant. These results are consistent with our second hypothesis and partially\nconsistent (for males) with our first hypothesis. In addition, we note that the magnitude of the\neffect is larger than the corresponding coefficient in Table 2. This indicates that after account-\ning for the reflection problem, peer effect becomes more important. The estimated peer effect\nfor the entire sample is not significant, which does not lend support to our first hypothesis,\nConclusion\nThe objective of this paper is to estimate peer effect in video gaming time among adolescents.\nWe use a nationally representative sample of the U.S. school-aged adolescents surveyed in\n2009\u00ad2010 to estimate a structural model that accounts for the potential biases in the estimate\nof the peer effect. Our results suggest that the amount of time spent video gaming by school\npeers significantly affects own time playing video games among male adolescents; an additional\none hour of playing video games per week by peers results in .47 hours increase in video gam-\ning time by male adolescent. We do not find significant peer effect among female adolescents.\nOur finding of a significant peer effect in video gaming among males is in line with the ear-\nlier research [29], which estimated peer effects in console use among secondary school students\naged 14\u00ad16 in Catalonia (Spain) using 2008 data. However, the magnitude of the peer effect\nfound in Spanish data is much lower than here; Spanish data [29] showed that an additional\nhour increase in console use by nominated friends within the classroom leads to an increase in\nindividual's gaming by only 5 minutes. Our finding of a significant peer effect is also broadly\nconsistent with the literature finding a significant peer effect in general screen time activities,\nwhich include video gaming among other media consumption [26,28].\nWhile our paper does not examine the reasons why there is a significant peer effect in video\ngaming time for males but not females, there are at least two possibilities for this gender differ-\nence. One possibility is that there are simply more opportunities for male gamers to interact\nand influence each other's gaming habits compared to female gamers, given that the research\nAnother possibility is that males and females have different motivations to play video games,\nwith males being more motivated by the opportunity to socialize (and hence influence and\nbeing influenced by peers) compared to females. This idea is supported by the finding that\nboys utilize violent or sports games as social tools that allow for socialization through competi-\ntion and cooperation [60]. Males also dominate LAN (Local Access Network) gaming events,\nwhere players bring their computers to a designated location to play online and face-to-face;\nand the main gratifying property of LAN events is the opportunity to game in each other's\npresence [61]. In addition, in a study of Matese men and women [36] found that \"males' pref-\nerence for first person shooters, roleplaying games, and sport and strategy games indicates grat-\nification of different needs\u00adchallenge and social interaction\" ([36], p. 36). On the other hand,\nwomen were found to be interested primarily in puzzle, adventure, fighting, and managerial\ngames, which indicates \"females' top reasons for playing include challenge and arousal\" ([36],\np. 36). Males have also been found to have a higher score on social interaction compared to\nfemales in explorative survey (N = 760) conducted among players of The Sims2 [62].\nDo Your School Mates Influence How Long You Game?\nAs with any empirical strategy, our results may only be viewed as suggesting a strong associ-\nation. Our study points in that direction provided that our assumptions hold. Specifically we\nassume that our instrumental variables, which reflect parental control over an adolescent's\nvideo-gaming, are plausibly uncorrelated with the video-gaming time of students who are in\nthe same grade. In addition, the data that we use and our estimates only suggest the existence\nof peer effects in video gaming time, but not the mechanism underlying the process (e.g., obser-\nvation of behavior vs. participation in behavior). Another limitation of our study is that it uses\nself-reported time spent playing video games. In fact, it has been found that gamers tend to\nunder-estimate the time they play [63,64]. As long the amount of underreporting of the gaming\ntime is unrelated to the regression error term, our estimates will be attenuated and will provide\na lower bound on the magnitude of the (positive) peer effects.\nOur findings imply that future policies aimed at changing video gaming behavior among\nadolescents could potentially benefit from relying on the spread of this behavior among peers,\nwhere even the individuals who did not directly participate or were not included in the pro-\ngram could nevertheless be affected by the program. Policies involving only a subset of the tar-\nget population would have a spillover effect on other individuals and may be more cost\neffective than previously thought.\nGiven that video gaming is a global phenomenon, future research could focus on cross-coun-\ntry comparisons to better understand the influence of cultural, ethnic, and other differences on\nthe magnitudes of peer effects in video gaming. It would also be valuable to learn about the mech-\nanisms through which peer effect in video gaming might operate by conducting qualitative analy-\nsis of players and by estimating peer effects for different types of games (multiplayer, LAN\ngames, on-line games). Future studies should also confirm whether the gender difference in the\npeer effect found here exists in other datasets and try to ascertain the reasons behind it.\nAuthor Contributions\nAnalyzed the data: AA AK.\nWrote the paper: AA AK.\nReferences\nGames. http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/video-\n2.
