    "abstract": "Abstract\nSecondary analysis of qualitative data entails reusing data created from previous research projects for new purposes. Reuse\nprovides an opportunity to study the raw materials of past research projects to gain methodological and substantive insights.\nIn the past decade, use of the approach has grown rapidly in the United Kingdom to become sufficiently accepted that it\nmust now be regarded as mainstream. Several factors explain this growth: the open data movement, research funders' and\npublishers' policies supporting data sharing, and researchers seeing benefits from sharing resources, including data. Another\nfactor enabling qualitative data reuse has been improved services and infrastructure that facilitate access to thousands of\ndata collections. The UK Data Service is an example of a well-established facility; more recent has been the proliferation of\nrepositories being established within universities. This article will provide evidence of the growth of data reuse in the United\nKingdom and in Finland by presenting both data and case studies of reuse that illustrate the breadth and diversity of this\nmaturing research method. We use two distinct data sources that quantify the scale, types, and trends of reuse of qualitative\ndata: (a) downloads of archived data collections held at data repositories and (b) publication citations. Although the focus of\nthis article is on the United Kingdom, some discussion of the international environment is provided, together with data and\nexamples of reuse at the Finnish Social Science Data Archive. The conclusion summarizes the major findings, including some\nconjectures regarding what makes qualitative data attractive for reuse and sharing.\n",

Qualidata paved the way for others, eventually inte-\ngrating with the UK Data Archive (UKDA), part of the larger\nUK Data Service, which now disseminates nearly 1,000\nqualitative and mixed-methods data sets, more than half of\nwhich are available through the Service's more recently\nestablished self-archiving system, ReShare (reshare.ukdatas-\nervice.ac.uk).\nThe period from 2000 has seen a boom in both the drivers\nof data sharing and the development of human and material\ncapability to do so. Research funders are increasingly man-\ndating easy or open access to research data and data manage-\nment plans to ensure maximum quality, sustainability,\naccessibility, and openness of research data. Publishers of\nacademic findings demand that the supporting data can be\naccessed for scrutiny or further exploration. Governments\ninternationally are demanding transparency in research, and\nthe economic climate makes it desirable for much greater\nreuse of data to maximize the return on science investments\n(Corti, Van den Eynden, Bishop, & Woollard, 2014).\nIn parallel with the promotion of, and support for data\nsharing, there are also indicators of growing acceptance of\nsecondary analysis of qualitative data as a recognized meth-\nodology. The UK National Centre for Research Methods\npublishes a vocabulary of categories of research methods in\nthe social sciences. First published in 2004, it listed the term\n\"secondary analysis\" with no sub-categories (Beissel-\nhad numerous sub-classifications: archival research, docu-\nmentary research, analysis of official statistics, analysis of\nexisting survey data, analysis of administrative data, and last\n(but surely with no imputation of being least) analysis of sec-\nondary qualitative data (Luff, Byatt, & Martin, 2015).\nThe methodology is also appearing more frequently in\nmethods textbooks.

The final sections of the article\ndiscuss recent case studies of research using secondary anal-\nysis. We conclude that, despite some limitations on the avail-\nable evidence, there are strong indications of growing reuse\nof data.\nA Brief History of Data Sharing:\nPolicies and Infrastructure\nThe development of policies and infrastructure to support the\nreuse of qualitative data has gone hand-in-hand with the\ndevelopment of an ethos of data sharing; both are necessary\nif data are to be made available for sharing and valued as a\nresource for reuse.\nPolicies\nThe process of enabling data sharing has developed in a wide\nvariety of ways when viewed comparatively across Europe.\nThis was shown clearly by Ruusalepp (2008) who compre-\nhensively reviewed developments across the 30 countries of\ntheOrganisationforEconomicCooperationandDevelopment\n(OECD). He showed that organizations such as the OECD,\nUNESCO, European Strategy Forum on Research\nInfrastructures (ESFRI), and The Committee on Data for\nScience and Technology (CODATA) had policies that pro-\nmoted or recommended data sharing, and that these policies\ninfluenced the development of numerous UK organizations\n(e.g., Office of Science and Innovation [e-Infrastructure],\nNetwork's Strategic Plan). These policies stopped short of\nrecommending mandatory data sharing.\nTo date, there are no unified national policies across the\ncountries of the OECD that mandate data sharing in this way,\nalthough there is an increase in requirements for \"data man-\nagement plans,\" which ask researchers to take into account\ndata sharing and curation, most notably in 2011 by the\nResearch Councils UK and by the National Science\nFoundation in the United States. The European Commission\nHorizon 2020 program of funding ran a pilot project requir-\ning data management plans to be submitted alongside\napplications (European Commission, 2013). The ethos of\ndata sharing is strongly endorsed within these policies and is\nbeginning to have a discernible impact at the organizational\nlevel.\nDating back to the 1970s, the United Kingdom's Economic\nand Social Research Council or its predecessor has had a\nresearch data policy that has required all award holders to\noffer their quantitative data to be formally archived. In 1995,\nqualitative data were added to this mandate, and similar obli-\nand Social Research Council, 2015b). The Council's recently\nrevised Framework for Research Ethics notes that ethical\nconsiderations apply to data archiving, sharing, linking, and\nreuse, as well as data collection and research publication\n(Economic and Social Research Council, 2015a).\nAlthough other public research funders have published\nsimilar policies, a milestone was the adoption of the Common\nPrinciples on Data Policy adopted by all research councils in\nAccess to Research Outputs (Research Councils UK, 2012)\nrequired funded peer-reviewed research papers to be pub-\nlished in journals that are compliant with the Policy on Open\nAccess, and to include a statement on how the underlying\nresearch materials such as data, samples, or models can be\naccessed. Across UK higher education institutions, 55% of\nresearch is funded by the research councils, an annual invest-\nment of about \u00a33 billion, and thus such policies strongly\ninfluence research practices (Higher Education Statistics\nData Sharing Infrastructure\nA further important influence on data sharing has been the\nwillingness of UK funders to underwrite projects that are\nfully or partially engaged in making data available for shar-\ning. In the realm of infrastructure for qualitative data, these\ninclude continuing support for the UK Data Service, includ-\ning bringing in enhanced user services such as QualiBank, a\nsystem for online searching and browsing of qualitative data\n(UK Data Service, 2013), and funding for a major qualitative\nlongitudinal data repository as part of the Timescapes proj-\nect, housed at the University of Leeds (Timescapes\nRepository, 2015). And, around the world, national funding\nagencies have begun to support national pilots for qualitative\ndata sharing. However, investment is typically cautious and\nfor fixed periods of time, thus making the long-term sustain-\nability of an archive somewhat precarious.\nAs recently as 2011, Corti reported that only two European\ncountries, that are part of the broader Council of European\nSocial Science Data Archives (CESSDA), the United\nKingdom and Finland, had \"mature infrastructures\" for qual-\nitative data sharing. Since then, there has been progress with\nseveral other European archives that were initially estab-\nlished for quantitative data now accepting qualitative data as\nwell (e.g.,Swiss Foundation for Research in Social Sciences\nBishop and Kuula-Lummi 3\n[FORS], GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in\nGermany, Norwegian Centre for Research Data [NSD], and\nSocial Science DataArchives [ADP] in Slovenia). Elsewhere\nin Europe, specialist research centers are storing and making\ntheir data collections available. QualiService, at the\nUniversity of Bremen, focuses on life course interviews and\nmethods and has short-term support from the central German\nresearch funder, DFG (QualiService, 2016). A new facility in\nPoland, the Archives of Qualitative Data at the Institute of\nPhilosophy and Sociology in the PolishAcademy of Sciences,\nopened in 2013. Other successful infrastructure develop-\nments include the integration of the Irish Qualitative Data\nArchive into the national Digital Repository of Ireland, hous-\ning a whole spectrum of social and cultural Irish data. Neale\nplay of a selection of European qualitative archives as they\nDevelopments extend beyond Europe as well. In the\nUnited States, the long-standing Henry A. Murray Centre,\nwhich holds data on the life course, is housed at Harvard\nUniversity. A newly founded Qualitative Data Repository,\nsupported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), is\nhosted by the Center for Qualitative and Multi-Method\nInquiry, a unit of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and\nPublic Affairs at Syracuse University. The repository's initial\nemphasis is on political science, but it already has plans to\ncover social sciences more broadly (Qualitative Data\nRepository, 2015). In Australia, Research Data Australia\nholds a small but growing number of qualitative data sets,\nand the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social\nResearch data archive at the University of Michigan has\nrecently begun holding some qualitative data as well.\nScale of Collections\nThe UK Data Service currently holds nearly 1,000 qualita-\ntive and mixed-methods collections that are accessible from\nthe catalogue (UK Data Service, 2016). The Finnish Social\nScience DataArchive (FSD) began archiving qualitative data\nqualitative data sets have been deposited. A new longitudinal\nFinnish project will collect data from 100 young people over\nthe next 10 years. Inspired by the Timescapes Project, the\nFinnish researchers aim to conduct their project in close\ncooperation with Timescapes and to deposit all the data col-\nlected during the project.\nIn other cases, however, the amounts of data being han-\ndled within the archives are typically quite small, some\ndozens of collections at the most, and the staff time avail-\nable for the processing of qualitative data is often limited.\nIn Germany, GESIS, which curates predominantly quanti-\ntative data, also holds 64 qualitative collections.\nQualiService, the repository for life course research\nlocated in Bremen, holds 14 collections, but each one is\nlarge, with the total number of interviews greater than\n1,730. The social science data archives in Switzerland and\nSlovenia each holds fewer than 10 qualitative and mixed\ncollections, although, again, a single collection may con-\ntain up to 200 qualitative interviews.\nThis summary of the current situation for data sharing\npolicies and infrastructures is, inevitably, partial. There are\ninitiatives in many other countries, albeit these are typically\nsmall-scale and very modestly funded. Although the changes\nmay not be happening with blinding speed, there does seem\nto be a reasonable pace of steady growth.\nMeasuring Reuse of Data\nIt can be challenging to quantify and measure the reuse of\ndata, but there have been many recent advances, partly driven\nby funders' requirements to measure impact from research.\nBall and Duke (2015) discuss many recent innovations in\nmeasuring data use as part of the effort to measure research\nimpact. Metrics currently in use include citations of specific\ndata collections, resolutions to a unique persistent identifier\n(such as a Digital Object Identifier, or DOI), page views of a\nweb site where a data catalogue record is rendered, and\ndownloads of the data (the user transfers a copy of the data\nset from a repository to another location). Additional explor-\natory measures are being used, such as tracking mentions on\nsocial media. Commercial metrics services are proliferating\nin this area as well, the best known being the Thomson\u00ad\nReuters Data Citation Index, which displays the number of\ntimes a data set has been cited in the Web of Science.\nBall and Duke acknowledge limitations of such efforts:\nSome measurements are very noisy, duplications are not\nalways controlled, and--as with almost any metric--the sys-\ntem can be gamed. This applies equally when attempting to\nmeasure use of qualitative data. At the UK Data Service, all\nusers are asked to fully cite data they use in any publications,\nand every data collection record contains a block of citation\ntext, ready to copy and paste, including a DOI. However, in\npractice, many authors use partial or non-standard citations,\nor worse, fail to cite data at all. As a result, it remains a costly\nmanual process to obtain detailed information about reuse. In\ntime, encouragement to cite data using DOIs that can be eas-\nily found through a web search will help automate some of\nthis counting work (Farquhar & Brase, 2014).\nIn this article, we use two distinct data sources that quan-\ntify the scale, types, and trends of reuse of qualitative data:\n(a) downloads of data collections held at two data reposito-\nries and (b) publication citations. The first measure is the\nfrequency and nature of downloads of qualitative data from\nthe UK Data Service and FSD, and the second is citations of\npublications that have used or discussed secondary analysis\nof qualitative data. Although these sources have their limita-\ntions, each one provides new and useful knowledge about the\nreuse of qualitative data, particularly in light of the dearth of\nempirical information and the measurement difficulties iden-\ntified above.\n4 SAGE Open\nMeasuring Data Reuse Using Information From\nData Downloads\nUK Data Service. The source of data for this research was\nbased on information collected by the UK Data Service\nwhenever a data collection from the main curated collec-\ntion is downloaded. (This analysis updates and improves a\nprevious study of similar data conducted in 2014 [Bishop,\n2014].) We began by establishing the number of data col-\nlections for which information on access was available.\nCollections categorized as either qualitative or mixed were\ncurated collections in scope, which excludes more than\nvia the ReShare self-deposit system. Of these 444, 40%\n(177) have never been downloaded. In a few cases, data\nwere not accessible to users for reasons of embargo or\nbecause data had been withdrawn, but most collections\nwere available but had just not been accessed. The remain-\ning 60% (267) had been downloaded at least once, and\nthese 267 collections are the source for the following\nanalysis.\nAfter establishing the number of collections, we then\nhad to define and count \"unique downloads\" of each col-\nlection. Uniqueness in this case is defined as a specific\nuser accessing data for a specific preregistered project. The\nsample that we investigated is based on 7,155 unique\ndownloads of 267 possible data collections. For each\ndownload, additional information was available from\ndetails that users provide when they register with the UK\nData Service: user affiliation, user discipline, and a brief\n(30-word minimum) description of the specific project for\nwhich the data were downloaded. When data are provided\nas open access with no user registration required, then\nmeasurement of a download is no longer possible in this\nmanner. However, prior to 2013, almost no qualitative col-\nlections were available as open data.\nThe maximum number of times a single collection was\nis thus the case that a modest proportion of collections\nreceived the heaviest usage; similar usage patterns have been\nfound for use of quantitative data at the UK Data Service.\nFigure 1 presents the breakdown of who uses data.\nOverall, 42% of the downloads were by postgraduate stu-\ndents, 25% by undergraduates, and 27% by staff members at\ninstitutions of higher education. The remaining 6% com-\nprised other staff, other students, people using data for per-\nsonal or genealogical research, and commercial users.\nNext, the reuse projects were classified into several broad\ncategories of depending on the purposes for which the data\nwere being used: research, teaching, and learning. To qualify\nas research, the project description had to include sufficient\ndetail to suggest a plausible research project. PhD projects\nwere automatically included in research unless the descrip-\ntion specified that the data were being used only for explor-\natory purposes, that is, for learning. \"Learning\" projects\ntypically mentioned that the data were being used to com-\nplete an assignment; all master's and undergraduate projects\nwere classified as learning. A project was categorized as\nteaching if that purpose was mentioned. The majority of the\nteaching projects involved the teaching of qualitative\nresearch methods. In the cases where we were not able to\ndifferentiate, we used the category Teaching/Learning and\nassigned the category partly based on the type of user (edu-\ncational staff or student).\nused for research, 13% (957) for teaching, and the significant\nwere either miscellaneous uses or unclassifiable due to insuf-\nficient information in the project descriptions.\nIn addition to the broad pattern of teaching and learning\nuse, we are also able to say a bit more about the breakdown\nbetween undergraduates and postgraduates within each group\n(see Tables 2 and 3). For teaching, the share of postgraduate-\nlevel teaching was somewhat higher than for undergraduate\nteaching (32% vs. 23%). Nearly half of the observations\ncould not be classified into either category. However, for\nlearning, a quite substantial majority (58%) were postgradu-\nates compared with 39% of the learning uses reported by\nundergraduates. Given that much of the teaching use was for\ncourses in research methods, and these are more common at\nthe postgraduate level, this finding is not surprising, but does\nadd useful detail as well as suggest possible opportunities to\nexpand the reuse of data for undergraduate teaching.\nFor any archive, it is important to understand what it is that\nmakes a collection a good candidate for reuse. This study\nlooked for patterns in the characteristics of the collections that\nare being reused most often. The list of most used collections\nTable 1.

Teaching Use--Breakdown by Undergraduates and\nPostgraduates.\nTeaching category\nNumber of\ndownloads %\n6 SAGE Open\n(see Table 4) is highly varied, making patterns hard to ascer-\ntain, but some features clearly stood out. Mixed-methods col-\nlections and collections with multiple types of data are used,\nperhaps because of the convenience of learning about several\ngenres of data within one study. Topics tended to be current\nand to be relevant for policy debates, for example, crime, gen-\nder, social exclusion, and food. In addition, some collections\nnot in the top five but still highly ranked might be seen to\nappeal to a younger generation of students: youth into adult\ntransitions, youth crime, and cannabis use. However, in addi-\ntion to specific focused studies, oral histories covering a\nbreadth of topics are also used heavily.\nWe believe the key finding from this research is the scale\nand significance of the reuse of data for teaching and learn-\ning. Although there is sometimes a tendency to privilege data\nreuse for research, the widespread use across several levels\nof education is clearly enriching teaching by the use of real\ndata. This is certainly consistent with recommendations from\nseveral higher education authorities regarding the impor-\ntance and value to learners of research-led teaching (Blair,\n2015). In some project descriptions, methods teachers noted\nthat their students learned qualitative methods best if they\nwere able to use actual data that matched their interests. In\nher project description, one instructor wrote, \"Real interview\ndata is effective in engaging student interest.\" It would seem\nthat being engaged with the specific topics the data describe\nis more effective at motivating students to learn methodol-\nogy than working with generic or artificial data. Our analysis\nrevealed another finding: Active promotion of a study, by\neither a particular faculty member or by the UK Data Service,\ndramatically increases the use of its data. We can see this\neffect when teachers repeatedly assign students to use data\nthey have generated for teaching, which we know has hap-\npened for several of the most frequently used collections,\nnotably the highest ranked collection on gender and crime\nTeachers, especially recent PhDs, have the benefit of\nexpertise in their subject area, but often, they will not have\nhad the time or opportunity to build a broad repertoire of\nmaterials with which they are well acquainted and make\nthem available for teaching. Archives are perfectly suited to\nfilling that gap. (See Haaker & Morgan Brett, 2016, in this\nissue, for a more extensive treatment of reusing data for\nteaching.) This is a need that data centers are ideally posi-\ntioned to meet. Archives can offer a wide range of types of\ndata from diverse methods of qualitative research. In addi-\ntion, archives are able to promote their distinctive holdings\nthrough teaching resources.\nThe challenge in developing appealing teaching\nresources is, as always, the time, effort, and cost to pro-\nduce them. However, even smaller data centers have used\nthis strategy successfully, and often, a strategy of co-pro-\nduction with data creators can be deployed. The Irish\nQualitative Data Archive (2015) produced a series of\nlearning resources based on archived data from the Life\nHistories and Social Change Project. The resources consist\nof guided introductions to key sociological concepts, such\nas social class, using audio and text extracts from life his-\ntory interviews. In a second example, Mass Observation is\na key historical resource of popular accounts of everyday\nlife in the United Kingdom produced by a panel of record-\ners who respond to thematic directives (e.g., life under aus-\nterity). A variety of learning activities are supported, for\nexample, English teachers in higher and further education\nuse its resources for inspiration for creative writing or per-\nformance (Mass Observation Archive, 2015). All these\nexamples demonstrate that providing archived data to\nteachers enables innovations in substantive and methods\ninstruction. Although requiring an investment, there are\ntwo obvious benefits for archives: Usage numbers for the\npromoted data will rise, and a next generation of research-\ners will learn to see reuse of qualitative data as a routine\nand normal part of their methods training. This would be a\nsignificant accomplishment.\nFinnish Data Service. The FDS is usefully compared with the\nUK Data Service because it has held qualitative data for\nmore than a decade and collects similar usage statistics.\nqualitative data sets annually from FSD, and after launching\nthe online data service \"Aila\" in mid-2014, the number of\nreusers of qualitative data sets increased (Finnish Social Sci-\nloads of qualitative data sets, and over the 18 months period\nsince the launch, 550 unique reuse projects were identified:\nshown in Figure 3. The categories used are somewhat differ-\nent from those used by the UK Data Service; however, the\npattern of a significant majority of reuse for teaching and\nlearning holds in both countries. The higher figure for\nTable 4.

Finnish methods teachers usually want to demonstrate\ndifferent kinds of analytical methods and a variety of research\nquestions to students by using a single data collection, with\nteachers themselves often selecting a sample from an\narchived data set. Students using the data archive's resources\noften write their masters theses based solely on archived\nqualitative data sets. Compared with collecting their own\ndata for the theses, using archived data has the advantage of\nallowing students to spend significantly more time on think-\ning, analysis, and interpretation rather than on data collection\nMeasuring Trends in Data Reuse\nHaving looked at the overall picture of qualitative data reuse\nby purpose and user type, with comparative data from the\nUnited Kingdom and Finland, we next investigated the pat-\ntern of data reuse over time. In this section, two data sources\nare presented: the UK Data Service downloads analyzed\nabove, and data from a citation search on Web of Science.\nIn Figure 4, we show the number of qualitative and mixed\ndata downloads from the UK Data Service per year from\nincrease, rising to a peak of just more than 900 downloads in\n2011. This is followed by a decline, then leveling out at about\n2016 is the extrapolation if the rate for the first 2 months of\nthe year continues. We do not know of any factors that would\nhave contributed to the peak in 2011, but the overall pattern\nis broadly consistent with the use of all data types from the\nUK Data Service (Economic and Social Research Council,\nThe second measure of reuse over time used in this arti-\ncle involved a web-based search for articles that had reused\nqualitative data in their analyses or discussed the technique.\nThe Thomson\u00adReuters Web of Science (webofknowledge.\ncom) citation metrics portal was used to extract information,\nsearch criteria that would return articles that had reused\nqualitative data, specifying either of the two phrases: \"quali-\ntative research\" or \"qualitative study(ies).\" A second com-\nponent was added using the AND Boolean using \"secondary\nanalysis\" or \"reuse\" as both terms are applied to repurposing\nof data. We placed no restrictions on the disciplines of the\npublications.\nThis method has significant limitations. Other genres of\nqualitative research, such as ethnography, content analysis, and\ncase studies, all could have involved secondary analysis with-\nout containing any of the keywords we chose. However, to use\nadditional keywords would have required far more extensive\ncontent analysis of each article, which we were not in a position\nto undertake.Also, we were not able to be certain if each article\nused the method, although a review of abstracts and selected\ncontent indicated that most did. This analysis, then, may\nPurpose of reuse\nStudying\nMaster theses\nTeaching\nResearch\nFigure 3.

The number\nbeen somewhat uneven, with fluctuations in several years.\nA similar, but more narrowly circumscribed, search was\nconducted by Yardley, Watts, Pearson, and Richardson\n(2014). They searched for all articles that mentioned use of\nsecondary analysis of qualitative data with a focus on ethi-\ncal issues, especially consent, over the period 1994 to\n2010. Their goal was to \"identify and critique the `state of\nthe science' related to secondary analysis with particular\nfocus on issues of consent\" (p. 104). The search terms they\nused were \"qualitative and ethics\" and \"consent and sec-\nondary analysis.\" Using these more restrictive criteria,\nthey found 154 references.

Significantly, the majority of the data collections have\nbeen used at least once. The concern that vast quantities of\ndata are being archived but never touched is demonstrably\nnot the case. And it is clear in both the United Kingdom and\nFinland that the main purposes are for education: Students\nand staff in educational institutions make up most users, and\nlearning is nearly twice as frequent as all other uses com-\nbined in the United Kingdom. In terms of understanding\ntrends of reuse over time, the evidence suggests a fairly rapid\nrate of growth in early years. This is not surprising, given the\nlow initial base. The most recent data have suggested the\ngrowth may have stabilized, but it is not possible to tell\nwhether the previously rapid growth will resume.\nTo our knowledge, this is the most robust and detailed\ndata available on the actual practices of reusing qualitative\ndata. That said, these data have significant limitations and\nthe inferences need to be modest. We know we are over-\ncounting usage of qualitative data by including mixed-meth-\nods studies. However, there is also substantial undercounting\nas these data did not include usages from the UK Data\nService self-archiving system, ReShare, which hosts more\nthan 500 collections of qualitative data (excluded for reasons\nof not being able to obtain comparable metrics at this time).\nIt is also the case that high variability of the descriptions\nreusers is a constraint. There is an inevitable tension at work:\nDemanding more information from reusers would certainly\nreduce actual reuse, but minimal information limits the\npotential scope of any analysis. Improved integration in\ninternal systems at the UK Data Service may be able to\naddress some of these issues.\nLater in this article, we will return to the question of what\nseems to make some topics and disciplines more inclined to\nuse secondary analysis of qualitative data.\nDiverse Approaches to Reusing\nQualitative Data for Research\nThe first half of this article has addressed the following ques-\ntions: How often are archived qualitative data reused, for\nwhat purposes, and by whom? In the second half, we look in\nmore detail at how have data been reused in several research\nprojects and consider these usages in light of the debate\nabout the role of context when reusing qualitative data. This\nassessment also contributes some better understanding of\nwhat makes a data collection a good candidate for reuse.\nThe examples of reuse presented below have been selected\nto capture the variety of research using secondary analysis of\nqualitative data across dimensions of method, subject, data\nsources, and the connections, if any, between primary and\nsecondary researchers. Another dimension of interest is the\nextent to which the reuse project drew upon extensive con-\ntext of the primary research project.At the time when reusing\ndata was less common, this \"context debate\" was quite pro-\nnounced, and has been usefully summarized by Hammersley\n(2010). In this section, we hope to advance the debate beyond\nwhat has been, at times, often speculative discussion by\nlooking at actual research practice and the role context has\nplayed in successful research projects that have reused quali-\ntative data.\nTen years ago, Jennifer Mason (2007) had already observed\nthe progress made when researchers moved beyond overly\nmoralist debates about reuse to \"get on and do it\" (par.1.3).\nThe diversity and quality of these cases suggest that, over the\npast decade, researchers have continued to do just that.\nMoreover, these cases demonstrate that a kind of pluralism of\napproaches to secondary analysis has emerged and expanded.\nFor some approaches, deep knowledge of the original context\nis highly beneficial, perhaps even essential. In others, usage\nof data seems to proceed with equally good outcomes with\nlittle need for it.\nBefore turning in more detail to several UK cases, it is\nhelpful to consider the rather different environment for data\nsharing that exists in Finland. There are valuable insights\nfrom recent evidence from Finnish users as to how much\ncontext they actually require to proceed with analyzing\nanother's data. The non-binding policy and funding frame-\nwork in Finland, which recommends archiving data rather\nthan requiring it, has framed the FSD's expectations of\ndepositors regarding what they need to do as part of their\ndata sharing activities. FSD has fairly modest expectations\nfor depositors because it was felt that demanding compre-\nhensive descriptions of the methodology and analyses used\nin primary research would have decreased the willingness of\nresearchers to archive their data and resulted in far less data\nbeing made available. Instead, archivists have been able to\nreassure researchers that the workload required by the\narchiving process will not be onerous.\nAs a result, the FSD focuses on ensuring that the data are\nfully documented, but do not seek extensive documentation\nof the primary project. In practice, this means providing\ninformation about fieldwork and data collection methods\n(e.g., questionnaire, interview instructions, sample design)\ntogether with background information about participants for\neach data file (e.g., an interview), but little or no detail about\nthe primary project itself, why it was done, and so on. This\nlevel of documentation seems to be sufficient for many users'\nrequirements, as most of them do not seem to have an inter-\nest in replicating the original research. For teaching research\nmethods, samples of qualitative data sets are used in Finland\nmuch more often than whole data sets.And for more substan-\ntive research, archived qualitative data are often used to sup-\nplement the researcher's own data or intended data. This type\nof reuse is demonstrated in the query below from a Finnish\nresearcher seeking data:\nI am writing a research plan. My research concentrates on the\nmeaningful life and happiness of elderly women living alone. To\nget new ideas and insights, I would like to order any interviews\nof women aged 70 and over living alone. The topics of the\ninterviews are irrelevant.\nThis is, we suggest, a pragmatic approach that acknowledges\nthe need to balance burdens on depositors with demands for\nexhaustive details of their primary research with making\nmore research data available in a timely manner.\nThe cases of reuse below, then, present a range of genres\nof reuse. Some of the examples presented tend toward the\n\"context-rich\" end of the continuum, with the secondary\nresearchers availing themselves of detailed knowledge of the\noriginal data and project as well. However, other examples\nshow that even when relatively little contextual information\nis available, secondary analysis can proceed with positive\nresults. To be absolutely clear, we do not want to overly\nexaggerate this point--these cases vary on many dimen-\nsions, not only context. And we would still encourage depos-\nitors to include rich project descriptions, and those reusing\ndata to make use of any available materials. Our point is that\nsecondary analysis is, or should be, a broad church, and these\ncases are useful for moving beyond abstract debate by show-\ncasing actual secondary research projects that can be assessed\non their own merits.\nConnecting Qualitative and Quantitative Data\nA number of qualitative reuse projects have drawn upon\nrelated quantitative data. The studies below demonstrate dif-\nferent approaches to connecting qualitative secondary analysis\nwith survey data. Jane Gray's (2014) research examined chil-\ndren in rural Irish communities during the first half of the 20th\ncentury. Children's movement to and from school, and to non-\nparental residences, was investigated using the Life Histories\nand Social Change database held at the Irish Qualitative Data\nArchive, which comprises 113 life stories, sampled from par-\nticipants in the nationally representative survey, Living in\nIreland. Because the interviews were selected from this larger,\nquantitative survey, it permitted robust sampling by age (three\ncohorts) and geography (urban/rural). Moreover, the in-depth\nqualitative data made it possible to probe previous research\nthemes that claimed to have found evidence of \"rural decay\"\nwith young people leaving the countryside (Brody 1973). By\ndrawing upon the qualitative interview data, Gray found more\nand stronger interconnections between households centered\non children. These ties worked to strengthen extended families\nand promote social mobility of young people, moderating ear-\nlier findings of rural decay.\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, Sarah Irwin (2011)\nworked across qualitative and quantitative data by drawing\non data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in\nEngland and the Young Lives and Times study, qualitative\nlongitudinal data that are part of the Timescapes Study, to\naddress both methodological and substantive research ques-\ntions. She used qualitative interview data to inform the\ndesign of Young Lives and Times survey questions, and find-\nings from the Longitudinal Study ofYoung People in England\nhelped to shape interview questions asked in later phases of\nqualitative longitudinal work. Finally, she situated partici-\npants in the qualitative sample in relation to characteristics of\nthe nationally representative sample. These strategies have\nbeen highly successful in combining qualitative depth with\nquantitative breadth.\nHealth\nBroad topics with general appeal seem open to secondary\nresearch; the field of health is an especially fertile domain.\nAn exemplary project was done by Stajduhar, Martin, and\nCairns (2010) on bereaved family caregivers and health care\nproviders supporting cancer patients. They reused data taken\nfrom a larger mixed-methods study and conducted second-\nary analysis on the focus group data: three with bereaved\nfamily caregivers, and two with health professionals. One\nauthor had been involved with collecting the original data,\nbut the team also included new investigators who had not\nbeen involved in the primary project. The team of secondary\nresearchers addressed new research questions, quite differ-\nent from those of the original study. Existing data were used\nto identify factors that made grieving difficult for carers, for\nexample, carers may conceal the emotional toll of caregiv-\ning, and after a patient's death, and they lack the ability to\nsustain social networks that could be supportive. The\nresearch also revealed an ambivalent role for paid employ-\nment for carers: It could provide some support and structure,\nbut often, the stress of work simply compounded the burden\nof caring responsibilities. Another study on bereavement by\nRibbens McCarthy (2006) drew on many sources such as\nhistorical literature and also reused data from the Inventing\nAdulthoods data collection (Henderson, Holland, Thomson,\nOne factor accounting for the abundance of secondary\nanalysis research in health is the availability of data. The\nHealth Experiences Research Group (2014) is located in the\nPrimary Care Health Sciences at University of Oxford and has\namassed one of the largest and best known repositories of\nqualitative data about medical conditions at healthtalk.org. It\nwas established to conduct multi-disciplinary research on\nhealth experiences and has compiled interviews with more\nhealth-related issues. These data are being reused extensively.\nBishop and Kuula-Lummi 11\nThe substantial collection of data and the extensive net-\nwork of interested researchers have yielded diverse\napproaches for primary and secondary analysts to work\ntogether. For example, in Locock and Brown's (2010) work\non attitudes about support in motor neuron disease, the two\nresearchers pooled their data, in effect, both becoming sec-\nondary analysts of each other's data. Their method also\nincluded joint development of coding categories for thematic\nanalysis. Ryan and Ziebland (2015) used data selected from\nthe collection to study the role of pets in peoples'experiences\nof chronic illness, but neither had been involved in conduct-\ning the original interviews. Not only has this significant\nrepository supported diverse forms of collaboration, it has\nalso produced both theoretical and applied outputs. Published\narticles cover a wide range of subjects and have appeared in\ncore medical journals, and other outputs and reports have\nhad direct policy relevance, such as improving understand-\ning of how people use the experiences of others to make their\nown medical decisions and advice on end-of-life decision\nFood\nFood research is also well represented in qualitative secondary\nanalysis.Knight,Brannen,andO'Connell(2015)studiedfoodand\ndomestic life in England during 1950 by analyzing three diaries\nwritten for the Mass Observation Archive. These narrative archi-\nval sources offered a methodological alternative to traditional\nresearch formats, such as interviews. In their case, the nature of\ndiaries offered not a \"second-best\" data source, but possibly one\npreferable to direct interviews. The subject of food is sufficiently\nmorally freighted that direct questions often elicit normatively cor-\nrect answers: \"of course I eat five a day.\" It was thought the more\npersonal reflective diary format might reveal more authentic prac-\ntices. In addition, the Mass Observation Archive provided an\nample supply of diaries from which to sample.\nWe decided to focus on the year 1950, for a number of reasons:\nfirst, material from Mass Observation during the period of the\nSecond World War had already been extensively studied by\nother researchers but the post-war period less so. Second, the\nyear 1950 was a particularly difficult time for ordinary people\nwith rising prices, including food, and the continuation of\nrationing. Third, the Mass Observation Archive includes\ndirectives from 1950, in which correspondents were asked for\ntheir views on topics relevant to food, for example, on standards\nof living, food costs, attitudes to continuing rationing and\nhousework tasks. We thought that this information could\nusefully supplement and facilitate contextualisation of the diary\nFamily Practices\nThe particular suitability of existing data is also a feature of\nresearch on family practices. As with food, everyday family\npractices can go unremarked, and are often not recalled\nbecause they are--consciously or not--regarded as insignifi-\ncant. Phoenix and Brannen (2014) each revisited their own\ndata that had originally been collected for different purposes.\nThey then collaborated to use the narrative data that had been\nproduced in the original projects to investigate family expe-\nriences of fatherhood and of children as language brokers for\ntheir families.\nMotherhood as well as fatherhood has proved a rich object\nfor reuse studies. In Thomson, Moe, Thorne, and Bjerrum-\nNielsen (2012), the original empirical materials were pro-\nduced in an earlier study about motherhood. A researcher\nmade weekly visits to observe interactions between one\nyoung mother and her baby, with highly detailed notes made\nafter each visit, ranging from bodily movements and vocal-\nizations to notes about the home environment. More than\nfive years later, a new team assembled, including the original\nobserver and others from the primary team, with several new\nresearchers to embark on an intensive study of this single\ncase using psycho-social techniques of close reading of these\ntexts. In intensive group sessions, which included reading\nthe original notes aloud, the team concurred that key pas-\nsages conveyed strong affect (e.g., the baby described as\nvery \"demanding\" about feeding), and these corresponded\nwith passages that had been noted by the original observers,\nsuggesting that even something as subtle as \"affect\" can be\ncaptured in transcribed notes. The highly detailed original\nobservational notes, the presence of the original observer in\nthe new team, and the psycho-social method that focused on\nboth manifest and latent meanings in the data as well as the\n(relatively) slow pace of the reanalysis all combined to help\nmitigate one of the most frequent criticisms of secondary\nanalysis: absence of the context of the original study.\nIn a final example, Meg Wiggins followed up with some of\nthe mothers from Ann Oakley's (1979) Becoming a Mother\nproject to interview them about their reflections on mother-\nhood 35 years after they had given birth. It is a methodologi-\ncally impressive project, both for successfully locating the\nmothers after so long a time period and the innovative blend-\ning of expertise, with Oakley assisting in the research, and\nWiggins in the leading role in the secondary project. Wiggins\nwas able to secure consent from many participants and suc-\ncessfully archived interviews from the follow-up study\nAt the UK Data Service, the largest qualitative data set,\nalmost 500 long interview transcripts and audio from the study,\nknown as The Edwardians have been available to users since\n2009). The study is unique, not only as it enabled Thompson to\npioneer his Life History method, but also in its extensive cover-\nage of content providing researchers with a wide range of topics\nto investigate about working class life in the Edwardian period:\nissues on domestic routine, household roles, meals, the upbring-\ning of children, emotional relationships and values in the family,\nleisure, religion, politics, school, courtship and marriage,\nextended family, relationships with neighbors, experience of\nwork, and occupational history of the whole family. The avail-\nable data have resulted in hundreds of reuse publications written\npredominantly by social historians and sociologists.\nWork\nSometimes, the discovery of data from an earlier research\nstudy borders on the marvelous. In 2000, data from a study\nabout young workers in Leicester conducted by Norbert\nElias in the early 1960s were discovered in boxes stored in an\nattic. In the boxes were 894 original interview schedules,\nalong with letters, memos, and other notes and supporting\nmaterials. In the world of data archiving, this constitutes pure\ngold. Two researchers, O'Connor and Goodwin (2010),\nbegan a project of two phases, first to examine the recovered\ndata, and second to retrace and reinterview a sub-sample of\nthe original respondents. About 500 respondents had indi-\ncated on the original questionnaire that they were willing to\nbe contacted for subsequent research. Using many search\nstrategies, 157 were located and 97 agreed to be reinter-\nviewed, an extraordinary success given that nearly four\ndecades had elapsed. This case illustrates the immense\npotential of qualitative longitudinal research, and impor-\ntantly, it represents the genre of research where the analysts\nof secondary data proceed without assistance from, or even\ncontact with, the original investigator. The prevalence of\ndiverse configurations of teams composed of primary and\nsecondary collaborators should not detract from the demon-\nstrated viability of researchers coming fresh to newly discov-\nered data.\nIn Finland, work has also been a frequent topic of second-\nary analysis. Finns love to write, and as such, humanities and\nsocial science researchers collect written contributions by\norganizing writing competitions or by publishing requests in\nthe press asking people to write about certain issues and\nexperiences. One example of data collected in this in way is\nthe data set now archived at FSD titled, Stories about Fear\nwritten stories of approximately 500 pages (Eriksson, Koski,\nLuomanen, & Parviainen, 2011). The data were collected as\npart of the Leadership, Power and Fear (LEAR) research\nproject at the University of Tampere via an online research\nplatform in June 2008 that invited volunteers to write narra-\ntives about their experiences following a set of guidelines\n(Luomanen, 2009). Respondents provided essential back-\nground variables such as gender, education, age, the branch\nand size of their organization, and position at work at the\ntime. They were asked to describe intimidation events, what\nthey had been afraid of and why, what had led to the situa-\ntion, and how they had been intimidated. The writers were\nalso invited to describe situations where they themselves had\nresorted to intimidation at work and what the consequences\nhad been.\nThe final LEAR project data set did not need to be anony-\nmized by archivists. Not only was the background informa-\ntion collected using predefined codes, the writers were\ninstructed to tell the story without mentioning the proper\nnames of people or organizations they referred to. This \"self-\nanonymising\" aspect suggests that projects are increasingly\nplanned with reuse in mind and that respondents can be\nasked and trusted to take on some of these responsibilities for\nethical data sharing. The resulting stories can still be told in\na vivid and captivating way.\nThis data set has been reused for 29 different reuse pur-\nposes,includingsevenpublishedmasters'theses.Researchers\nare studying various aspects of working life, and they use the\ndata set to get ideas for refining their research questions, to\nplan new data collection, or to compare with their own data.\nSummary of Reuse Case Studies\nIt has proven challenging to determine what features make\ndata collections amenable to reuse, but the cases presented\nhere present some clues. For teaching, some features have\nbeen noted above: collections with multiple types of data,\ndata relevant to current policy debates, and topics of interest\nto young people. The research cases presented display some\nof these same features and also suggest that detailed data on\nbroad topics such as health, family, food, work, and poverty\nmake qualitative data appealing for secondary analysis.\nIntriguingly, it may be that when the topic of interest for\nreuse was not central in the original research that the primary\ndata may have the greatest reuse potential. This is particu-\nlarly true when it may be difficult to elicit direct responses\nbecause the topic is sensitive (health), morally laden (food),\nor taken for granted (family practices).\nConclusion\nAre we in any better position in 2016 to assess the state of\nsecondary analysis of qualitative data? In some regards, we\nbelieve the answer is yes. Data policy requirements are\ndiverse, and infrastructures are varied; however, expecta-\ntions in the United Kingdom are shifting: Twenty years ago,\nmost researchers would not have even considered sharing\nqualitative data; now, at least in the United Kingdom, there is\na growing belief that much data can be shared and reused,\nand exceptions need to be well justified. Significantly, there\nis institutional support and funding for reusing qualitative\ndata: the Economic and Social Research Council's (2016)\nSecondary Data Analysis Initiative includes qualitative data\nin its list of eligible resources. Whereas this is the case in the\nUnited Kingdom, it is still far from the situation elsewhere,\neven in countries such as Finland.\nAlthough evidence presented here is partial, there are\nmultiple indicators of growing reuse and the presence of the\napproach in highly regarded research methods events and\npublications further confirms that finding. We also know\nBishop and Kuula-Lummi 13\nthat three-fifths of the data collections (in scope and ana-\nlyzed in this work) at the UK Data Service are used, that\nteaching and learning are the primary purposes of reuse,\nand that usage is increasing reasonably steadily. In addi-\ntion, the cases presented above on health, food, family,\nwork, and poverty are just that, selected exemplary cases.\nThere is further evidence of expanding reuse of qualitative\ndata, sometimes across entire disciplines. In the United\nStates, Elman et al. (2010) describe what they call a \"renais-\nsance\" in qualitative research methods in political science,\nciting a proliferation of articles, books, and courses.\nWhat we find most exciting, and encouraging, is the\ndiversity of models developing even within the genre of\nsecondary analysis. In so many instances, data reuse prac-\ntices are emerging to enhance methodological robustness,\nfor example, by combining the breadth of quantitative\nscope with the depth of qualitative insight. The reuse of\ndata from especially hard-to-reach or vulnerable respon-\ndents--notably for teaching in the health area--gives stu-\ndents opportunities to work with rare data while\nminimizing patient burden. As for the context debate,\nmore may be good, but there is no doubt that researchers\nfind ways (as historians have long done) to use rich\nsources when available, yet still proceed carefully and\ncreatively when they are absent. And finally, examples of\ndata from studies done decades ago prove that even when\ncollaborations with the primary researchers are impossi-\nble, data from the past can still yield rich, relevant research\noutcomes.\n"
