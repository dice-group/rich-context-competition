    "abstract": "Abstract\nContemporary social science research is often concerned to engage with and promote particular\nforms of postmodern and innovative data production, such as photo-elicitation, autoethnography\nor free association interviews. This fascination with the latest and greatest techniques has been\naccompanied by an ever more fragmented range of research methods training for students\nwhere the week-by-week shift between approaches engenders a disjointed view of becoming the\nresearcher. This individualisation of techniques has set up rival camps and critiques where the\ncommon ground of being embedded in traditional ethnography is often forgotten. For researchers,\nwho began their academic careers in the ethnographic tradition, there is an appreciation of the\nholistic base of enquiry from which a family of methods can be effectively employed. However,\nmore recently qualitative researchers have been distracted by `the technique'; a distraction that\ncan blind them to the occupation of ethnography. Concurrently, there have been shifts in the\nsocial and economic expectations placed on qualitative inquiry that have acted to close down\nspaces of ethnographic teaching and practice. In response, this article focuses on the importance\nof the `waiting field'; an opportunity to explore the times where real lives carry on before they\nmake room for the intrusion of the data production of `the technique' and remind us that much\nqualitative research is, in fact, an ethnographic undertaking: one that encompasses the researcher\nwithin and beyond the field.\n",

Unsurprisingly,\nthe nature of the events led to conversations about methodology, methods and ethnogra-\nphy. In particular the second journey and the process of applying for the conference had\nbrought up the question \u00ad were we `doing ethnography'? It was a question that Dawn had\nreflected on in her viva when she had been asked if she would have done anything differ-\nently. At the end of the doctoral journey, Dawn knew that she should have appreciated\nearlier that she was an ethnographer, not simply someone employing techniques of data\nproduction.\nFor Melanie, there remained confusion, was she doing ethnography? Of course,\nMelanie was embedded in the field, it was ethnography; but she too had been blinded by\n`the technique'initially. However, the space of the journey, the time to think, engendered\nan agreement between two researchers, and two mothers, that our qualitative work could\nbe conceptualised in the analogy for motherhood, which is an evolving identity, not a\npart-time occupation; for we did not simply go into the field and apply a technique \u00ad we\nwere ethnographers, even though this privilege was not always fully realised or\nappreciated.\nThe emphasis on `the technique', rather than a holistic approach to qualitative inquiry,\nhas arguably been fostered by the critiques of, and inevitably defences of, the ethnogra-\npher's tools. The scrutiny of individual tools, although necessary, can also work as a\ndistraction, in that there is so much emphasis on the tools that the tool box of ethnogra-\nphy becomes invisible. For example, interviewing is a tool of data collection widely used\nby social researchers and in contemporary research many qualitative studies rely entirely,\nor primarily, on interview data (Hammersley, 2008). The charge of over reliance has\nattracted criticism alongside a more radical appraisal of interviews in which the potential\nfor the interview to engender access to information about the social worlds in which\ninformants live is challenged (Atkinson and Coffey, 2002).\nMore recently, autoethnography has been critiqued as a narcissistic preoccupation\n2010). Even the recent attractiveness of the visual has moved to a more critical juncture\nwhere the researchers are discussing the limitations of participatory visual methods\n(Packard, 2008) and critiquing the related philosophies, ethics and methodologies in\nspecial issues such as the International Journal of Research and Method in Education\nrecent edition `Problematising Visual Methods' (Lomax, 2012; Wall et al., 2012).\nThe problems attributed to one technique of data production are often followed by a\ncall for innovation such as Pink's (2009) direction to move beyond the visual to other\nsensory engagement. A new `latest and greatest' to enter into arguments of critique and\ndefence, which may further and refine our approaches, for we should not accept qualita-\ntive techniques at face value and risk research quality, but carefully discern their poten-\ntialities (Hammersley, 2007). However, at the same time there needs to be an awareness\nof the inherent dangers of engendering circular quarrels and opposing camps where we\ncould encourage collaboration.\nArguably, autoethnographic experimental pieces can take the reader into a particular\nsocial world and convey phenomenon through depictive techniques and textual devices\nthat foreground lived experience and carnal presence; becoming a form of self-narrative\nthat places the self within a social context (Doloriert and Sambrook, 2011; Poulos, 2010;\nTaber, 2010). Arguably, interviews can offer insights into the perspectives that govern\nbehaviour and can be a sound source of witness information about what happens in par-\nticular settings or in the world more generally (Hammersley, 2007). Visual techniques\nmay not be `a panacea for all ethnography's ills' (Ball and Smith, 2001: 313), but argu-\nably they too can move beyond the repertoire of preconceived understandings of place\nand space, unravel the diversity of urban experience and make the familiar strange and\nValue can be found, then, in individual techniques, but is this enough? There is an\nargument to triangulate and consider plurality; however, as Darbyshire et al. (2005)\nargue, multiple methods in qualitative research are not a guarantee of gaining more\ninsight. Perhaps, then, what is needed is a solid and secure foundation that underpins the\nresearch journey and offers the casing for these loose tools so that they become a func-\ntional tool kit. For example, in exploring the everyday use of young people's bedroom\nspaces Lincoln (2012) employs interviews, observations, multi-sensory ethnography and\nphoto-elicitation. Rather than adopting an orthodox ethnographic approach, Lincoln\ndraws on a family of research tools; however, importantly, it is the security of the ethno-\ngraphic base and her assurance of being an ethnographer that allows Lincoln to produce\nvaluable qualitative research. In relation to such examples of best practice this article\nposes the question: can we move beyond `the technique'and draw on wider ethnographic\ntraditions to make the most of our research journeys?\nTomorrow's ethnographers?\nThis is a particularly salient question when considering the future of qualitative research\nand the new generations of researchers graduating from universities. Orsini-Jones (2010:\n3) reflects on how she was `taken aback by the levels of anxiety expressed by students\nwith reference to their engagement with the planning of their independent piece of\nresearch'; an anxiety we recognise from our experience of the supervision process.\nHowever, in a school of social sciences, where students have been involved in two years\nof research methods training, it is often disappointing to find that their fears and their\nreluctance to engage in a holistic methodological approach are a product of the lack of\nepistemic cognition.\nAt the risk of simplifying a complex concept, the term epistemic cognition relates to\nan understanding of the nature of knowledge and knowing (Avramides and Luckin,\n2007); and this apprehension about, and disengagement with, ontological and epistemo-\nlogical questions is problematic. For example, the experience of supervising social sci-\nence undergraduate students in their qualitative third year dissertation projects has made\nus aware of a tendency for students to discuss their proposed techniques of data produc-\ntion/collection without reference to any secure foundation, ethnographic or otherwise. In\nthis way, rather than demonstrating epistemic cognition, they engage in strategies to\navoid what Orsini-Jones (2010: 341) refers to as `troublesome knowledge'.\nStudents' epistemic cognition has been explored under a variety of conceptual frame-\nworks, including epistemological beliefs, personal epistemology and epistemic resources\nthat students lack a complex understanding of the nature of knowledge (Hofer and\nenvision rigorous qualitative research without any theoretical connections', but in the\ntechnique-led approaches often favoured by emerging researchers these inadequate\nfoundations are evident. In this article, then, we are arguing not only that researchers\nmove beyond `the technique'but that as tutors we are able to enhance the students'learn-\ning and scaffold students' epistemic understanding of their qualitative research projects.\nFor students, and perhaps for contemporary researchers more generally, it is tempting\nto rush into the field armed with audio recorder and camera. However, there needs to be\nan opportunity to reflect on where research is located epistemologically and find ways to\nmake `troublesome knowledge' less troublesome: so that new researchers can engage\nusefully with projects of qualitative inquiry. Rather than going into the field with `the\ntechnique', students need to be encouraged to practice rigorous qualitative research. This\npaper proposes an "
