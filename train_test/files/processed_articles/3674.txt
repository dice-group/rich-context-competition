    "abstract": "Abstract\nMany census occupational classification systems have been developed over the last 150 years. Availability of digital census data\nsets now means such classifications can be systematically analyzed. Examination of heavy industrial workers in the full count\nU.S. 1880 census, and other censuses, has revealed major problems in the attribution of occupations to industrial sectors.\nThis is traceable to the original enumeration process, and it particularly affects generic tradesmen such as blacksmiths and\ncarpenters, who worked in numerous industrial sectors. As a result, the imputation of industrial sector codes from recorded\noccupations by the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) is substantially in error, suggesting that re-coding of existing\ncensus records using non-census sources would be necessary for such industrial sector codes to have empirical validity. A\nnew occupational/industrial coding system, incorporating the NAPP-modified HISCO scheme, is presented. This system is\ncapable of supporting both future re-coding work, in a structured data warehouse environment, and the systematic coding\nof occupational data from a range of archival sources such as company records and city directories.\n",

Whether it was tracking the overall progress of indus-\ntrial society, urban industrial specialization, the social mobil-\nity of immigrants or finding surrogate measures of wealth\nand social class, occupational information was one of the\nmost valuable tools available to census statisticians and offi-\ncials in other government agencies (Edwards, 1933).\nHowever, the quest for a satisfactory system of classification\nfor the U.S. census was still in progress at the start of the\nMuch more recently, the growing availability in digital\nform of large historical population data sets containing indi-\nvidual-level data, anonymized or otherwise, has re-kindled\ninterest within several academic disciplines in the seemingly\nrather dry topic of occupational classification. However, this\nsame availability of large data collections, which are now\nopen to systematic evaluation using powerful database tech-\nnologies, in ways that were infeasible until relatively recent\ntimes, has begun to raise a number of questions. These relate\nnot only to the 19th century census enumeration practices\nand published statistics based on the resulting 19th century\ncensus figures but also to the validity, reliability, and \"fit-\nness-for-purpose\" of electronic coding, both of occupational\ndata transcribed from manuscript census schedules and of\nother measures derived partly or wholly from these data. It is\nimportant that such questions are examined sooner rather\nthan later, as funding bodies are increasingly relying on the\navailability of large secondary data sets, as part of a drive for\nefficient use of public monies for research. Yet, in most\ncases, much less effort has been expended to date in deter-\nmining the quality of these data sets and their suitability for\ndifferent types of analyses, than would ideally be the case,\ngiven they are intended to form an accepted part of general\nresearch infrastructure internationally.\nIt is important to stress at the outset that this is not primar-\nily a criticism of the leading U.S. and European data archives\nand centers, such as the member organizations of the North\n1University of Portsmouth, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nRichard Healey, Department of Geography, University of Portsmouth,\nBuckingham Building, Lion Terrace, Portsmouth PO1 3HE, UK.\nEmail: richard.healey@port.ac.uk\nA New Occupational/Industrial\nCoding System for 19th Century\nU.S. Heavy Industrial Workers\nRichard Healey1\n Keywords\noccupational coding, census analysis, North Atlantic Population Project, industrial workers, HISCO codes\n2 SAGE Open\nAtlantic Population Project (NAPP), which have undertaken\nsterling work in making large demographic data sets acces-\nsible to researchers (Minnesota Population Center, 2008).\nRather, a distinction needs to be made between four potential\nsources of problems in these data sets, two of which relate to\nthe original manual collection and processing and two to the\nmuch later phase of conversion into digital form. The first\nderives from inherent shortcomings in the collection of the\noriginal data, while the second relates to the methodology\nused for the subsequent manual classification/tabulation,\nwhose end products were the published census tabulations.\nThe third involves transcribing and data entry errors in the\ndigitization process and the fourth is the digital equivalent of\nthe manual classification problem, namely, how data fields\nwithin the digital census records are to be coded accurately\nand consistently. A further question, which has been exam-\nined in the course of several large projects, is how coding\nconsistency can be extended beyond national boundaries to\nencompass international comparisons, although this topic\ngoes beyond the scope of the present discussion.\nAs there are numerous data fields, even in late 19th cen-\ntury census records (the digital version of the U.S. 1880 cen-\nsus has about 90 fields, for example), a detailed examination\nof these four types of problems in relation to each data ele-\nment in turn would be a major undertaking. The focus of\nattention here will therefore be restricted to an examination\nof quality issues surrounding the coding and classification of\noccupational and related industrial categories, and how they\ncan be addressed, as these are among the key types of infor-\nmation utilized by researchers (e.g., Hirschman & Mogford,\nmainly to consideration of the U.S. 1880 census because it is\nthe only complete count census available for that country in\ndigital form and thus it is becoming widely used as a refer-\nence point for all types of historical demographic analysis,\neven when earlier and later sample census data sets are also\nused in combination with it (Ruggles et al., 2010; Sobek &\nDillon, 1995). That said, questions have been raised about\nthe possible manipulation of occupational data, at the enu-\nmeration and processing stages, for the young, the elderly,\nand married women in this census (Carter & Sutch, 1996). It\nis also recognized that the 1880 time point was part of an\nextended process of \"learning by doing\" in the planning and\nexecution of decennial census-taking, so it must also be set\nwithin this broader context.\nThis article begins by identifying a number of problems\ninherent in the approach to coding of occupations adopted by\nNAPPfor the 1880 census, and by extension for the earlier and\nlater census samples the latter project has also made available.\nThese problems point to the requirements for a new coding\nsystem that removes the limitations identified. The main body\nof the article explains the design and implementation of this\nsystem that provides an operational basis for commencing the\nlong-term and difficult process of re-coding industry sector\ncodes in historical population censuses, which must\nnecessarily be undertaken using non-census sources. In the\nprocess, it will also be made clear that the new system can be\nused to classify and standardize employment and occupational\ndata from non-census sources independently and additionally\nto its deployment in support of future work on re-coding of\nindustry sector information in large census data sets.\nOccupational and Industrial Sector\nAt the outset, some examples serve to indicate why such a\nstudy needs to be undertaken. The first relates to the U.S.\nrailroad sector, a very important contributor to the processes\nroad employment data. The first is the person-level records\nfrom the population census, where individuals could iden-\ntify themselves as working in a railroad-related occupation\n(U.S. Census Office, 1883a). The second is a quite different\nspecial report on transportation, where each railroad com-\npany was asked to notify the Census Bureau of the total\nnumber of people in its employment (U.S. Census Office,\n1883b). Although a few local short-line railroads in isolated\nareas doubtless escaped enumeration, all lines of any sub-\nstance could be identified relatively easily, in terms of\nensuring quite comprehensive data coverage. As the compa-\nnies are all named in the report, it is also easy now, as it was\nthen, to check the figures against other reports made to State\nRailroad Commissioners in the different states. Such checks\nsuggest that considerable confidence can be placed in the\nreported figures, as state officials with local knowledge\nwould likely have been able to identify any attempts at sys-\ntematic misrepresentation in the data. The final employment\nin the railroad sector.\nIn the digital 1880 population census from NAPP, the\noriginal transcribed text strings describing occupations asso-\nciated with individual records have been standardized and\ncoded using a variant of the standard Historical International\nStandard Classification of Occupations (HISCO) scheme\n(explained further below) into many hundreds of numerical\ncategories represented by the US80A_OCC variable. A sec-\nond coding of occupations places them on a 1950 basis using\nthe variable US80A_OCC50US, to try and provide a consis-\ntent classification across multiple censuses, although this\nparticular variable will not be examined here further. Of the\nUS80A_OCC variable values, 18 codes refer directly to dif-\nferent aspects of steam railroad work and a further three\ndoubtless include railroad employees, but may also overlap\nwith horse-drawn street railroad employment, for example,\ncode 36010--unspecified conductors. Counting the records\nassigned to the 18 codes across the entire census yields a\ncategories raises the total to 251,490. The first figure very\nthe U.S. census, though there is no documentation on exactly\nhow that specific figure was obtained. This does, however,\nsuggest that the recently developed digital coding system for\noccupations closely reproduces earlier manual findings. This\nwould support the view that present day transcription and\ncoding has not introduced any significant new sources of\nerror, a similar finding to that reported by Woollard for work\non the historical censuses of the United Kingdom (Woollard,\n1999). That said, it is apparent that the railroad employment\ntotal based on the 18 codes is only 56.7% of the total from\nthe 1880 Special Report and adding the other three codes has\nrelatively little effect. Despite the substantial difference in\nthese two totals, there is no clear evidence from the literature\nthat this rather important disparity has ever been noticed or\nmade the subject of further investigation.\nOne possible approach to resolving the problem would\ninitially appear to be to use another variable from the 1880\nNAPP data set, namely, the industry classification (variable\nUS80A_IND50US), though this classification is also on a\nThis variable has a code (506) for \"railroads and railway\nexpress service,\" which has already been used in the pub-\nlished literature as part of a comparison of employment\nchanges in industrial sectors over time, although in this case\nthe IPUMS census samples, which use the same industrial\ncodes as the full NAPP data set, were used (Hirschman &\nmodest increase over the occupation code count, but it is less\napparent what the derivation of this figure is, as it does not\ncorrespond to the earlier calculations by Edwards noted\nabove. Although neither the NAPP documentation nor the\nstandard reference on NAPP occupational coding make this\nclear (Roberts, Woollard, Ronnander, Dillon, & Thorvaldsen,\n2003), the industry code is necessarily very largely imputed\nfrom the occupation data by the NAPP project and is not an\nindependent and additional source of data on individuals, as\nthere is no column in the manuscript census schedules for\nindustrial sector. The effect of this imputation can be seen by\ncross-referencing the occupational and industrial codes\nattached to individual records. Taking an example of five\nindustrial states (Pennsylvania, etc.), which have a total of\n88% have one of the 18 railroad occupation codes, a figure\nthat rises to 91%, if the three less specific categories are\nincluded. Working in the other direction, nearly 99% of indi-\nviduals with one of the 18 occupation codes have an indus-\ntrial code of 506, or nearly 97% if the wider definition is\nused. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, the industry code\nprovides no additional information over the occupation code.\nJudging by detailed examination of the original transcribed\noccupation text strings (which somewhat negates the value\nof having a code), the limited number of cases where the\nindustry code does provide additional information reflect\nsituations where additional non-standard text in the string in\nquestion allowed a more precise industrial sector attribution\nto be made. For example, a worker might be described as\n\"boilermaker in the B&O shops,\" which would identify him\nas a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad employee for the industry\ncode, but under occupation he would be standardized to just\n\"boilermaker.\" The data coders have thus endeavored to\nmake maximum use of any data present in the census. Despite\nthis painstaking work, still only 63.7% of the railroad work-\nforce can be identified on an individual basis, leaving in\nexcess of 150,000 workers unaccounted for in this industrial\nsector alone. Similarly, problematic findings have been\nreported for the anthracite coal mining sector, a large\nemployer in Pennsylvania, though in this case, use of occu-\npational data gave better results than the industry variable\nThis earlier study traced the source of the discrepancies\nin the employment counts to the distinction between work-\ners in generic occupations, such as blacksmiths and machin-\nists, and those in industry-specific occupations, such as coal\nminers or railroad brakemen. The large numerical impact of\nthese discrepancies does not appear to have been recognized\nin previous studies devoted to the problem of occupational\ncoding. In general, industry-specific occupations were quite\naccurately recorded in the population census, so industry\nsector can usually be imputed correctly for these workers.\nHowever, the vast majority of generic workers in 1880 did\nnot give census enumerators details of the industrial sector\nin which they worked, so it is not possible to impute the\nindustry correctly for these individuals without using non-\ncensus sources. Part of the reason for this can be attributed\nto the lack of clear instructions to enumerators about the\ncollection of occupational information, with the exception\nof the case of railroad clerks (Healey, 2011; U.S. Census\nOffice, 1880). Unfortunately, instead of recognizing the\nproblem both in the data set and in the documentation for\nthe industry variable, the NAPP project has made incorrect\nindustry imputations for hundreds of thousands of workers\nin generic occupations.\nA brief analysis of the occupational/industry code combi-\nnations in the entire 1880 data set makes clear how serious a\nproblem this is. Taking the case of blacksmiths, 99% of the\n\"miscellaneous repair services.\" Only 373 blacksmiths are\ncoded as railroad employees, 142 to different iron and steel\nrelated codes, and a mere five to coal mining. Such figures\nare entirely incorrect and extremely misleading. For exam-\nple, a single anthracite mine (the Diamond) out of more than\n100 in one of the four anthracite coalfields, employed four\nblacksmiths and three blacksmith's helpers in mid-1880\n(Diamond Payroll, 1880), so across both the anthracite and\nbituminous mining sectors, thousands of blacksmiths would\nhave been employed and the same would have applied to the\nother sectors named above. For machinists, the situation is\n4 SAGE Open\ncoded to the mysterious category of \"miscellaneous machin-\nHowever, the 1880 census special report has a specific break-\ndown of numbers of machinists (unlike blacksmiths), and it\nstates that 22,766 of them worked for the railroads across the\nUnited States (U.S. Census Office, 1883b). This means that\nmore than 21,000 of this sub-group are misclassified.\n\"outside mechanics\" employed at mines in the northern\nanthracite field (calculated from data in Inspectors of Mines,\n1880). While this definition may not exactly equate to\nmachinists, according to the NAPP data set there were no\nmachinists at all who worked in coal mining.\nPrior to 1880, the enumerators' instructions were no more\nspecific than in 1880, despite a minor caution against using\n\"machinist\" if a more precise description could be given\nsuggested in places the need for accurate qualification of job\ntitles, by means of isolated examples such as \"railroad\nlaborer\" or \"carriage blacksmith,\" but there is no clear recog-\nnition of the systematic need to distinguish generic from\nindustry-specific occupations. This can be seen in the com-\nplete omission of generic trades (as opposed to laborers)\nfrom the list of steam railroad occupations (U.S. Census\nunderreporting are to be expected both in the earlier and later\ncensuses. This is unequivocally demonstrable in the case of\n1890, as there was also a special report on transportation in\nthis year (though not in 1900). The special report gives a\ntime when railroad employment was still expanding, so the\nunderreporting issue was still not resolved by this date.\nAlthough attention has been focused on generic skilled\ntradesmen in the previous examples, unskilled general labor-\ners also make a substantial contribution to the overall prob-\nlem, because of their comparatively large numbers, and the\nlikelihood that their industrial sector was also not recorded\nby the enumerators. Further to this, laborers in irregular\nemployment, say in railroad construction, may well not have\nidentified themselves as part of the railroad industry, even if\nspecifically questioned to that effect.\nThe much wider implication of these problems is that the\nNAPP/IPUMS 1% sample census data sets for other census\ndifficulties of interpretation and inaccurate assignment of\nsample individuals to industrial sectors. Any research find-\nings based on these specific industrial codes may therefore be\nvery much in error, and these errors are unlikely to be consis-\ntent between different industrial sectors. The potential impact\non studies of inter-sectoral mobility is substantial. The same\napplies to inter-censal analyses of changing occupational/\nindustrial structure based on aggregate statistics, or of detailed\noccupational mobility, based on linked samples derived from\nNAPP or IPUMS data sets. This is apparent, because there is\nno means of determining from census records alone, whether\noccupational information about given linked individuals was\nrecorded in the same way in successive censuses, so workers\nmay appear to be railroad employees in one census but not the\nnext, when their employment status did not actually change.\nFurther to this, sampling from undifferentiated occupational\ngroupings, when those same groupings actually contain dif-\nferent sub-populations of individuals in different industrial\nsectors, may be a source of concealed bias in statistical stud-\nies. For example, it has already been shown that railroad\nmachinists and blacksmiths in Baltimore in 1860 had differ-\nent socio-demographic characteristics than their non-railroad\ncounterparts (Healey, Thomas, & Lahman, 2013). It is there-\nfore most important that these coding issues are more widely\ndiscussed and analyzed, to prevent inappropriate analyses\nbeing undertaken that generate misleading or false results. A\nfurther inference is that historical census data sets, standardly\nviewed as \"givens\" for secondary data analysis, should more\naccurately be viewed as \"works in progress,\" resources whose\ndata quality needs to be enhanced progressively over time, by\nmeans of comparison with other sources, to increase the con-\nfidence that can be placed in analytical results derived from\nthem. This is not a welcome finding for research funding bod-\nies, who would doubtless have wished that researchers could\ncapitalize on their past investments in large data sets without\nthe need for ongoing expenditure on quality improvement. It\nalso leaves some individual researchers in a quandary, as it is\nnow clear that the coded data presently available cannot sup-\nport certain types of analyses that would previously have\nbeen deemed viable. They can either restrict the scope of their\nwork (e.g., by avoiding use of industrial sector codes) or\nshoulder the rigorous additional burden of making the\nrequired data quality enhancements using non-census sources.\nWhile the latter may be a feasible strategy for well-resourced\nwork with limited geographical coverage, it is infeasible for\nindividuals wishing to engage in larger-scale studies. Also, in\nthe absence of any agreed approach to the use of non-census\nsources or how any re-coding might be undertaken, there is\nserious risk of incompatibilities quickly arising between stud-\nies, which will greatly hinder future comparative work.\nWhere studies only make use of very broad occupational cat-\negories (e.g., Ferrie, 2005), the impact of these detailed prob-\nlems may be lessened, but it can no longer be assumed that\nthey do not exist.\nRequirements for a New Coding\nSystem\nTo address this unwelcome situation in a systematic manner,\na new approach is required to the problem of quality enhance-\nment of existing historical census data sets, such as the NAPP\n1880 census. This involves several initial steps. The first of\nthese is to provide an overview of the main types of non-cen-\nsus sources that may eventually contribute to the re-coding\nprocess. The second is to evaluate what new developments, in\nterms of coding capabilities, are required to mesh together\ncensus and non-census sources. The third is to identify a suit-\nable computational methodology or methodologies that will\nsupport these new capabilities. The fourth is to identify opera-\ntional considerations that could facilitate the take-up of new\ncoding system capabilities, and finally, there is the need to\noutline future possibilities for systematic re-coding projects\n(e.g., of specific industrial sectors) of sufficient substance to\ndemonstrate unambiguously the full nature and extent of the\ndata quality problems for the sectors in question, and to pro-\nvide guides to assist subsequent projects aimed at other sec-\ntors. The main emphasis of the present discussion will be on\nthe first three of these steps, followed by a brief commentary\non the remaining two stages, the implementation of which\nlies, at least in part, in the future.\nThe first question to address is which other non-census\nsources are available to assist with census (re-)coding. A\nrange of these can be identified in the U.S. context, but they\nvary widely in their temporal, geographical, and sectoral\ncoverage and indeed their degree of comprehensiveness,\neven for specific locations and time points. Among the most\nobvious candidates are city directories, company payrolls,\nmarriage and death records, and naturalization records. Less\nobvious candidates would include the harrowing industrial\naccident records found in state railroad commission reports\nand mine inspectors' reports. While space precludes a\ndetailed survey of these sources, several brief comments\nserve to highlight relevant issues. The census has the enor-\nmous advantage of relative geographical comprehensive-\nness over a broadly comparable time interval (the concept of\na precise census date was not well-developed in earlier\nyears), and provides information on age, family, and house-\nhold status, occupation and birthplace. Marriage and death\nrecords will provide a subset of this information possibly\nwith links to parental names. Company records, such as pay-\nrolls, being employment-focused, lack much of this infor-\nmation, including age-related data (though this may be\nfound in employee card indexes). However, this is offset by\nthe detailed work history information they contain.\nDirectories, though largely confined to urban areas, have\nvarying degrees of comprehensiveness for the populations\nthey served, lack age or family data, but provide addresses\nand often contain valuable employment-related information\nfor multiple time-slices falling between census years. The\npotential research benefits of being able to combine data\nabout individuals over time and space from these and other\nrelevant sources are easy to see, though the practical prob-\nlems of achieving the required data linkage in a reliable\nmanner may be quite another matter.\nTo examine some of these sources in more detail, experi-\nence with city directories, for example, suggests they are\nmost informative for occupational purposes in the 1850s to\n1870s, rather than in later years, and the larger the city the\nless informative, owing to pressure on space in individual\nvolumes. By more informative, is meant more likely to pro-\nvide not only an occupation for each individual, but also an\nindustrial sector or even specific manufacturing establish-\nment/company department (e.g., foreman of the car repair\nshop of a specific named railroad). Comprehensiveness of\npopulation coverage probably increased over time, as direc-\ntory compilers became more organized and better funded,\nthough systematic studies of this are largely lacking\n(Goldstein, 1954). Payrolls are usually much more detailed,\nthough far more sporadic in space and time. Thus, only a\nsmall fraction of 19th century anthracite mines have surviv-\ning payrolls, and regrettably even fewer railroads, but the\ndocuments that do survive, will reveal much finer job sub-\ndivisions than \"coal miner\" or \"railroad hand.\" They may\nalso indicate the department of the company in which\nemployees worked, and provide information on how they\nwere paid (piece-work or hourly) and the regularity of work\nover shorter or longer periods, depending on the length of\nsurviving records. The clear advantage of payroll records,\nand indeed industrial accident records, because the informa-\ntion is firm specific, is that they are guaranteed to address the\nproblem of identifying generic workers in specific industrial\nsectors at particular dates. This is not standardly the case for\ncity directories, although some early volumes do contain a\ngood deal of the requisite information.\nSetting aside questions about relative ease of processing\nof printed versus manuscript sources, and the major topic of\nnominal record linkage between different sources (for a\nreview, see Winkler, 2006), which are beyond the present\nscope, key requirements for an occupational coding system\nthat facilitates re-coding of census records using non-census\ndata can now be identified, based on the range of information\nthat may be available in different types of non-census\nsources. First, and most importantly, the system must enable\nworkers in generic occupations to be \"tagged\" with their spe-\ncific industrial sector, where known. Second, it should extend\nbeyond the rather general occupational categories favored by\ncensus enumerators and \"genealogical\" sources, such as\nmarriage records, to encapsulate the greater range of employ-\nment information provided by payrolls, industrial accident\nrecords, and many early directories. This information\nincludes detailed job titles, major and minor sub-divisions\nwithin companies and whether employees were engaged in\nconstruction work or activity related to production/opera-\ntion. Thus, the system should be able to distinguish black-\nsmiths involved in railroad construction from those employed\nin the operation of rolling mills in the iron industry. Such\ndistinctions are impossible to make with the version of the\nHISCO coding system used for the U.S. 1880 census and the\nsamples from earlier and later censuses. This is the main rea-\nson why a new system is required. Further to this, however,\nif non-census sources are to be used, it is sensible to abstract\nas much relevant information on employment structure from\n6 SAGE Open\nthem in a single pass as possible, to avoid the need to keep\nreferring back to them for more detailed information. In this\nsense, the resulting occupational/industrial code then serves\nas a kind of employment structure index to the archival\nsource (e.g., a payroll), in addition to its main function as a\nclassificatory device. This proves to have wider implica-\ntions, as will be seen below. At the same time, the wide usage\nof the HISCO system means that backward compatibility\nwith it should also be provided by the new system. Relating\ndetailed job titles to the more general HISCO categories also\nobviates the necessity for a separate look-up table of indi-\nvidual titles. Finally, unlike some of the older systems devel-\noped in the pre-Internet era, it will be assumed that the\nsystem can take full advantage of a range of readily available\ndigital and database-related technologies, including Web\nconnectivity.\nFocus of the New Coding System\nAs Wrigley has correctly observed, there is no right or wrong\nin terms of coding systems, but each will have a particular\nclass of problems to which it is especially well suited\n(Wrigley, n.d.). In his case, Wrigley adopted a focus on the\ndistinction between primary, secondary, and tertiary (PST)\nsectors in the economy, because of a particular interest in the\nchanging relative importance of these sectors over the long\nterm as the Industrial Revolution progressed. Herschberg, in\ncontrast, seems to have sought an all-encompassing census\ncoding system, with a certain focus on industrial sectors,\nthough his precise aims are not very clearly articulated, and\nthere is no recognition of the problems caused by lack of\nspecificity in the occupational/industrial sector enumeration\nof generic workers (Herschberg, 1976). In the present sys-\ntem, a particular, though not exclusive, focus is on the ques-\ntion of occupational and geographical mobility of heavy\nindustrial workers. This has many facets, as workers can\nchange jobs within and between industrial concerns in the\nsame sector or utilize existing generic skills in new ways by\nchanging industrial sector, for example, a machinist moving\nfrom the mining to the railroad industry. Such occupational\nmovements, which may be upward, horizontal, or occasion-\nally downwards, in terms of the job and remuneration hierar-\nchy, may or may not be accompanied by geographical\nmobility. Changes of location in pursuit of career advance-\nment have been characterized as a major feature of the\nproblem of mobility touches on a wide range of debates\nabout immigration and 19th century economic growth\nA focus on occupational mobility has also been the pre-\nferred approach in relation to the U.S. Department of Labor\nDictionary of Occupational Titles (Miller, Trieman, Cain, &\nRoos, 1980). A substantial body of work on coding systems,\nboth for the U.S. census and for inter-agency work within the\nU.S. Government, undertaken in the first half of the 20th\ncentury and summarized by Palmer (1939), concluded that\nrigorous and consistent classification based on a distinction\nbetween skilled and unskilled work was infeasible. In con-\ncontext, have stressed the need for any coding system to\nreflect both occupational characteristics and industrial sector\naffiliation. This is particularly significant, as the NAPP-\nmodified HISCO system (Roberts et al., 2003) does not do\nthis as part of its structure, though some specialized occupa-\ntions will tend to be associated with particular industrial\ncategories.\nGeneral Design Criteria for the New\nSystem\nThere are four general design criteria for the system that\nneed to be explained prior to detailed treatment of the indi-\nvidual components of the overall structure. The first derives\nfrom the requirement stated above that the system must be\nable to code both census/vital registration records and occu-\npational data from industrial/company records. The HISCO\nsystem was only developed on the basis of the former type of\ndata (Van Leeuwen, Maas, & Miles, 2004). Second, as the\ncoding system is intended to capture the more detailed infor-\nmation derived from company records and some city directo-\nries, it should be able to do this in a way that facilitates\nanalysis of occupational mobility within industrial sectors, as\nwell as among them. None of the systems in current use sup-\nport this type of analysis. The third criterion is that a single\ncode will be used, rather than a multi-component code, as in\nthe case of the PST and Herschberg systems. Likewise, as\nnoted earlier, NAPP data sets have separate industrial and\noccupational codes. The present codes therefore span both\nindustrial sector and occupational categories. While this may\ninitially appear to hairsplitting, it proves to be of major\nimportance in implementation terms. The final criterion is\nthat the coding system is strictly hierarchical, even if this\nmakes it appear \"verbose\" in places. The combination of\nthese two criteria allows this system, unlike its predecessors,\nto be used in the exacting implementation environment of a\nproperly constructed data warehouse, where in-built Online\nAnalytical Processing (OLAP) functions allow automated\naggregation and dis-aggregation of categories and sub-cate-\ngories of data, based on different hierarchical levels in the\noccupational coding of individual records (Healey, 2011).\nWithin the overall structure, there are eight hierarchical lev-\nels, as indicated in Table 1. As with all such systems, there is\nno intrinsic validity to this number of levels, but it was found\nin pilot tests on different industry sectors that it allowed for\nconsiderable detail about the nature of employment catego-\nries within industrial concerns to be captured, as well as\ninter-sector differences. This is obviously of particular value\nwhen working with company records, which have not formed\nthe basis of the better-known systems reported in the litera-\nture. Each level is represented by a specific number of digits\nin the code, the number of digits varying between levels, as\nrequired. In the first version of the system, the overall code is\n14 digits long. Simple database string manipulation func-\ntions allow any level sub-code or combination of sub-codes\nto be selected, in addition to the entire code, so it is very flex-\nible in use. The individual levels will now be examined in\nmore detail, and the full implementation can be examined\nIndividual-Level Sub-Codes\nFrom Table 1, it is apparent that the numbering of levels\nruns from the highest at 8 (the most general) to 1 (the lowest\nand most disaggregated). Level 8 (2 digits) is the broadest\nlevel of industrial classification in the system. Comparison\nwith other systems shows a great variety of methods of clas-\nsifying industrial sectors. For 19th century purposes,\nHerschberg (1976), for example, found earlier releases of\nthe present day Standard Industrial Classification (SIC; U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, 2011) to contain\nanachronisms. The SIC also omits categories now unimport-\nant, but previously extremely large, for example, anthracite\ncoal mining. Equally, the industrial codes used by NAPP\ncorrespond to the system set out by the Bureau of the Census\ndesigned primarily for 20th rather than 19th century census\ncoding, this system is subject to exactly the same criticisms\nleveled at the SIC codes above, for example, it merges\nanthracite and bituminous mining, fails to distinguish canal\ntransportation from other kinds of transportation on inland\nwaterways and groups blast furnaces, steel works, and roll-\ning mills together into a single code. It also provides guid-\nance on which occupations fall within which industrial\nsectors, but in the present context some of its specific direc-\ntives are very problematic, such as the instruction to include\nmine laborers under the very general and uninformative cat-\negory of \"operatives and kindred workers,\" rather than\nunder the still too broad category of \"coal mining\" (U.S.\nBureau of the Census, 1950, p. xx). Given the rather limited\nattention, apparently given in this system to proper hierar-\nchical structuring of the codes into major and minor catego-\nries, and the problems listed above, there is little to be gained\n(and a good deal to lose) by trying to match the 1950 indus-\ntrial codes to those used here. Indeed, by deliberately mak-\ning the present codes quite different, it reinforces the\nargument above that the 1950 codes, as deployed by NAPP,\ncontain limited useful information which reduces their value\nfor detailed analytical purposes. As the coding system has\nprimarily been established for heavy industrial workers, in\nthe first instance, the Level 8 categories currently imple-\nmented include coal mining, iron and steel, and transporta-\ntion.These categories are more than sufficient to demonstrate\nthe structure and operation of the overall system.\nLevel 7 (1 digit) provides appropriate sub-categories of the\nmain industries. Thus, coal mining is currently divided into\nanthracite and bituminous mining. To the non-specialist, this\nmay appear unnecessary. However, the marked difference in\nthe ratios of \"inside\" (underground) to \"outside\" workers and\nthe major differences in the range of outside occupations\nbetween the two sub-categories provide the rationale for this.\nAnthracite coal requires extensive processing and sorting into\nsize fractions in a \"coal breaker\" after being hoisted to the\nsurface, whereas bituminous coal does not, so the range of\noccupational types and the number of outside employees is\nmuch larger in the former case (DiCiccio, 1996). This level\nalso distinguishes primary iron manufacture from steelmak-\ning, a necessary distinction even after more integrated iron\nand steel works began to appear from the late 1860s to early\ntransportation category, railroads are currently implemented,\nbut additional sub-categories will obviously be required in\nfuture, for canal workers and employees in other forms of\nnavigation on inland waterways, both major rivers and the\nGreat Lakes.\nLevel 6 (1 digit) makes the important distinction between\nworkers who are engaged in productive enterprise and those\nwho are responsible for the construction of mines, mills, and\nconduits of transportation, such as railroad lines or canals.\nThere are many reasons for wanting to maintain such a dis-\ntinction. For example, construction activity, following on\nfrom investment decisions, was broadly cyclic in nature and\ncould attract hundreds or even thousands of workers to spe-\ncific localities for extended periods of time, running into\nyears for large mining or railroad developments (Healey\net al., 2013). However, once construction was completed and\nproductive operations began, the nature of employment\nopportunities could change rapidly, necessitating substantial\ngeographical mobility of labor, in search of continuing work.\nFor example, various stages of wooden coal breaker con-\nstruction required large numbers of carpenters, but once a\nspecific mine was in operation, the demand for these generic\ntradesmen at that location dropped sharply (and standard car-\npentry skills were not immediately transferable to\nTable 1. Hierarchy of Levels in the New Coding System.\nLevel Description\n8 Major industry categories\n7 Major industry sub-categories\n6 Production/construction breakdown\n5 Company sub-division or sub-type breakdown\n4 Company detailed operating/production sub-division\n3 Main job type divisions (incorporating highest level of\nNAPP-modified HISCO codes)\n2 Job sub-divisions (incorporating middle level of NAPP-\nmodified HISCO codes)\n1 Detailed job titles (incorporating full individual NAPP-\nmodified HISCO codes, where available)\nNote. NAPP = North Atlantic Population Project; HISCO = Historical\nInternational Standard Classification of Occupations.\n8 SAGE Open\nthe specialized job of \"inside timber-man,\" responsible for\nshoring up underground mine workings). Accurate identifi-\ncation of construction workers is much more likely to be pos-\nsible when payroll information is available, although\njustifiable inferences can also be made under appropriate\ncircumstances, for example, when a city directory lists a\nworker employed at a specific mine and it is known from\nother sources that this mine is under construction at the time\nin question. Examination of the NAPP 1880 data set suggests\nthat industrial construction activity is very largely hidden\nfrom view, not least because the vast majority of the large\ncadre of construction laborers are simply reported under the\ngeneric laborer codes.\nLevel 5 and Level 4 (each 1 digit) enable increasingly\ndetailed tracking of the main and detailed sub-divisions/\ndepartment within a company where individual employees\nworked and, depending on the particular industry sub-sector,\ntheir relationship to their employer in contractual terms.\nTaken together, they represent an important contribution to\ncoding methodology, because such information is largely\nlacking from all the standardly used systems (even\nHerschberg's extensive coding structure does not approach\nthe level of detail captured here). Where the necessary data\nto inform the coding is available, these levels can be used to\nanalyze horizontal and vertical occupational mobility of\nworkers within a single large firm. This mobility may also\nhave an important geographical component if the firm oper-\nates on multiple sites. While the best choice of level at which\nto make certain sub-divisions may be arguable, pilot testing\nindicated that Level 5 should be used for major sub-divisions\nof productive activity and Level 4 for more detailed sub-divi-\nsions. Not all industry sectors would necessarily require use\nof both levels, in which case a \"pass-through\" mechanism is\ndeployed, whereby the classification from the level above is\nsimply repeated one level down. This is an example of how\nthe code may appear verbose or slightly redundant in some\ninstances, but the advantages of a standardized hierarchical\nstructure, common to all industries, greatly outweighs any\nminor lack of elegance in implementation. Thus, at Level 5,\nthe iron industry sub-divides into different types of activity,\nwhich may or may not be found on the same site. These\ninclude blast furnaces, rolling mills, and foundries. At Level\n4 in rolling mills, for example, contract or piece-workers are\nseparated from workers paid a daily wage. A somewhat anal-\nogous process applies to anthracite mining, where Level 5\nseparates inside from outside workers, and with Level 4\ninside workers, \"company men\" paid a daily or monthly\nwage are coded differently to contract miners, paid by the car\nof coal mined and loaded. These distinctions are immedi-\nately apparent when processing anthracite mine payrolls and\npresent very few problems of interpretation under these cir-\ncumstances. In the absence of such archival sources, it may\nbe very difficult to benefit fully from these coding distinc-\ntions, as neither the census nor city directories report at this\nlevel of detail and the undifferentiated term of \"coal miner\"\nor even just \"miner\" is normally found. For railroads, Level\n5 currently serves as a pass-through, but Level 4 is very\nimportant because it is used to reflect the standard depart-\nmental and accounting breakdown that came to be used on\nmost railroads during the 19th century. The main sub-divi-\nsions are Conducting Transportation, Maintenance of Way,\nand Motive Power. The first of these is concerned with the\ndaily operation of train services, both freight and passenger.\nMaintenance of Way covers all track and depot repairs and\nMotive Power refers to the building and repair of locomo-\ntives and rolling stock and all associated engine-house and\nmachine shop functions. An early reference to such a clas-\nsificatory scheme, crediting the Georgia Railroad as the orig-\ninator, can be found in the 1850 annual report of the\nPennsylvania Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad, 1851).\nInitially, \"maintenance of cars\" was treated as a separate\ndepartment, but over time this was merged into the \"motive\npower\" heading. With minor variations, the scheme was\nwidely adopted by the 1880s. For coding purposes, the\nscheme has been extended to include a category of \"General\nAdministration,\" as, by convention, these administrative\nemployees and company officers were not included in the\nthreefold sub-division above. There are also \"catch-all\" cat-\negories for employees for whom detailed information is not\navailable. Interestingly, in cases where payrolls are available\nfor years prior to the adoption of the scheme by a given rail-\nroad, aggregation of individual lower-level job codes (see\nbelow) to these Level 4 categories has already been shown to\nprovide a very effective standardized means of analyzing the\nchanging employment structure of a given railroad over\ntime. By extension, it can also be used effectively for system-\natic comparison of the structure of different railroads (Healey\nThe lowest three levels (1-3) are designed to provide\ncompatibility with the NAPP-modified HISCO coding sys-\ntem, while also enabling this system to be extended substan-\ntially to include the much wider range of specific occupations\nfound in non-census records. The maximum possible com-\npatibility is sought, subject to the constraints of a strictly\nhierarchical coding system. While HISCO very largely meets\nthese requirements, there are occasions where lack of consis-\ntency or other considerations required slight modifications to\nbe made or minor re-naming to take place. The effects of\nthese changes are limited, however, so the overwhelming\nmajority of HISCO codes can be readily identified within the\nnew system. However, some modifications that do require\nhighlighting at the outset are that the codes as they appear on\nthe NAPP list have an additional digit to the left and two to\nthe right of the code in the present system. Partly, as a conse-\nquence of this, the division of the code into levels for hierar-\nchical decomposition differs slightly from that in the original\nHISCO scheme. In the latter, codes have the form 9.99.99,\nwhere 9 is the placeholder. The highest level (one digit) rep-\nresents major groups, the middle-level (two digits) minor\ngroups, and the lowest level (two digits) the individual\noccupational categories (Van Leeuwen et al., 2004). In the\nshow the new digits, but, as can be seen, the five HISCO\ndigits remain, though divided slightly differently.\nExamining the new expanded structure above, Level 3 (2\ndigits) corresponds to the HISCO major groups, which can\nbe given broad labels such as \"Professional and Technical\"\n(sub-code 01) or \"Production, Construction and Transport\"\n(sub-code 09). The additional digit is used to provide a 10th\ncategory, not found in HISCO, which cover the varied\ninstances where occupation is lacking, but useful informa-\ntion is still provided, for example, for retired persons. This\npermits inclusion within the code of data that in the HISCO\nscheme is separated out into multiple additional variables\nsuch as STATUS or RELATION, that do not form part of the\ndigit) provides a middle-level breakdown, corresponding to\nthe first part of the HISCO minor grouping, although it is\nargued that the categories used here are much more obvious\nthan in the NAPP/HISCO code list (NAPP Code List, 2013)\nand have been given clear labels. For example, under the\nLevel 3 sub-code 09 for inside company workers in anthra-\ncite mines, the Level 2 sub-categories are mine development\nequipment operators (098), and workers not elsewhere clas-\nsified (099). Comparison with the NAPP code list immedi-\nately shows how the present system aims to preserve\ncompatibility with HISCO wherever possible, but does not\nallow the latter to restrict necessary extensions/modifications\nto the code structure. Thus, HISCO has no equivalent of\nmine development workers, as it lacks sufficient detail to\ncode them separately. Consequently, the codes in HISCO\nbeginning with 95, which relate to various types of building\nwork, are deployed in this specific branch of the system con-\ncerned with mining, to refer to \"building\" work inside the\nmine, which is necessary for mine development under-\nground, but which is not actual mining of coal. In contrast,\nmajor types of stationary engine operators can be readily\nidentified in the NAPP list as codes starting with 96, so these\ncan be deployed directly in the current system, but with the\nadditional interpretation at this point, derived from the higher\nlevels of the code, that they are stationary engine operators\nworking inside a mine. The same type of argument can be\napplied to the other Level 2 sub-categories in this example.\nAt Level 1 (5 digits), considerable additional detail about\nspecific individual occupations can be coded. The first three\nof these digits comprise the remainder of the full HISCO\ncode for the occupation in question, assuming it appears in\nthe NAPP code list. The final two digits provide the ability to\nadd extensive refinements of the HISCO occupational cate-\ngories, based on additional information from company\nrecords, or to add new codes for jobs that are not found in the\nNAPP code list. Thus, to continue with the stationary engine\noperators example for inside mining employees, the full\nNAPP/HISCO code for \"Stationary engineers and engine\nmen\" is 96230. This appears as an entry in the present sys-\nis embedded in this more expanded code. However, other\nsub-categories, such as \"donkey runner\" (for operator of\nauxiliary \"donkey\" engine) or pump-man, neither of which\nhave NAPP/HISCO equivalents, appear as sub-codes of sta-\ndigit positions are fixed in the code, it is a trivial database\noperation to select all codes that refer to stationary engineers,\nwherever they appear under different branches of the system,\nsuch as inside mines, in blast furnaces, or in railroad motive\npower divisions. This means that the system can immedi-\nately be used to generate aggregate occupational statistics\nthat are compatible with those that can be derived from the\nNAPP census data sets. Table 2 provides a further illustration\nof the overall structure of the coding system, using an exam-\nple of workers in a rolling mill and following this specific\noccupational sub-tree down through the eight levels. The\nthree dots \". . .\" in several cells in the table indicate that there\nare additional categories at the level in question, which are\nnot shown for reasons of clarity.\nExpanding the Range of Occupational\nTitles--Coding Issues and Data Sources\nWithin the coding system, the occupational description that\naccompanies each code at the lowest level may be derived\nfrom a variety of sources. The more generic job titles cor-\nrespond to those in the NAPP/HISCO system and are read-\nily identifiable as a result. However, as previous studies\nhave pointed out, the NAPP/HISCO coverage of occupa-\ntional types found within different industrial sectors is very\nvariable. Thus, there are 18 different NAPP/HISCO codes\nspecifically associated with railroads, but only two codes for\nthe mining industry (71120 \"miners,\" which unhelpfully\nincludes both coal and ore miners, and the general and very\nrarely used 71190 \"others working in mines and quarries\").\nThe rather unclear code 71200 \"mineral or stone treaters\"\nmight also be partially relevant, but it is not obvious from\nthe code list whether this relates to mining activity as nor-\nmally understood (see below). This comprehensive failure\nto recognize the occupational complexity of the mining\nindustry was particularly striking to the present writer,\nbecause earlier unrelated analysis of anthracite mine pay-\n200 distinct types of work could be identified without any\ndifficulty. More recent work on payrolls from the 1860s, as\nthis coding system was developed, and mine inspectors'\nreports from the 1870s onward has further extended this list\nof job types to around 300 in total, not all of which are yet\nincorporated in the system (Healey, 2013).\nAlso, in an attempt to clarify the use of the code 71200 in\nthe NAPP 1880 census data set, the detailed occupational\ntranscriptions for workers with this code were examined on a\nsample basis. This revealed interesting and important lessons\nin the present context, both for those engaged in the coding\nof census occupations, and subsequent users of the coded\ndata. As noted earlier, a unique characteristic of anthracite\nmines was the requirement to prepare the coal for market in\nlarge \"breakers\" on the surface (Hudson Coal Company,\n1932). This meant that large numbers of boys (and some\nelderly ex-miners) were employed at each anthracite mine to\nhelp with this preparation process, which was only partially\nmechanized in the 19th century. Many thousands of these\n\"breaker boys\" or \"slate pickers\" (so-called because they\nremoved rock or \"slate\" from the coal before it was loaded\ninto railroad cars) were employed in the anthracite coalfields,\nbut not in the bituminous mining regions, where breakers\nwere not required. In the NAPP data set, these boys have\nalmost all been coded to 71200. This separates them from\n\"miners\" per se and their NAPP/HISCO occupational\ndescription tends to mislead rather than inform, as they are\nnever described as \"mineral treaters\" in the mining literature.\nThe rationale for this coding decision is also much more\napparent following the above explanation of the work of\nbreaker boys, than it is when examining a code list to identify\npotential mining industry employees, as one group among\nmany chosen for analysis. Put another way, if it is necessary\nto utilize detailed industry knowledge and the original occu-\npational transcriptions to understand the use of a code, then\nit is probably not a very effective numerical shorthand.\nFurther to this, from an industrial sector perspective, use of\n71200 confounds coal mining-related activity with unrelated\nstone-dressing in quarries or mineral ore processing to an\nunknown degree in any county data set, though it is fortunate\nthat anthracite is only mined in a very limited number of U.S.\ncounties. In contrast, these breaker boys are always reported\nas an integral part of the anthracite mining industry, both in\nmine inspectors' reports and in company payrolls them-\nselves. The present system therefore identifies them under\nanthracite industry employees paid by the day to work\noutside the mine in the coal breaker. To avoid perpetuating\nthe confusion generated by the 71200 code, a different code\nnot used by NAPP/HISCO, namely 99000, has been used\nhere, to provide the basis for sub-codes to match the lengthy\nlist of job types found in coal breakers.\nAlthough the NAPP/HISCO codes are more informative\nand differentiated for the railroad than the mining sector, the\n18 codes still only represent a small fraction of the job types\nactually found in railroad employment. They are excellent\nfor trainmen, who would fall under the \"conducting transpor-\ntation\" heading, but not for the generic trades more promi-\nnently found in railroad shops, who were classified under\n\"motive power.\" To remedy this deficiency and provide a\nmore balanced coverage of occupational types across the\nsector, two main sources were used to provide a list of about\n300 job titles. These include the published payroll lists of the\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, which cover the years 1842 to\n1858) and the reports of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Industrial\nThe latter are especially important, as they contain details of\nthe occupational structure, including job titles, of large num-\nbers of different railroads, large and small, within the state\nbe considered exhaustive, comparison of the returns for the\ndifferent railroads in Pennsylvania with those of the\nBaltimore and Ohio in Maryland and Virginia provides an\nexcellent basis for the railroad job titles to be coded in the\npresent system. Most importantly, unlike NAPP/HISCO, this\nlist is not biased toward the trainmen, and provides good\ncoverage not only across all the three main departments of\nrailroad operation but also extending to categories of railroad\nconstruction workers, as these were recorded in the large\npayroll list of the Baltimore and Ohio in 1857.\nThe PBIS returns are not limited to railroad reports, and\nthey also provide details of employment in bituminous coal\nmines, in primary iron and steel manufacturing concerns, and\nin rolling mills. These have been utilized within the coding sys-\ntem, and, as would be expected, a distinction is made between\nTable 2. Example Occupational Sub-Tree Leading to Detailed Categories of Rolling Mill Workers.\nCoal mining \nTransportation \nIron and steel Steel \n. . . Iron Construction \n. . . Production Blast furnace \n Rolling mill Mill day workers \n . . . Mill contract\nworkers\nMining/Metal\nmanufacture\nMetal\nprocessors\nHeater rail mill\n . . . . . . Puddler\n Roller bar mill\n Rougher guide mill\n . . .\nworkers with otherwise similar titles, depending on whether\nthey were employed at blast furnaces or in foundries and so on.\nOverall, across the various sectors, the system currently\nhas 2,372 occupational entries, each of which has the eight\nlevels of the hierarchical code structure attached, making\nnearly 19,000 code values, though the number of different\njob titles is much smaller (814), because generic occupa-\ntions, such as machinist, will be found under several sector\nand sub-sector headings. Any user would only use the 2,372\nLevel 1 codes; the others are used by the data warehouse in\nwhich the code system is embedded. In any primary data\nsource, a number of individuals will have incomplete\nemployment attribution, for example some blacksmiths may\nbe known to be employed by a given iron and steel works,\nbut it is not stated whether they worked at the blast furnace\nor the foundry. To allow for this, every level of breakdown\nenables workers without a more precise lower-level classifi-\ncation to be coded as \"unspecified\" and the numbering con-\nvention is standardized for this (codes end in \"95\").\nExamples would be \"Inside Mine Worker Unspecified\nOccupation\" or \"Bloomery Worker Unspecified\nOccupation.\" Further to this, there are a group of codes for\ngeneric occupations in industries other than those currently\nhandled in detail. These codes still convey slightly more\ninformation than their HISCO equivalents, as identified\nworkers in these occupations in the main heavy industry cat-\negories have already been separated out. For example, they\nallow coding of individuals, who are recorded in city direc-\ntories as carpenters in furniture manufacturing plants. This\nflags the existence of some additional information in the\noriginal sources about these workers, should that be needed.\nIf such industries as furniture are specifically coded in\nfuture, these workers can be retrieved from the data set and\ngiven more precise codes at that time. Where no industrial\nsector attribution is available, separate codes again are\navailable to cover individuals who are simply recorded as\n\"carpenters\" or \"blacksmiths,\" and there are the usual\n\"catch-all\" codes for individuals who lack the information\nto enable them to be otherwise usefully classified.\nWhile the hierarchical structure closely guides the coding\nprocess, the opportunity has been taken to standardize cer-\ntain code components to facilitate the retrieval of individuals\nwith particular employment characteristics that may span\nmultiple occupations. For example, all titles that include the\nword \"helper\" or \"assistant\" end in the digit \"1\" at the lowest\nlevel. However, as an assistant master of machinery is a very\ndifferent level of job than a blacksmith's helper, the fixed\nnumber of digits in each code means that the simple applica-\ntion of a format mask to the code allows assistants in super-\nvisory posts to be distinguished easily from helpers in\nstandard trades. A similar convention applies to apprentices,\nall the codes of which end with the digit \"2.\" This approach\nequates to that used by Herschberg, but differs from HISCO,\nwhere such qualifying information would have to be found in\nthe separate STATUS code.\nOperational Use of the New Coding\nSystem\nAs noted at the outset, the new coding system is a key com-\nponent of a future process of what might be termed occupa-\ntional accuracy improvement for historical census data sets.\nThis is a long-term goal, which must be approached sys-\ntematically, if it is to have any likelihood of success. It will\nundoubtedly require work by a number of research groups\nand will increasingly deploy the methods of citizen science\nor crowd sourcing, whereby large numbers of individuals\ncontribute limited packages of work that amount in total to\na major research contribution. However, crowd sourcing\napproaches take time to establish and gather momentum. In\nthe interim, a pilot project has been launched by the present\nauthor, focused on major urban centers in the American\nManufacturing Belt, such as the cities of Cleveland, Ohio\nand Scranton and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania to examine\nthe potential for extracting additional information from city\ndirectories, and where available, company records, and\nmatching it to census records. As would be expected from\nthe foregoing, the emphasis is on the railroad, mining and\niron and steel sectors, which, to differing degrees, formed a\nmajor part of the industrial base of these and similar cities.\nThis combination of specific geographical locations and\nselected industrial sectors means that the resulting data sets\nwill be valuable in their own right as case study examples\nand become increasingly so, as the scope for comparability\nbetween cities and sectors grows over time. Further to this,\nas employment in these sectors was heavily concentrated in\nand around these cities in the Manufacturing Belt as late as\n1880 and beyond, these new data sets will progressively\ncreate growing collections of re-coded data. One of the\nfuture uses of these collections will be to determine the pos-\nsibility of applying correction factors to other data still to\nbe re-coded, to improve estimated findings based originally\non the latter. When re-coded occupational/industrial data\nare added in bulk to an existing census data warehouse, it\nwill also become possible to compare tabulations based on\nthe original codings with those based on the quality\nenhanced, re-coded data.\nPreliminary findings indicate the feasibility of abstracting\nmany thousands of new data records from city directories,\nthough accurate matching to census records is a resource-\nintensive process. It has also been found, as was anticipated,\nthat managing lengthy numerical codes in the course of man-\nual coding of directory and other data, is problematic for the\npersonnel involved, though the subsequent computational\nuse of the numerical codes is very straightforward and effec-\ntive. To bridge this operational gap, while retaining the con-\nsiderable database/data warehouse benefits of the numerical\ncodes, a structured set of mnemonic character abbreviations\nhas been devised, and the railroad sector is being used as a\nfirst test of their effectiveness. These abbreviations corre-\nspond to the relevant sections of numerical codes,\nso automated conversion can be undertaken, but unlike the\nlatter, early experience shows they are finding ready accep-\ntance for manual coding purposes. This is facilitated by the\nfact that a limited group of occupations, such as brakeman\n(mnemonic = rrb) and conductor (mnemonic = rrcn) in the\nrailroad sector, account for a significant proportion of all\nemployees, so the most frequently used mnemonic codes can\nbe memorized quickly through repetition. After testing is\ncompleted, these mnemonics and the conversion tables will\nbe made publicly available in the same way as has already\nbeen undertaken for the numerical codes, so other research\ngroups can utilize them if desired.\nConclusion\nThe system resolves the key shortcomings of the HISCO\ncoding system, by encompassing it within a much more\nsophisticated structure that allows comprehensive coding of\ndata from both census and non-census sources, to a level of\ndetail compatible with that provided in the original source\ndocuments. As it includes the HISCO codes, it maintains a\nvery high level of compatibility with that approach, yet\navoids the necessity for separate look-up tables, as provided\nby Wrigley for the PST system (Wrigley, n.d.). However, as\nWrigley has helpfully provided such tables, this also means\nthat a high degree of compatibility exists with that system\nalso, by deploying these intermediate tables in conjunction\nwith standard database queries. The new system has the\nimportant ability to standardize employment data from com-\npany payrolls and other industrial archives, as well as coding\ncensus and vital registration records. The fine breakdown of\nemployment characteristics that it provides offers a much\nmore nuanced approach to the analysis of inter-departmental,\ninter-sectoral, and geographical mobility than is possible\nusing other coding systems. A further important motivation\nfor its original development was to allow comparison of the\ndemographic characteristics of sub-populations of generic\nworkers in different industrial sectors and this capability has\nalready been demonstrated in a small case study in Baltimore\n(Healey et al., 2013). Further work on re-coding selected\ndata from the 1880 census in a data warehouse context is\nplanned to develop this approach on a larger scale.\nFuture Development of the Coding\nSystem\nWhile an exhaustive list of occupational titles for different\nU.S. industrial sectors in the 19th century is probably an\nunattainable goal, a very comprehensive list can eventually\nbe arrived at through comparison of multiple sources, both\nprinted and archival. While much of the groundwork for this\nhas been laid for the heavy industrial sectors, more can still\nbe achieved by incorporating data from two late 19th century\nsources. The first of these is the report of the Commissioner\nof Labor (1890), on railroad labor, which contains complete\nlists of job titles for a small sample of major railroad systems\nacross the country. While the vast majority of the common\ntitles listed in this source are already in the system, some of\nthe less common ones are not. The second is the Weeks\nReport and the associated database (Meyer, 2004; Weeks,\n1884), which contains a large number of job titles in different\nindustrial sectors, though it makes no claim of completeness.\nIdeally, more payroll information would also be incorpo-\nrated, although payrolls both for railroads and large iron/\nsteel works are surprisingly difficult to locate in any quantity\nfor the latter part of the 19th century (see Knowles (2013) for\nexamples of the use of earlier iron company records).\nAnother issue is that, over time, certain titles fell into dis-\nuse, or persisted in some regions but not others, or the nature\nof the work activity that they represented changed quite sig-\nnificantly, as technology moved forward. The original largely\nEuropean focus of the HISCO system raises further questions,\nas many U.S. occupational titles differed from their British\nequivalents (measured in terms of the tasks involved) or the\nEnglish translation of French or German terms may not cor-\nrespond to U.S. usage of the word in question. Hence, there is\na wider research agenda, not well-articulated in the literature,\nthan the narrower field of comparability between occupations\nrecorded in censuses internationally. As the new coding sys-\ntem aims to include original job titles, not a subset of standard-\nized categories, it also has the potential to act as an index to\nmore extensive textual resources that describe the \"task lists\"\nof apparently equivalent jobs in different companies, sectors,\nand locations and how these evolve or change over time. This\nwould be a useful extension to the helpful occupational\ndescriptions and illustrations already provided online for\nHISCO codes (History of Work Information System, 2013).\nSome progress in this direction has already been made, in\nterms of identifying published descriptions of railroad jobs in\na range of companies from the 1860s onward. While time-\nconsuming to develop such a textual resource, it is straightfor-\nward to link it directly to the online version of the coding\nsystem. This would also serve to encourage contributions from\nthe wider scholarly community to extend the resource, as this\nwould be of considerable value for future studies of work and\nlabor in the United States during the 19th century.\n"
