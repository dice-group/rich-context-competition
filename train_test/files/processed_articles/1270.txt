Using data from a large, nationally representative\nsurvey, the authors explored Black/White differences in serum selenium concentration.

Adjustment for known serum selenium predictors, including a proxy for\nresidence at the county level, reduced the racial disparity, although concentrations remained approximately 3%\nlower in Blacks than in Whites of both sexes (p < 0.0001). The observation that Blacks had lower unadjusted and\nadjusted serum selenium concentrations relative to Whites is intriguing, given the racial disparity in incidence of\nprostate cancer and other cancers.\nAfrican Americans; biological markers; neoplasms; nutrition surveys; selenium\nAbbreviations: NHANES III, Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; PIR, poverty index ratio; PSU, primary\nsampling unit.\nThe essential trace element selenium has been the focus\nof a number of recent scientific investigations because of its\nanticarcinogenic potential (1\u00ad3). Selenium is essential to the\nfunctioning of several enzymes, including the antioxidant\nenzyme glutathione peroxidase; it helps maintain a healthy\nimmune system and plays a role in many other aspects of\nhuman health (2).\nSelenium is found throughout the food supply. The richest\nsources are cereal grains, meats, and fish, although con-\ncentrations in food vary considerably according to the soil\ncontent of the geographic region where the food was pro-\nduced (4). In China, two endemic diseases, a type of car-\ndiomyopathy called Keshan disease and a type of deforming\narthritis called Kashin-Bek disease, have been attributed to\nselenium deficiency (2). Selenium intake that is sufficient\nto prevent these diseases may nevertheless be inadequate\nto reduce the risk of other diseases, most notably cancer\ninvestigators reported moderately strong inverse associa-\ntions between low regional levels of selenium and increased\ncancer incidence or mortality (9\u00ad11). Subsequently, obser-\nvational epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have pro-\nvided mixed but encouraging evidence that higher exposure\nto selenium, as measured in the blood, toenails, or diet, is\nassociated with a decreased risk of cancer, particularly\ncancer of the prostate but also lung and colorectal cancer\nCorrespondence to Dr. Tara M.

Relative to men of other\nracial/ethnic groups in the United States, Black men expe-\nrience the highest total cancer incidence and mortality rates\n(17). The greatest disparity is for prostate cancer, with in-\ncidence and mortality rates being 61 percent and 146 per-\ncent higher in Blacks than in Whites, respectively. Among\nwomen, cancer incidence is highest in Whites, mostly be-\ncause of higher breast cancer rates, whereas Black women\nlead other racial/ethnic groups in cancer mortality (17).\nRacial variation in serum selenium concentration may\nexplain some of the Black/White disparity in cancer rates.\nSuch variation has been previously reported, most notably\nin an analysis of data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) that focused\non the association between serum selenium levels and\ndemographic factors (18). Although those authors reported\nthat Blacks had significantly lower serum selenium levels\nrelative to Whites, they did not present results adjusted for\nthe influence of important predictors of serum selenium that\ncould potentially confound the racial differences. It was our\nobjective in this study to further investigate the Black/White\ndisparity in serum selenium levels using NHANES III data\nand adjusting for known predictors of serum selenium con-\ncentration, including location of residence at approximately\nStudy design and sampling technique\nIn this study, we used serologic and interview data from\nNHANES III, a national survey conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (Centers for Disease Control and\ndesigned to assess the health and nutritional status of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized US population aged 2 months\nor older.

We categorized age at interview into\nRegion of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West)\nwas used as a proxy for geographic location. Cigarette smok-\ning was quantified as the average number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day among current smokers. Never smokers\nwere defined as persons who had smoked fewer than 100\ncigarettes in their lifetime, while former smokers were per-\nsons who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime\nbut reported no current smoking. Alcohol intake was quan-\ntified as the average number of alcoholic drinks (i.e., a\nor a 1-ounce (30-ml) shot of liquor) consumed per week\namong current drinkers. Never drinkers were defined as per-\nsons who had consumed fewer than 12 drinks in their life-\ntime, while former drinkers were defined as those who had\nconsumed at least 12 drinks in their lifetime but reported no\ndrinking within the past 12 months.\nBody mass index, a measure of obesity defined as weight\nin kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was cat-\negorized according to clinical guidelines set by the National\nInstitutes of Health (36). The poverty index ratio (PIR) was\nused as a proxy for socioeconomic status. The PIR repre-\nsents reported total combined family income over the past\n12 months divided by the current federal poverty threshold\nfor a family of that size; a PIR of less than 1 is considered\npoverty (37). Dietary intake of selenium was derived from\nthe 24-hour dietary recall that was administered to partic-\nipants who underwent examination at a mobile examination\ncenter. The nutrient database of the University of Minnesota\nNutrition Coordinating Center was used to quantify selenium\nintake, which excluded supplementary selenium (38, 39);\nselenium intake can be interpreted as the total amount of\nselenium consumed on any given day.\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analyses for this study were performed\nusing SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North\nCarolina) and the SAS-callable version (version 9.0.0) of\nSUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, North Carolina), a statistical software package that\ntakes into account sample weighting and the complex,\nmultistage probability sample design of NHANES III. De-\nmographic characteristics were compared by race using chi-\nsquared tests. For each sex separately and for both sexes\ncombined, crude mean serum selenium concentrations were\ncalculated for persons who reported their race as either\nBlack or White.\nIn order to assess the degree to which various factors\nexplained the Black/White disparity in serum selenium con-\ncentration, four linear regression models were constructed\nwhich included known predictors of serum selenium\nRacial Differences in Serum Selenium Concentration 281\nconcentration (4, 18\u00ad25). For each sex separately and for\nboth sexes combined, the first model was adjusted for age\nonly; the second was additionally adjusted for current smok-\ning status, current alcohol consumption, body mass index,\nand PIR. Region of residence was added to the third model.\nBecause geographic location of residence is an important\npredictor of selenium intake (4), a fourth model was con-\nstructed that adjusted for NHANES III primary sampling\nunit (PSU) in addition to all of the variables used in the\nsecond model. The PSUs are sampled areas where the par-\nticipant resided and represent, in most cases, individual\ncounties or portions of large metropolitan areas, although\na few PSUs include adjacent counties. There were 98 PSUs\nin NHANES III. In our data set, each PSU contained, on\nin the regression analyses, we included a separate dummy\nvariable for each PSU. All p values were two-sided and\nwere considered statistically significant if they were less\nWe also assessed the associations between total dietary\nselenium intake and race and region, as well as the associ-\nation between serum selenium concentration and selenium\nintake.

For purposes of graphic presentation, the selenium\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the study population, weighted to rep-\nresent the US noninstitutionalized population, are presented\nin table 1. Whites had a higher male:female ratio and were\nolder than Blacks. The majority of Blacks lived in the South,\nwhereas Whites were more evenly dispersed throughout the\nregions. Blacks more often reported living in poverty rela-\ntive to Whites.\nPopulation density estimates (figures 1 and 2) illustrate\nthat, for both sexes, serum selenium concentrations were\nnoticeably shifted to lower concentrations in Blacks relative\nto Whites. This pattern was observed across most of the\nUnited States, as illustrated in figure 3, which includes un-\nadjusted mean values for Blacks and Whites in each of the\n67 PSUs that contained at least 10 members of each race.\nMean values are plotted on the x-axis for Blacks and on the\ny-axis for Whites. The points for a majority (93 percent) of\nPSUs fall above a 45\u00b0 line, indicating that Whites have\nhigher mean serum selenium concentrations than Blacks\nin most of the PSUs. This figure also shows a strong positive\nWhite serum selenium levels in the various PSUs.\nPrior to constructing statistical models to examine the\nassociation between serum selenium and race, we assessed\nthe association between serum selenium and potential con-\nfounders.

Although selenium intake was\nhigher among Whites (120.81 lg/day) than among Blacks\n(118.27 lg/day), this difference did not achieve statistical\nsignificance in either the crude model or the fully adjusted\nmodel that included PSU (p > 0.05). Dietary selenium was\nalso not associated with serum selenium in the crude models\nor in the models fully adjusted for all selenium predictors,\nincluding PSU, nor was it associated with region of resi-\ndence in the crude or fully adjusted (but without PSU)\nDISCUSSION\nSelenium has been hypothesized to play a role in prevent-\ning cancer (1\u00ad3). Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated\nan inverse association between circulating selenium levels\nand cancers of the prostate (12, 16), lung (14), and colorectum\n(13, 15). To date, the strongest evidence for a protective ef-\nfect comes from the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial,\na randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to\ntest the ability of selenium supplements (200 lg/day) to re-\nduce skin cancer incidence among 1,312 males and females\nliving in a US region with low soil levels of selenium (5, 7,\n8, 41\u00ad43). With respect to the skin cancer hypothesis, recent\nanalyses suggest that selenium supplementation actually in-\ncreases the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly\nsquamous cell carcinoma, among participants with higher\nbaseline serum selenium levels (44). However, secondary\nanalyses showed reductions in risk of other cancers, espe-\ncially prostate cancer; after approximately 4.5 years of treat-\nment and 7.5 years of follow-up, prostate cancer incidence\namong persons receiving selenium supplements was half\nthat experienced by the placebo group (p < 0.05). The Se-\nlenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT),\nanother large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled clinical\ntrial, recruited approximately 35,500 North American\nmales, approximately 15 percent of whom are Black. This\ntrial is designed to determine whether supplemental sele-\nnium and/or vitamin E decreases the risk of prostate cancer\nin healthy males and is expected to yield results by 2013\nThe mechanisms by which selenium may decrease cancer\nrisk were summarized by Rayman (47). Traditionally, it has\nbeen thought that the capacity of the selenoenzyme gluta-\nthione peroxidase to inactivate peroxides that can cause\ncellular damage may explain the importance of selenium\nin human carcinogenesis. However, glutathione peroxidase\nactivity is maximized at an intake of 55 lg/day, far below\nboth the average plasma selenium levels in the United States\nand the 200 lg/day given in the Nutritional Prevention of\nCancer Trial (41). A role in oxidant defense for a second\nselenoprotein, selenoprotein-P, has been suggested (48).\nHowever, a human supplementation trial demonstrated that\nselenoprotein-P levels did not increase after 16 weeks of se-\nand 600 lg/day, indicating that selenoprotein-P was opti-\nmized in selenium-replete persons (49).\nA third potential cancer prevention agent is selenium-\nmethylselenocysteine, which has been shown to have\nlow toxicity and to be the most effective seleno- compound\nin the prevention of mammary cancer in rats; selenium-\nmethylselenocysteine is the predominant form of selenium\nin selenium-enriched broccoli and garlic (3, 50\u00ad52). Ip et al.\n(53) reported on studies showing that methylseleninic acid,\na simplified version of selenium-methylselenocysteine\n(without the amino acid), inhibited cell proliferation and\ninduced apoptosis in a mouse mammary model.\nIf selenium does reduce cancer risk, racial differences in\ncirculating selenium levels might partially explain why can-\ncer incidence rates are higher among US Blacks than among\nUS Whites. Compared with White men, age-standardized\nincidence rates among Black men are substantially higher\nfor the three most commonly diagnosed cancers (lung, co-\nlon, and prostate); particularly striking is the fact that pros-\ntate cancer incidence rates are 61 percent higher in Black\nmen (17). Cancers of the colorectum and lung/bronchus are\n24 percent and 8 percent higher in Black women than in\nWhite women, respectively, but breast cancer incidence is\nlower (by 15 percent) in Black women compared with White\nIn our analysis of approximately 11,000 male and female\nNHANES III participants aged 12 years or older, Blacks had\nmean serum selenium values that were approximately 6 per-\ncent lower than those of Whites. Adjustment for lifestyle\nfactors identified in the literature to be predictors of sele-\nnium status only slightly attenuated this racial disparity.\nGeography, an indicator of local food and water supplies,\nwas a strong predictor. Adjustment for broad regional loca-\ntion of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West) sig-\nnificantly reduced racial disparity. Additional adjustment by\nthe NHANES III sampling variable, PSU, which more finely\nadjusts for geography at approximately the county level,\nreduced the crude Black/White disparity in mean serum\nselenium concentration by approximately half. Besides ad-\njusting for possible geographic differences in the selenium\ncontent of foods, PSU also adjusts for the month/season of\nthe year in which the serum samples were taken, since most\nsubjects from the same PSU were examined within a few\nweeks of each other. Adjusting for geography may also\ncontrol for unmeasured, locally determined lifestyle varia-\nbles that are related to both race and serum selenium level\n(e.g., local cultural and social differences that relate to di-\netary patterns) (54).\nRacial variation in selenium status has been reported pre-\nIII analysis that presented unadjusted serum selenium values\nby race and other demographic factors (18), other studies\nexamining racial differences in selenium status have been\nRacial Differences in Serum Selenium Concentration 285\nlimited by the inclusion of relatively few Blacks; most have\nreported blood selenium concentrations that were 5\u00ad10\nAn explanation for the racial disparities observed in this\nanalysis is not readily apparent. Selenium intake, based on\nthe NHANES III 24-hour dietary recall, was slightly higher\namong Whites than among Blacks, but this difference did\nnot achieve statistical significance. Lewis et al. (33) found\nno racial differences in selenium intake in a sample of ap-\nproximately 250 southern US Blacks and Whites. It is pos-\nsible that we were not able to demonstrate that differential\nintake of selenium-rich foods plays an important role in\nracial variation of serum selenium concentration because\nintakes were derived from a single 24-hour dietary recall,\nwhich probably contained significant measurement error.\nThus, dietary influences cannot be ruled out and should be\ninvestigated in future studies. Differential intake of sele-\nnium-containing dietary supplements may also be relevant,\nalthough Niskar et al. (18) found that only 11 percent of\nNHANES III participants reported taking such supplements;\nfurthermore, this behavior was not a predictor of serum\nselenium concentrations. Although we adjusted for the po-\ntentially confounding effect of many known and suspected\npredictors of serum selenium, it is possible that an unknown\nfactor could explain the variation. Finally, genetic factors\nthat may correlate with race could differentially affect sele-\nnium absorption and metabolism and thus serum selenium\nWhile the absolute difference between racial groups is\nrelatively small, it may nonetheless be of public health sig-\nnificance. An earlier NHANES III analysis indicated that the\nUS population does not appear to be at risk of selenium\ndeficiency or toxicity (24). Our analysis also revealed that\nnearly all (>99.5 percent) of our study population had se-\nrum selenium concentrations that were considered nutrition-\nally optimal (>80 ng/ml) (60). However, selenium levels\nthat do not produce signs of clinical deficiency could be\nsuboptimal and could adversely affect cancer risk (1, 5\u00ad8).\nFor example, updated reports from the Nutritional Preven-\ntion of Cancer Trial (5, 7, 8, 43) indicate that only partic-\nipants entering the trial with baseline serum selenium levels\nng/ml experienced a protective effect from selenium supple-\nmentation. Participants with higher baseline values showed\nno benefit from supplementation, and some subanalyses\neven indicated increased cancer risk among such selenium-\nreplete persons, suggesting the existence of a threshold level\nof benefit and perhaps safety (47). Among our subjects,\na larger proportion of Blacks (56 percent) than of Whites\n(36 percent) had serum selenium concentrations below\nOur study had several strengths and limitations. The un-\nusually large number of participants drawn from a represen-\ntative sample of noninstitutionalized US Blacks and Whites\nenabled us to generate stable and generalizable estimates of\nmean serum selenium concentration. Additionally, many\nlifestyle factors known to predict serum selenium levels\nwere measured in NHANES III, allowing us to adjust for\ntheir potentially confounding influences. In particular, be-\ncause of the geographically clustered sample design of\nNHANES III, we had the rare opportunity to adjust for lo-\ncation of residence at approximately the county level. Lim-\nitations include the potential misclassification that may\nresult from the use of a single measurement of serum se-\nlenium. However, it has been demonstrated that a single\nmeasurement can reasonably rank subjects according to\nlong-term dietary intake of selenium (61). We also had to\nrely on a single 24-hour recall to estimate dietary intake of\nselenium. This method of dietary assessment is known to\nhave large day-to-day within-person variability, which re-\nsults in attenuated associations and reduced statistical power\n(62). Additionally, the use of standard recipe and food com-\nposition databases adds to the measurement error in deter-\nmining selenium intake from dietary instruments such as\na 24-hour dietary recall (62). In addition to potential validity\nissues regarding the instrument itself, the measurement of\ndietary selenium is known to be challenging, because the\nselenium content in food varies according to the selenium\ncontent of the soil where the food originated (4). We were\nalso unable to evaluate certain subtleties related to selenium\nintake, such as the fact that different sources of selenium\n(e.g., plant sources vs. animal sources) vary in physiologic\nrelevance and also result in different serum selenium\nconcentrations (63).\nIn conclusion, using nationally representative data from\nNHANES III, we observed substantial variation in circulat-\ning selenium levels in Black men and women versus White\nmen and women. Crude and adjusted mean serum selenium\nconcentrations were significantly lower among Blacks than\namong Whites, with differences being apparent for both\nsexes. Low intake of selenium has been suggested as a po-\ntential risk factor for several major cancers. It is provocative\nthat, relative to US Whites, US Blacks have both lower\nconcentrations of serum selenium and higher incidence rates\nof cancer overall and cancers of the prostate, colorectum,\nand lung. Particularly intriguing are the high prostate cancer\nincidence rates observed among Blacks and the relatively\nstrong evidence for an inverse association between prostate\ncancer and selenium exposure. Although the absolute dif-\nference in serum selenium concentrations between Blacks\nand Whites was small, this observation deserves further in-\nvestigation, since it could potentially translate into a cancer\nprevention strategy.\n"
