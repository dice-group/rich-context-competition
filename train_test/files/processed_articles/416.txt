Here, we investigated POPs and insulin resistance, a frequent pathogenic\nprecursor of type 2 diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Serum POPs and homeostasis model assess-\nment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were investigated cross-sectionally in 749 nondiabetic\nparticipants aged 20 years. Nineteen POPs in five subclasses were selected, detectable in 60%\nof participants.\nRESULTS -- Among subclasses, OC pesticides were most strongly associated with HOMA-IR.\nquartiles of OC pesticides. The relationship strengthened with increasing HOMA-IR percentile:\nadjusted odds ratios comparing the highest versus lowest POPs quartile were 1.8 for being\ncentile. Associations with elevated HOMA-IR appeared to be specific to oxychlordane and\ntrans-nonachlor but also were found for two nondioxin-like PCBs. No HOMA-IR associations\nwere seen in the other three POP subclasses. The association between OC pesticides and\nHOMA-IR tended to strengthen as waist circumference increased, with no apparent association\nin the lowest quartile of OC pesticide concentrations.\nCONCLUSIONS -- These findings, coupled with those concerning diabetes prevalence,\nsuggest that OC pesticides and nondioxin-like PCBs may be associated with type 2 diabetes risk\nby increasing insulin resistance, and POPs may interact with obesity to increase the risk of type\n2 diabetes.\nRecently, we reported striking dose-\nresponse relations between serum\nconcentrations of persistent organic\npollutants (POPs) and prevalence of dia-\nbetes in a random sample of the U.S pop-\nulation with background environmental\nexposure to POPs (1). Even though all six\nPOPs (detectable among at least 80% of\nstudy subjects) were associated positively\nwith diabetes, the POPs belonging to sub-\nclasses organochlorine (OC) pesticides\n(trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane) or\nnondioxin-like polychlorinated biphe-\nnyls (PCBs) (PCB153) were most strongly\nassociated with diabetes, with odds ratios\n(ORs) for prevalent diabetes for those in\nthe top decile of detectables compared\nrespectively. Furthermore, the prevalence\nof diabetes was quite low among subjects\nin the lowest category of POPs, even in\ngesting that POPs stored in adipose tissue\nmay contribute strongly to the pathogen-\nesis of diabetes (2,3).\nVirtually all patients with type 2 dia-\nbetes are insulin resistant (4), and in-\ncreased insulin resistance normally\nprecedes the onset of diabetes by one to\ntwo decades (5,6). Thus, if the strong as-\nsociations of POPs with diabetes shown in\nour previous study were causal, it would\nbe reasonable to expect similar relations\nbetween POPs and insulin resistance,\neven in the pre-diabetic stage, as we re-\nported for POPs and diabetes prevalence.\nThus, we investigated the relation of se-\nrum concentrations of POPs with insulin\nresistance among nondiabetic subjects\nusing the same dataset as in our previous\nstudy (1).\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) conducted by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion were designed to be nationally repre-\nsentative of the noninstitutionalized, U.S.\ncivilian population on the basis of a com-\n                                                \nFrom the 1Department of Preventive Medicine and Health Promotion Research Center, School of Medicine,\nKyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea; the 2Department of Endocrinology, School of Medicine,\nKyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea; the 3Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology,\nUniversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota; the 4Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health,\nUniversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and the 5Department of Nutrition, University of Oslo,\nOslo, Norway.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Duk-Hee Lee, MD, PhD, Department of Preventive\nMedicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook University, 101 Dongin-dong, Jung-gu, Daegu, Korea 700-422.\nE-mail: lee_dh@knu.ac.kr.\nAbbreviations: HOMA-IR, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; LOD, limit of detection;\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; OC, organochlorine; PCB, polychlorinated\nbiphenyl; PCDD, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin; PCDF, polychlorinated dibenzofurans; POP, persistant\norganic pollutant.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syste\n`me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\n\u00a9 2007 by the American Diabetes Association.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

Venous\nblood samples were collected and shipped\nweekly at 20\u00b0C. POPs were measured by\nhigh-resolution gas chromatography/high-\nresolution mass spectrometry using iso-\ntope dilution for quantification. All these\nanalytes were measured in 5 ml of se-\nrum using a modification of the method of\nTurner et al. (10). The POPs were re-\nported on a lipid-adjusted basis using\nconcentrations of serum total cholesterol\nand triglycerides. Plasma glucose was\nmeasured with a hexokinase enzymatic\nreference method (COBAS MIRA; Roche\nDiagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and serum\ninsulin by means of a radioimmunoassay\n(Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Swe-\nden). Insulin resistance was estimated us-\ning the homeostasis model assessment\n(HOMA) method calculated by the fol-\nlowing equation: (fasting insulin [mU/l]\n fasting glucose [mmol/l]/22.5).\nAlthough 49 POPs were measured in\nthose below the limit of detection (LOD),\nwe selected the 19 POPs for which at least\n60% of study subjects had concentrations\nmore than the LOD: three polychlori-\nnated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), three\npolychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs),\nfour dioxin-like PCBs, five nondioxin-like\nPCBs, and four OC pesticides. There were\nwith information on both fasting morning\nsamples and serum concentrations of the\nsubjects who had diabetes, the final sam-\nFor each POP, subjects with serum\nconcentrations under the LOD were re-\ngarded as the reference group and subjects\nwith detectable values were categorized\npercentile values. To yield a cumulative\nmeasure of three PCDDs, we summed the\nranks of the three POPs that belong to the\nPCDDs. The summary values were cate-\nand 75th percentile values. We assigned\nand cumulated POP subclasses similarly\nfor the three PCDFs, the four dioxin-like\nPCBs, the five nondioxin-like PCBs, and\nthe four OC pesticides.\nIn the previous study (1), we selected\nthe six POPs that were detected among\n80% of study subjects because the selec-\ntion of a true reference group with truly\nlow levels of POPs would be very impor-\ntant to get valid risk estimates. As all six\nPOPs were positively associated with dia-\nbetes, we combined the ranks of the six\nPOPs to calculate a summary marker of\nsix POPs. However, it would be more rea-\nsonable to summarize only POPs with\nsimilar physical and chemical properties\n(i.e., specific POPs belonging to the same\nsubclasses of POPs). For this purpose, we\nselected 19 POPs that were detected\namong at least 60% of study subjects and\nexamined the associations of POPs and\nHOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)\nwithin five POP subclasses. As a last step,\nwe analyzed specific POPs belonging to\nthose subclasses of POPs that were signif-\nicantly associated with HOMA-IR.\nIt is important to note that subjects\nwith serum concentrations under the\nLOD of a specific POP do not necessarily\nhave zero values. They were nondetect-\nable due to limited amounts of serum\nused for POP measurement. If sufficient\namounts of serum were used, POPs\nwould be detectable in almost all humans.\nHowever, as it is unlikely that the amount\nof serum used for POP measurement dif-\nfers depending on their actual serum lev-\nels of POPs, we could assume that on\naverage true serum concentrations of\nPOPs among subjects with nondetectable\nPOPs were lower than those among sub-\njects with detectable POPs.\nFirst, the associations of categories of\nPOPs with HOMA were analyzed using\nlinear regression with continuous loga-\nrithmic-transformed HOMA-IR values.\nNext, we assessed whether HOMA-IR dif-\nferences across POP categories expanded\nat the higher percentiles of HOMA-IR. To\ndo this, we estimated the OR of having\nHOMA-IR above a series of cut points\nacross categories of POPs. The HOMA-IR\ncut points considered were the 50th per-\nThe use of several cutoffs allowed us to\nlook at whether the HOMA-IR/POP associ-\nation got stronger as HOMA-IR increased.\nPotential confounders were age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, poverty income ratio, BMI,\nwaist circumference, cigarette smoking\n(never, former, or current), cotinine con-\ncentrations (ng/ml), alcohol consumption\n(g/day), and leisure time physical activity\n(vigorous, moderate, or none).

As results were very similar with\nresults based on SAS 9.1.\nRESULTS -- The sample of 749 partic-\ngest and most important correlate of se-\nrum concentrations of all five subclasses\nof POPs with correlation coefficients from\nwere positive pairwise correlations\namong serum concentrations of the five\nsubclasses of POPs with correlation coef-\nserum concentrations of PCDDs and di-\noxin-like PCBs.

Among other POPs, both PCDDs\nand nondioxin-like PCBs showed positive\ntrends even though they failed to reach\nstatistical significances. When we used\nlower cutoff points of HOMA-IR, such as\n75th percentile or 50th percentile, only\nOC pesticides were significantly associ-\nated with HOMA-IR, but the strengths of\nassociations tended to be weaker than\nthose of 90th percentile. When all five\nsubclasses of POPs were included in one\nmodel, only OC pesticides were significant.\nAmong four specific POPs belonging\nto OC pesticides, both oxychlordane and\ntrans-nonachlor were most strongly asso-\nciated with the risk of elevated HOMA-IR\n(Table 3). When we further investigated\neight POPs belonging to nondioxin-like\nPCBs or PCDDs (which showed nonsig-\nnificant positive trends with the outcome\nof HOMA-IR 90th percentile), both\nassociated with HOMA-IR. On the other\nhand, three specific POPs (PCB153,\nibenzo-p-dioxin) positively associated\nwith diabetes in a previous study (1) were\nnot significantly associated with HOMA-IR.\nIn all analyses, we further considered\nself-reported weight loss in the 1 or 10\nyears before examination as possible con-\nfounders because weight loss was a strong\nconfounder in the associations between\nPOPs and diabetes in our previous study\n(13). However, the adjustment for weight\nloss did not change the results (data not\nshown).\nWe examined the interaction be-\ntween POPs and waist circumference on\nthe risk for insulin resistance, which was\nmotivated by an apparent interaction be-\ntween POPs and BMI on the risk of prev-\nalent diabetes in our previous study (1).\nSimilar to those findings, Fig. 1 shows\nthat the association between serum con-\ncentrations of OC pesticides and the risk\nof higher HOMA-IR tended to be stronger\nas waist circumference increased even\nthough the P for interaction was not sig-\nnificant (P for interaction  0.58). Inter-\nestingly, waist circumference was not\nassociated with elevated HOMA-IR\namong subjects with low concentrations\nof OC pesticides.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Using a cross-\nsectional design, the present study found\nserum concentrations of OC pesticides to\nbe strongly and positively associated with\ninsulin resistance among nondiabetic\nsubjects. Coupled with the findings of our\nprevious study on the associations be-\ntween POPs and diabetes (1), the current\nresults suggest that the background envi-\nronmental exposure to some POPs, espe-\ncially OC pesticides, may be critically\ninvolved in the pathogenesis of diabetes\nthrough a pathway involving insulin re-\nsistance. Among several OC pesticides,\nboth oxychlordane (metabolites of chlor-\ndane) and trans-nonachlor (impurity of\nchlordane) were most strongly associated\nwith insulin resistance. On the other\nhand, other classes of POPs, such as\nPCDDs, PCDF, or PCBs, were not\nstrongly associated with insulin resistance\namong nondiabetic subjects. However,\nwhen specific individual POPs were ex-\namined, some POPs belonging to non-\ndioxin-like PCBs were associated with\nhigher values of HOMA-IR.\nIn our previous study on the associa-\ntion between POPs and diabetes (1), we\nreported strong dose-response relations\nof diabetes with all six POPs studied,\nwhich included members of the sub-\nclasses of PCDDs, nondioxin-like PCBs,\nand OC pesticides. Serum concentrations\nof most POPs in the general population\nare highly correlated each other. Thus, we\ncautioned that the six specific POPs that\nwere strongly associated with diabetes\nmay not be themselves causally related to\ndiabetes, but we thought it was likely that\neither these six POPs or others highly cor-\nrelated with them could be causally asso-\nciated with diabetes (1). Although it was\nnot stated in our previous study (1), it is\ninteresting to note that trans-nonachlor\nwas most strongly associated with diabe-\nTable 1--Adjusted* geometric means and SEs of HOMA-IR by quartiles of PCDDs, PCDFs, dioxin-like PCBs, nondioxin-like PCBs, and OC\npesticides\nAnalyte\nGeometric means  SEs of HOMA-IR\nPtrend\nDioxin-like PCBs\nNondioxin-like PCBs\nOC pesticides\n*Model 1: Adjusted for age, sex, race, and poverty income ratio.

The consistency of the patterns is\nthought provoking, even though the for-\nmal tests for interaction were not signifi-\ncant; the pattern leads to our hypothesis\nthat the toxicity of POPs related to the risk\nof both insulin resistance and diabetes\nmay substantially increase as people get\nfatter. Additionally, they suggest (but do\nnot prove) that obesity may not be a suf-\nficient cause of type 2 diabetes.\nAmong limitations, the cross-\nsectional study design in the NHANES\ndoes not allow inferences regarding the\ntemporality of events and the causality be-\ntween POPs and insulin resistance. Sec-\nond, misclassification bias is possible for\nsubjects whose POPs would have been\ndetectable with a higher sample volume.\nSuch misclassification would be nondif-\nferential if sample volume is unrelated to\nHOMA-IR. Third, HOMA-IR is a surro-\ngate but is highly correlated with insulin\nresistance measured using the euglyce-\nmic-hyperinsulinemic clamp method\n(20). Finally, inferences should be made\ncautiously in light of the multiple com-\nparisons made, even given the strong\nagreement between the present findings\nand those related to prevalent type 2 dia-\nbetes (1).\nIn summary, along with our previous\nfinding on the association between POPs\nand diabetes, our current study raises par-\nticular suspicion that OC pesticides and\nnondioxin-like PCBs may be involved in\nthe pathogenesis of insulin resistance,\nwhich may explain part of the excess risk\nfor diabetes, associated with POPs more\ngenerally. Especially, the interaction be-\ntween OC pesticides and obesity on the\nrisk of insulin resistance and diabetes sug-\ngests that POPs stored in adipose tissue\nmay play a role in the current epidemic of\ntype 2 diabetes.\n"
