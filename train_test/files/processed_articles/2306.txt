Data on injury-related visits were obtained\nfrom a national sample of 66 of 100 NEISS hospitals,\nwhich were selected as a stratified probability sample of\nhospitals in the USA with a minimum of six beds and 24 h\nEDs. Data are weighted by the inverse of the probability of\nselection to produce national estimates. The sample\nincludes separate strata for very large, large, medium and\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits\nper hospital. Data obtained on each case include age,\nrace/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body\npart affected, consumer products involved, disposition at\nED discharge (ie, hospitalised, transferred, treated and\nreleased, observation and died), locale where the injury\noccurred, work-relatedness and a narrative description of\nthe injury circumstances, also, major categories of external\ncause of injury (eg, motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poi-\nsoning and fire/burn) and of intent of injury (eg, uninten-\ntional, assault, intentional self-harm and legal\nintervention). Trained, onsite hospital coders took data for\ninjury-related cases from ED records at NEISS hospitals.\nThe coders coded all data elements, except for cause of\ninjury. These coded data and a narrative were electronic-\nally transmitted to Consumer Product Safety Commission\n(CPSC) headquarters. NEISS-AIP quality assurance coders\nat CPSC headquarters reviewed all of the data elements as\nwell as a narrative (description) for each case from each of\nthe 66 NEISS-AIP hospitals. Quality assurance coders then\nused the narrative and other data to assign codes for the\nprecipitating and direct causes/mechanisms of injury for\neach case. The present study included persons 65 years or\nolder treated in US hospital EDs for unintentional fall-\nmates are considered unstable and potentially unreliable if\nthe number of records is based on fewer than 20\nNEISS-AIP cases, national estimates fewer than 1200\n(based on weighted data) or the coefficient of variation of\nthe estimate is greater than 30%. The NEISS-AIP public\nuse files were downloaded from the Inter-University\nConsortium for Political and Social Research.9\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS\nComplex Sample software, V.17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago,\nIllinois, USA) and incorporated population-based sam-\npling weights to obtain unbiased, nationally representa-\ntive estimates from the NEISS-AIP sampling design. The\nsample weight has been adjusted for hospital non-\nresponse within each NEISS-AIP sample stratum and\nchanges in the number of ED visits annually in the sam-\npling frame of US hospital EDs. Means and proportions\nwere used to describe demographic and clinical charac-\nteristics of the study sample. The US Census Bureau\npopulation estimates were used as the denominator to\nFracture rates were then standardised by the direct\nmethod to the US population for the year 2000 to\naccount for changes in the age distribution of the popu-\nlation over time. Linear regression was used to examine\nthe statistical significance of trends in fall-related frac-\nture rates over the study period. The results are pre-\nsented as the annual percentage change in rates and\ncorresponding 95% CI. The annual percentage change\nis one way to characterise trends over time in which the\nrates are assumed to change at a constant percentage of\nthe rate of the previous year.

In fact, lower\ntrunk fractures in women accounted for 28% of all fall-\nrelated fractures among older adults treated in EDs\nduring the 8-year period. The present findings are con-\nsistent with a report from the Healthcare Cost and\nUtilization Project Nationwide Emergency Department\nSample on ED injury visits among older adults in which\nwomen were more likely to have ED visits for upper\nextremity and hip fractures than older men. In addition,\nwomen were two to three times more likely than men to\nhave a fall-related ED visit for most types of fracture.\nOverall, hospitalisation occurred in 51.3% of older\nadults with a fall-related fracture ED visit.12 Similarly, a\nrecent study using data from the NEISS-AIP showed that\nfall-related forearm and wrist fracture rates among\npersons 50 years or older treated in hospital EDs nation-\nwide were on average 3.3 higher in women than those\nrates in men.13 Possible explanations for the marked\ngender differences in fractures are the higher preva-\nlence of osteopenia and osteoporosis among women\nand the 40\u00ad60% higher fall-related injury rates reported\nFigure 1 Fall-related fracture\nrates and 95% CI among older\nadults treated in US emergency\ndepartments.\nFigure 2 Trends in fall-related\nfracture rates treated in US\nFall-related fractures among older adults\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nThe racial differences in fall-related fracture rates\nfound in this study are also consistent with results from\nprevious investigations in which white women had the\nhighest fracture rates, whereas black and Asian women\nhad the lowest fracture rates.15 16 Although many risk\nfactors for fracture have been identified in white\nwomen, less is known about risk factors for fracture in\nwomen aged 50\u00ad79 years enrolled in the Women's\nHealth Initiative study, three risk factors common to all\nracial groups were older age, positive history of prior\nfracture after the age of 55 years and a positive history of\ntwo or more falls.14 17 Among fallers, an increasing\namount of leisure-time physical activity and wearing\nproper shoes with low, wide heels that cover and stay on\nthe foot in the event of a fall have been associated with\ndecreased risk of fractures at the foot, distal forearm,\nproximal humerus, pelvis and shaft of the tibia/fibula\ncompared with fallers who do not fracture.18 Moreover,\namong older white women, walking for exercise, redu-\ncing caffeine intake, quitting smoking, avoiding long-\nacting sedatives agents, treating impaired vision and pre-\nserving bone mass were reported to reduce the risk of\nSeveral studies have reported that fractures of the hip,\nspine or wrist are predictors of subsequent fractures.20\u00ad23\nRecently, investigators have demonstrated that besides\ntypical osteoporotic fractures, prior non-hip and non-\nspine fractures in both genders are associated with the\nincidence of traditional fragility fractures, as well as with\nfractures of the humerus and tibia/fibula.20 Moreover,\nprior rib and upper leg fracture fractures are associated\nwith increased risk of subsequent vertebral and hip frac-\nture, respectively. Among women, a history of ankle\nfracture increased the risk of future fracture of a weight-\nOf interest, 44.2% of patients treated in EDs for fall-\nrelated fracture required hospitalisation and the propor-\ntion of older adults hospitalised for these injuries\nincreased during the 8-year study period. Although the\npresent analysis was limited to fall-related fractures, these\nfindings are consistent with a recent study that reported\nan increase by 50% in the estimated number of fall-related\nhospitalisations among older adults in the USA between\naccounted for 63% of the diagnoses.4 Similarly, fractures\nwere the most common admitting diagnosis among\npersons aged 65 years or older hospitalised for fall-related\n84% of the admissions.5 Moreover, fall-related injury hospi-\ntalisation rates increased in both genders during the\nOverall, the number of fall-related fractures among\nolder adults treated in EDs increased between 2001 and\n2008. After age adjustment, a non-significant upward\ntrend in fall-related fracture rates was seen among men.\nThe precise reason for this finding is unknown. However,\ndifferences in osteoporosis recommendations for screen-\ning and prevention between men and women may\naccount for increasing fall-related fracture rates seen\namong men.24 These results contrast with a previous study\namong Medicare beneficiaries that reported a significant\ndecrease in hip fracture rates among men and women\nThe increased proportion of older Americans with phys-\nical limitations (stooping, lifting, reaching, grasping and\nwalking) over time may also partly explain these findings.\nIn fact, data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary\nFigure 3 Disposition of older\nadults treated in US hospital\nemergency departments for\nfall-related fracture.\nFall-related fractures among older adults\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nSurvey indicate that the age-adjusted proportion of non-\ninstitutionalised adults aged 65 years and older with phys-\nNational Health and Nutritional Examination Survey\ndemonstrated an increased prevalence of self-reported dis-\nability over time among older Americans in basic activities\nof daily living, instrumental activities of daily living and\nmobility.26 Disability of the lower extremities has been asso-\nciated with increased risk for falls among those aged\n75 years or older living in the community and with fall-\nrelated hip fracture in women.6 27 Moreover, adequate\nphysical activity has been associated with a reduced risk of\nfractures among fallers, possibly because physical activity\ncan increase physical functioning, maintain mobility,\nincrease muscle strength and balance, improve bone\nmineral density and improve reaction time.18\nSeveral limitations of this study must be mentioned in\ninterpreting the present findings. First, the number of fall-\nrelated fractures among older adults may be underesti-\nmated because it includes only those persons who were\ntreated in hospital EDs; the NEISS-AIP does not include\npersons treated in a physician's office or other outpatient\nsettings. Second, some fractures may have been missed\nbecause the NEISS-AIP includes the principal diagnosis\nand primary body part noted during the initial injury visit.\nIn cases with multiple injuries, data for only the most\nsevere injury are recorded. Third, the NEISS-AIP coding\nsystem has a fixed number of categories for the primary\nbody part affected and for the principal diagnosis relevant\nto consumer\u00adproduct-related injuries. ICD-9-CM diagnosis\ncodes were not available in the medical records at the time\nthese data were collected; therefore, specific types of injur-\nies (eg, hip fracture) could not be accurately identified.3\nFourth, the present findings may be generalised to hos-\npital ED visits for fall-related injuries among older adults\nin the USA. However, regional or fracture rates by state\ncannot be determined. Finally, the NEISS-AIP does not\nevaluate healthcare services and medical outcomes after\nthis type of injury.\nDespite these limitations, this study describes the\ndemographic characteristics and incidence of fall-related\nfractures nationwide among older adults treated in hos-\npital EDs. Since the population of 65 years and older in\nthe US will increase more than double by 2050, rising\nfrom 39 million today to 89 million, these demographic\nchanges alone will increase the number of fall-related\nfractures unless interventions to prevent falls among\nolder adults are effectively implemented.28 Although\nspecific interventions on modifiable risk factors among\nolder adults have shown to markedly decrease the preva-\nlence of falls, healthcare providers should recommend\nexercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementa-\ntion to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults\nwho are at increased risk of falling.27 29\nIn conclusion, the oldest old, women and lower trunk\nfractures account for the majority of fall-related fractures\nhospital ED visits among persons aged 65 years or older\nin the USA. Increasing ED visits and hospitalisations for\nfall-related fracture among older adults deserve further\nresearch.\n"
