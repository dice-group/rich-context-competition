Studies published so far have\nbeen case\u00adcontrol studies and hence vulnerable to bias\nintroduced by cohort effects. In this study we extended\nthe previous findings in the cohorts of oldest old Danes\nDanes (N = 736), applying a longitudinal study design as\nwell as the case\u00adcontrol study design. Fifteen SNPs were\nchosen in order to cover the known common variation in\nFOXO3A. Comparing SNP frequencies in the oldest old\nwith middle-aged individuals, we found association (after\ncorrection for multiple testing) of eight SNPs; 4\nously reported to be associated with longevity and four\nfound association of the haplotypes TAC and CAC of\napplying a longitudinal study design; when using follow-\nup survival data on the oldest old in a longitudinal analysis,\nwe found no SNPs to remain significant after the\ncorrection for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction).\nHence, our results support and extent the proposed role\nof FOXO3A as a candidate longevity gene for survival\nfrom younger ages to old age, yet not during old age.\nKey words: human longevity; Forkhead box O3A\n(FOXO3A); association study; case\u00adcontrol and longitudi-\nnal data.\nIntroduction\nGenetic factors contribute to the variation in human life span by\nbelieved to be minimal before age 60 years and most profound\nfrom age 85 years onwards (Hjelmborg et al. 2006). Candidate\nlongevity genes encode proteins involved in several biological\nprocesses including the insulin / IGF-1 signaling pathway (Chris-\ntensen et al. 2006), in which the transcription factor forkhead\nbox O3A (Foxo3a) is of key importance.\nVariation in the gene encoding Foxo3a (FOXO3A) has previ-\nously been reported to be associated with human longevity.\nWillcox et al. (2008) first reported on the associations of\nFOXO3A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with longevity\n(P < 0.0001)), associations which were subsequently confirmed\n(with effects pointing in the same direction) in Italian, American\n(northern and western European ancestry), Chinese and Ger-\n6 of 16 tagging SNPs (five specific to males and one to females)\n(both genders) (Li et al. 2009) to be associated with longevity.\nFurthermore, two studies reported on the associations of\nFOXO3A haplotypes with longevity (Anselmi et al. 2009; Li et al.\nThe studies published so far have been case\u00adcontrol stud-\nies (comparing oldest old to younger controls), raising con-\ncerns about possible cohort effects introducing bias\nwe aimed to add further support and to extend the evidence\nfor a role of FOXO3A in longevity by investigating 15\nFOXO3A SNPs covering the known common genetic variation\nin FOXO3A in two populations of middle-aged and oldest\nold Danes, applying the case\u00adcontrol study design (middle-\naged versus oldest old) as well as a longitudinal study design\n(oldest old only).\nCorrespondence\nMette Soerensen, The Danish Aging Research Center, Epidemiology, Insti-\ntute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, J.B.

All 15 FOXO3A SNPs were in Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilib-\nrium in the control group (P > 0.05 / 15 SNPs) (data not shown).\nThe genotype and allele frequencies of the 15 SNPs for middle-\naged controls, nonagenarians, centenarians, and the combined\ngroup of oldest old (nonagenarians + centenarians) are listed in\nSupporting information Table S1. The frequencies of the rare\nalleles and rare genotypes generally tended to be higher in the\noldest old when compared to the middle-aged controls. One\ncommon allele and genotype was higher in the oldest old than\nin the controls. The frequencies for the nonagenarians were in\ngeneral in between the frequencies for the middle-aged control\ngroup and the centenarians, supporting an increase in allele and\ngenotype frequencies with age. Stratification by sex indicated\nthat these tendencies were most pronounced for males (data\nnot shown).\nFOXO3A SNPs and longevity \u00ad Case\u00adcontrol analysis\nP-values for the allelic frequency case\u00adcontrol comparisons\n(PCCA) and the genotype frequency case\u00adcontrol comparisons\n(PCCG) between the middle-aged and oldest old cohort are\nlisted in Supporting information Table S2; results for nominally\nsignificant effects (P < 0.05) are listed in Table 1.

How-\never, more and more data points to the FOXO3A gene as the\nnext convincing longevity candidate gene.\nIn this study, we investigated the possible association of varia-\ntion in the FOXO3A gene with human longevity by covering the\nknown common genetic variation of FOXO3A using tagging\nSNPs and analyzing the frequency data both by a case\u00adcontrol\nand by a longitudinal approach.\nFirst, we conducted case\u00adcontrol analyses and found [as seen\nthat the frequencies of the rare alleles and rare genotypes\ntended to be increased in the oldest old when compared to the\nyounger controls (see Supporting information Table S1). One\nand most frequent genotype were increased in the oldest old.\nThis was also observed by Flachsbart et al. (2009). Moreover, as\nTable 3 Case-control association analysis of FOXO3A haplotypes with longevity.

Soerensen et al.\nAging Cell \u00aa 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland\nreported by Flachsbart et al., we found that the allele and geno-\ntype frequencies for the nonagenarians in our cohort were gen-\nerally in between the frequencies for the younger controls and\nfor the centenarians, supporting the reported increase in allele\nand genotype frequencies with age.\nWhen conducting association studies by comparing allele fre-\nquencies between the younger controls and oldest old, we\nfound nominally significantly differences between the oldest old\nSNP (rs479744) was significantly different between centenarians\nand controls when analyzing both genders combined (see\nTable 1 and Supporting information Table S2). Of these six\nbeen found to be associated with longevity at the allele level\n(after correction of multiple testing) in at least one previous\n(Flachsbart et al. 2009). The associations of the SNPs point in\nthe same direction as in previously published studies (the SNPs\nshow an increase in frequency of the rare allele in old age,\nincreased in the oldest old (see Supporting information\nTable S1)) supporting the findings. The associations with respect\nto allele frequencies did in our study, however, not hold after\ncorrection for multiple testing (see Supporting information\nTable S3). The fact that at the allelic level, our data does not\nhold for the correction of multiple testing might simply be a\nmatter of sample size and hence lack of power to detect an\nassociation. However, our sample size is at least as large as the\npreviously published studies. Moreover, as seen below, assum-\ning a recessive model for the genotype frequency data generally\ngives the lowest PGGC values, indicating that the association\neffect is most pronounced for the rare homozygote individuals,\nand hence that the association effect might be `masked' when\nanalyzing the allele frequencies (that is the heterozygotes might\n`dilute' the effect).\nWhen comparing genotype frequencies, all SNPs except\nwas significant only for the centenarians), see Supporting infor-\nmation Tables S2 and Table 1. Nine of these 12 SNPs (excluding\nbe in pronounced LD at these SNPs, have previously been\nreported to be associated at the genotype level in at least one\nAfter correction for multiple testing (see Supporting informa-\ntion Table S3 and Table 2), 8 of the 12 SNPs remained signifi-\npreviously been reported to be associated (after correction for\nmultiple testing) in at least one study (Flachsbart et al. 2009;\nthe lowest PGGC values, indicating that the association effects\nmay be most pronounced for the rare homozygotes, possibly\non the other hand, shows significance only when applying the\ndominant model, indicating that the positive effect of this SNP\nis most pronounced for individuals holding the common allele.\ncant findings in the populations composed of both genders.\nHowever, as seen in Table 1, 2, and 3, the differences in allele,\ngenotype and haplotype frequencies in our cohorts were found\nto be most pronounced for males. The first study published on\nthe association of SNPs in FOXO3A (Willcox et al. 2008) was\nconducted on an all male population and, moreover, five of six\nSNPs reported by Anselmi et al. (2009) were specific for males,\nwhereas only one was specific for females, indicating a gender\neffect. Moreover, adding further support to a male-specific\nassociation in the case\u00adcontrol study we observe no associations\nin females even though the sample size is larger for females than\nfor males (about 2.5-fold).\nIn addition to investigating differences in allele and genotype\nfrequencies, we also investigated the possible haplotypes in\nFOXO3A. Again, we find that the effect is almost restricted to\nmales (see Table 3 and Supporting information Table S4), and\nonly for the TAC and CAC haplotypes of window 1 (composed\nated at the genotype frequency level, so the observation that\nthe haplotypes including these two SNPs are found to be associ-\nated with longevity does not seem surprising.\nConsidering previous reporting (Flachsbart et al. 2009) of a\nmost significant effect in centenarians, we analyzed the cente-\nnarians separately. We were, however, not able to replicate\nthis finding; that is, we did not find additional SNPs to be asso-\nciated with longevity or an increased effect of the SNPs in the\ncentenarians (compared to the controls) as when comparing\nthe entire group of oldest old to the controls. The SNP found\nto be associated in both genders in the entire group of oldest\nthe entire group of oldest old was replicated in the centenari-\nans. The reason for the latter is probably the low sample size\nof male centenarians (N = 30) and hence lack of power to\ndetect associations.\nFinally, studies published so far on the association of\nFOXO3A SNPs with longevity have been case\u00adcontrol carried\nout by comparing the group of oldest old to a younger control\ngroup. To further investigate the association of FOXO3A SNPs\nwith extreme survival, we investigated the 15 SNPs using longi-\nFOXO3A SNPs are associated with human longevity, M.

Three SNPs were found\ngenotype from middle age to old age was observed in the case\u00ad\ncontrol study, which seems contradictory to the survival disad-\nvantage during old age. The latter might, however, be explained\nby antagonistic pleiotropy, i.e., the two SNPs might have a posi-\ntive effect on survival from middle age until old age, yet a nega-\ntive effect during old age. However, none of these three SNPs\nhold significance after correction for multiple testing (via Bonfer-\nroni); hence, it might simply be chance findings and, hence, we\ncannot conclude of an association based on the longitudinal\ndata.\nIn this study, we replicated some of the previous findings\nregarding an association of variation in the FOXO3A gene with\nhuman longevity using a case\u00adcontrol approach and, moreover,\nfound novel SNPs to be associated. In addition, we report of a\nlongitudinal analysis, which did, however, not show results hold-\ning for the correction of multiple testing. Hence, our findings\nadd further evidence to the role of FOXO3A as a longevity candi-\ndate gene from younger ages to old age, yet not during old age.\nExperimental procedures\nSubjects\nThe oldest old individuals of our study (N = 1089) were partici-\npants in The Danish 1905 Cohort Study, which includes all\nwere assessed for the first time in 1998, when they were\n92\u00ad93 years of age. Survivors were subsequently assessed every\nsecond year through 2005, and vital status followed until Janu-\nary 1st 2010 or until death, whichever came first, resulting in a\nmean follow-up time for the survivors of 11.4 years (range:\n11.2\u00ad11.6). Information on survival status was retrieved from\nthe Danish Central Population Register, which is continuously\nupdated (Pedersen et al. 2006). The younger control group\n(N = 736) of this study was randomly selected from the Study of\nMiddle-Aged Danish Twins (Skytthe et al. 2002), which was ini-\nCentral Person Registry. The participants have been followed\nlongitudinally through different registers (including Statistics\nDenmark). The control group in the study presented here\nincludes only one twin from each twin pair. Of the 736 individu-\nals, 35 had died since the beginning of the survey in 1998, and\nonly approximately 9% of the 736 individuals are expected to\nturn 93 years of age (this estimate is based on period life table\ndata for the Danish population (http://www.mortality.org)). One\npotential confounder in association studies is population stratifi-\ncation, however, because of minimal immigration into both\nthese cohorts, the cohorts must be considered to be genetically\nhomogenous and population stratification to be minimal.\nIn the case\u00adcontrol part of the study presented here, we inves-\ntigate the association of FOXO3A SNPs in the controls when\ncompared to the entire group of oldest old (N = 1089), as well\nas of those individuals from the 1905 cohort who became cente-\nnarians (N = 143). The reason for doing so is that the association\nof FOXO3A SNPs with longevity has previously been reported to\nbe most pronounced for centenarians (Flachsbart et al. 2009).\nBoth surveys included multidimensional face-to-face inter-\nviews, assessment of functional and cognitive abilities and DNA\nsampling. Permission to collect blood samples and usage of reg-\nister-based information was granted by The Danish National\nCommittee on Biomedical Research Ethics.\nSelection of chromosome region and tagging SNPs\nThe genomic region investigated in this study is position\nsponds to FOXO3A and 5000 base pair (bp) upstream and\n1000 bp down stream (NCBI assemble 36). Data about variation\nin this gene region were obtained through the HapMap consor-\ntium database (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html.en)\nfor the CEPH (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and\nwestern Europe (CEPH) (CEU)) cohort, using the HapMap Data\ncriteria. Genotype SNP data were analyzed using the HaploView\nsoftware (http://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview,\nthe known common genetic variation in FOXO3A (`pair wise\ntagging only', R2 = 0.8, LOD = 3 and a minimum distance\nbetween SNPs = 60 bp criteria were used). All tagging and can-\ndidate SNPs included in this study have a minor allele frequency\n(MAF) of at least 5%.\nGenotyping\nDNA was isolated from blood spot samples using the QIAamp\nDNA Mini and Micro Kits (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany). Geno-\ntyping of the 15 FOXO3A SNPs was performed using the Illumina\nGoldenGate platform (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and data\ncleanup was performed according to Illumina Inc's recommenda-\ntions (http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/\ntechnote_infinium_genotyping_data_analysis.pdf). Finally, 24\nand 48 DNA samples were included twice in the GoldenGate\nassay to investigate the intra-plate and the inter-plate reproduc-\nibility. Data showed an intra-plate reproducibility of 99.4% (using\nsamples).\nStatistics\nThe Plink statistical program (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/\npurcell/plink, (Purcell et al. 2007)) was used for investigating\nFOXO3A SNPs are associated with human longevity, M.

P-val-\nues were obtained for allelic case\u00adcontrol comparison (PCCA),\nfor genotypic case\u00adcontrol comparison (PCCG), and for haplo-\ntypic case\u00adcontrol comparison (PCCH). Analysis of differences in\ngenotype frequencies was carried out by assuming firstly a\ngenotype (assumption free) model and secondly recessive and\ndominant models. Haplotypes were investigated using the `Slid-\ning window' application in Plink, by setting the window at three\nSNPs sliding along the 15 SNPs in the order defined by their posi-\ntions on chromosome 6.\nThe longitudinal survival data analysis on the oldest old was\nconducted by using the STATA 10.0 statistical program (Stata\nCorporation, College Station, TX, USA) for estimating the\nmortality risk using the Cox proportional hazard model.\nA nominal significance level was set at P < 0.05, and the per-\nmutation application in Plink was used for correcting for multi-\nple testing of the allele, genotype, and haplotype data (applying\nmax(T) permutation mode set at 1000 permutations), while for\nthe Cox regression analysis, a Bonferroni correction level at\n"
