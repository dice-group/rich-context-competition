Life history theory (LHT) is the study of life cycles and life history\ntraits in an ecological context (Chisholm, 1999), integrating evolutionary, ecological, and\nsocio-developmental perspectives in the study of sex differences in developmental patterns\n(Geary, 2002). Our study indicates the correspondence of psychological indicators of\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nwomen's life history attributes with hypothetical and actual behaviors in mating\nrelationships.\nThe human pair bond is unusual for a mammalian species; the majority of\nmammalian males pursue solely short-term liaisons without paternal investment because it\nis advantageous for them to invest exclusively in mating effort (Clutton-Brock, 1989; Daly\nand Wilson, 1978; Trivers, 1972). Despite the large number of potential alternative mates,\nboth men and women generally allocate a considerable amount of reproductive effort to\nparenting. This may occur because human infants and children require considerably more\ncare than those of our primate relatives (Fisher, 1992); children who grow up without a\nfather suffer higher mortality rates, especially in pre-industrial societies (Geary, 1998; Hill\nand Hurtado, 1994). It may be in women's interests to pursue primarily long-term\nrelationships that allow such investments.\nNumerous studies show that women are attracted to men who are socially respected,\nfinancially stable, older, wealthy, ambitious, industrious, dependable, emotionally stable,\nWiederman and Allgeier, 1992), attributes that suggest the potential for long-term\ninvestment in a relationship and offspring (Buss, 1994). Although women may prefer these\ntraits in potential fathers, not all men possess these attributes. Men reliably show a clear\ndesire for sexual variety (Buss, 1994; Schmitt et al., 2003), and seek more mates for sexual\nrelations than women (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).\nMale reproductive success benefits from short-term sexual relationships because\neven a brief sexual tryst may increase the number of a man's descendents. The male bias of\nmating effort over paternal investment leads males to be less selective about particular\nfeatures of females than vice versa. In humans, women make greater pre- and post-natal\ncontributions of resources (Fisher, 1992); the mother provides the cytoplasm, pregnancy,\nbreast milk, and the majority of care for small children. Women became increasingly more\nburdened by child care as humans' span of development elongated. Across species, male\nreproductive success varies more than that of females (e.g., Hall and DeVore, 1965; Jacobs,\nmultiple females; however females are limited to having one pregnancy at a time. Thus,\nwomen are more selective about partners for sexual relationships than men in response to\ntheir significantly lower reproductive ceiling (Trivers, 1972).\nHowever, despite the dramatic sex differences in the costs and benefits of short-\nterm mating, women still seek short-term mates. Why should a woman mate with a man\nwho is unlikely to help her in bearing and raising their offspring? Fisher (1930) proposed\nthat women's offspring would benefit from men who could provide high-quality genes\npromoting health, attractiveness to the opposite sex, and ultimately reproductive success.\nThe related \"sexy son hypothesis\" predicts that women have evolved tendencies to prefer\nmen with phenotypic indicators of high genetic quality to those with cues of high potential\npaternal investment when obtaining reliable paternal investment is unlikely (e.g.,\nWomen may also have short-term sexual relations with men in exchange for\nresource provisioning, especially when they are caring for children and in need of\ninvestment (Lancaster, 1989; Wyatt, Forge, and Guthrie, 1998). In the Ache and Bar\u00ed\nsocieties of South America, women have sex with men who are not their social partners,\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nespecially after they become pregnant. This may serve to confuse paternity, as these men\nbecome secondary fathers who are socially obligated to protect and invest in the woman's\nchildren. As a result, their contributions raise the children's survival rate (Beckerman et al.,\nHowever, the majority of women do tend to prefer males who have observable\ncharacteristics signaling high levels of genetic fitness for short-term relationships (Kruger,\nFisher, and Jobling, 2003; Kruger, 2006). Although long-term partners would also\ncontribute genetic fitness to offspring, these attributes are not nearly as important to women\nwhen they are choosing long-term mates (Kruger, et al., 2003; Kruger, 2006). Women\nexpress higher expectations for a partner's attractiveness when considering a one-night\nstand than for a steady dating relationship (Kenrick, Groth, Trost, and Sadalla, 1993). In a\nstudy of female law students, not one would consider an attractive man with low socio-\neconomic status for marriage, although some would agree to have sex with him. They\nalways preferred marriage to sex with a high socio-economic status man, whether he was\nattractive or not (Townsend and Roberts, 1993).\nPatricia Draper and her colleagues argue that men have evolved to specialize in\neither short-term \"cad\" or long-term \"dad\" mating strategies (Belsky, Steinberg, and\nresemble a \"sexy son\" strategy, attracting women by showing that they are highly\ncompetitive, dominant, brave, aggressive, high in risk-taking, and rebellious, and\npresumably, they will produce sons with similar characteristics. Dads attract women\nbecause they are compassionate, kind, romantic, and industrious, demonstrating the ability\nand willingness to invest in the relationship and parentally invest in potential children.\nCross-culturally, cads and dads show distinct clusters of personality traits reflecting\nattributes women respectively value in men for short-term and long-term relationships (see\nBelsky et al. (1991) propose that cads and dads follow developmental trajectories\ntriggered by the absence or presence of a father, respectively. They have amassed cross-\ncultural evidence that men who experienced father absence favor a sexually promiscuous\nmating strategy, are misogynistic and reluctant to engage in parental investment, and are\nviolent, aggressive, rebellious, high in risk-taking, and at high risk of incarceration. Men\nwho grew up in father-present households are more likely to delay sexual experience, have\npositive attitudes towards and develop stable pair-bonds with women, have good relations\nwith male peers, and accept authority (Draper and Harpending 1982, 1988; Draper and\nBowlby (1969) believed that one's early social experiences make a substantial\nimpact on one's personality and behavior as an adult. Children who feel loved and\nwelcomed by their parents experience \"secure attachment;\" and those who feel unloved and\nunwelcomed experience one of the forms of \"insecure attachment.\" He formed his theories,\nin part, from observations that early and impulsive displays of sexual and aggressive\nbehavior were most prevalent in individuals who had experienced disturbed family\nrelations (Chisholm, 1999). More recently, Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper (1991) have\nproposed that the attachment process is an evolved psychological mechanism to evaluate\nlife conditions and choose an appropriate reproductive strategy in one's environment. Thus,\ninsecure attachment is a response to environmental cues that long-term monogamous\nrelationships are not a viable strategy in the social world in which the child is growing up.\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nIn a stressful or hazardous environment, one's early childhood is more likely to be\ncharacterized by psychological stress, due to the lessened abilities or attention of parents,\nleading to insecure attachment styles and short-term mating strategies.\nThis theory explains empirical findings that women who grow up in father-absent\nhouseholds, a major risk factor for insecure attachment, show earlier sexual activity, as well\nas a lack of interest or ability to form and/or maintain, long-term monogamous\nrelationships (Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper 1991, Chisholm, 1999). Women who have a\nwarm relationship with their fathers as children and have a father who is highly invested in\nthe family reach menarche later than those with an emotionally distant or absent father\n(Ellis, McFadyen-Ketchum, Dodge, Pettit, and Bates, 1999). A chronically risky and\nuncertain environment, as well as family conflict, is associated with earlier menarche,\nearlier ages of reproduction, and higher reproductive rates (Chisholm, 1999; Kim, Smith,\nand Palermiti, 1997). Note that earlier menarche is also associated with better nutrition\nSome portion of life history strategy may be heritable because twin studies\nindicated that genes typically account for 50% of the variance in most personality traits\n(e.g., Jang, McCrae, Angleitner, Riemann, and Livesley, 1998). Researchers have identified\na complex interaction between genetic variation and environmental conditions and\nconclude that behavioral tendencies are contingent on both components (Hill, Ross, and\nLow, 1997). The Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper (1991) model has been challenged with the\nargument that heritable socio-sexuality accounts for the relationship between father absence\nand early sexual activity in daughters. Some have suggested that one mechanism is\nheritable variation in the X-linked androgen receptor gene (AR), which determines\nsensitivity to testosterone. Gottlieb, Beitel, Lumbroso, Pinsky and Trifiro, (1999) reported\nnearly 400 AR gene mutations. One study tested whether the relationship between parental\nseparation and reproductive pattern was mediated through variation in the AR gene.\nAlthough relationship patterns were partially due to heritability, this did not completely\naccount for the effects of father absence (Comings, Muhleman, Johnson, and MacMurray,\n2002). Also, the connection between parental separation and reproductive development was\nfound independently of socioeconomic status and mothers' reproductive behavior (Quinlan,\nSecurely attached adults are more likely to describe their major adult romantic\nrelationships as happy, friendly, and trusting, and to have fewer and longer lasting\nrelationships than those who are insecurely attached (Hazan and Shaver, 1987). Unmarried\nuniversity students who were insecurely attached had significantly more negative\nexpectations of their parenting abilities and about children (Rholes et al. 1997). These\npredictions may be accurate, as attachment style does indeed appear to affect parenting\neffectiveness. For example, women who report a divorce, death, or long-term separation in\ntheir families are more likely to be teenage mothers, and to talk, look, and touch their\nbabies significantly less than other mothers (Hall, Pawlby, and Wolkind 1979), thus setting\nthe stage for insecure attachment in their own offspring.\nAdditional psychological constructs may be related to life history. Sociosexuality is\ndefined as an individual's perception of the requirements in terms of time, attachment, and\ncommitment for having a sexual relationship (Gangestad and Simpson, 1990). Females\nwith restrictive sociosexuality have higher requirements than unrestricted females, and are\nmore likely to enhance their reproductive success by obtaining paternal investment.\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nUnrestrictive females are more likely to follow the \"sexy son\" strategy, and their offspring\nmay benefit through the quality of their mate's genes. Gangestad and Simpson (1992)\ndemonstrated that restrictive females value personal and parenting qualities more so than\nattractiveness and social visibility, whereas the reverse pattern was true for unrestricted\nfemales.\nSelf-monitoring may also be related to mating strategies (Snyder and Gangestad,\n1986). High self-monitors regulate their self-presentation in the hope of radiating the\ndesired social appearance, low self-monitors express inner states at the expense of\npresentation. Individuals with high self-monitoring tend to not establish committed\nrelationships and maintain an unrestrictive sexual orientation (Snyder and Simpson, 1984;\nSnyder, Simpson, and Gangestad, 1986). Those with low self-monitoring tend to establish\ncommitted relationships and maintain a restrictive sexual orientation.\nLife history theory predicts that individuals who develop in relatively more\nuncertain environments will develop riskier, short-term, behavioral strategies than\nIn these environments, the most pressing adaptive problem faced by individuals may be\navoiding death. When mortality rates are low and predictable, there are fewer urgent\nadaptive problems and a less risky, long-term strategy is optimal. Psychological measures\nof time perspective may tap into these features of life history. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999)\nhave constructed scales to measure five factors of an individual's time perspective, which\nthey consider a pervasive, powerful, and largely unrecognized influence on human\nbehavior. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) found that sensation seeking was correlated with\npresent-hedonic orientation (hedonism and risk taking) and inversely related to future\norientation (striving for future goals and rewards, rather than immediate gratification).\nConsideration for future consequences mirrored future orientation, and was inversely\nrelated to present-hedonistic orientation.\nWe have recently developed an additional psychological instrument that may be\nuseful in examining women's life history strategies (Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling, 2003),\nbased on the correspondence between the personality traits of proper and dark (or Byronic\nor Romantic) heroes of late 18th and early 19th century British Romantic literature and the\nattributes of dad and cad mating strategies. Proper heroes exemplify long-term mating\nstrategies with reliable paternal investment in offspring; these men are typically law-\nabiding, compassionate, kind, and monogamous. Dark heroes maximize their reproductive\nsuccess by having many short-term relationships without parental investment; these\ncharacters are socially dominant, rebellious, frequently criminals (although often justified\nby a tyrannical government), and often promiscuous. We found that women's tendencies to\nchoose dark hero cads over proper hero dads for a hypothetical relationship increased as the\nrelationship length decreased, following the type of investment (parental vs. genetic)\nvalued in each type of relationship (Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling, 2003).\nWe currently predict that women with insecure attachment styles, suggesting an\nunreliable developmental environment and the consequential tendency towards short-term\nmating strategies, will have a stronger tendency to form relationships with cads. They may\nfollow a strategy designed to maximize their immediate reproductive success by obtaining\nhigh quality genes for offspring, rather than deferring their sexual involvement until they\nare relatively certain of extended paternal investment in a long-term relationship.\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nMoreover, we predict that the likelihood of engaging in brief sexual relationships\nwith dads and cads will be elevated for women with unrestricted sociosexuality, and that\nthese women will be more likely to consider short-term and long-term relationships with\ncads. Simpson and Gangestad (1991) found that women with a reported history of\nrelatively unrestricted sexual relations were more prone to care about a partner's sexual\nappeal and attractiveness, and less about personality in terms of kindness, understanding,\nbeliefs and faithfulness. Women who score higher in self-monitoring are also expected to\nfollow this pattern.\nWe further predict that women whose time perspectives encourage short-term\nmating strategies, those high in present hedonism, will be more likely to predict having\nrelationships with cads. Those high in future orientation will exhibit the reverse pattern.\nWomen who reached menarche earlier, one indicator of environmental uncertainty\naccompanied by less reliable social and familial support, should also have a greater\ntendency to choose cads for relationships. Finally, we predict that women who score higher\non indicators reflecting short-term life-history strategies will exhibit behaviors reflecting\nthese strategies: they will on average report having more short-term relationships, more\npartners in the last year, more one time partners, and a greater propensity to cheat on their\nprimary partners than those women whose scores suggest longer-term strategies.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthnically diverse (61% indicated some non-Western European ancestry) female\nuniversity participated to fulfill a course requirement. Participants completed surveys at\ntheir convenience over the Internet, which included the Experiences in Close Relationships\n(ECR) inventory (Brennan, Clark, and Shaver, 1998) to assess attachment style, the Future\nOrientation and Present-Hedonistic scales from the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory\n(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), items measuring socio-sexuality (Simpson and Gangestad,\n1991), self-monitoring (Snyder and Gangestad, 1986), and a hypothetical version of an\nexperiment asking how likely participants would be to have sex with an attractive stranger\n(Clark and Hatfield, 1989). Participants indicated the age at which they reached menarche\nand the number of times they have cheated on their partners. Participants read descriptive\nWalter Scott, and a prototypical dark hero cad, George Staunton from The Heart of\nMidlothian (1818) also by Walter Scott. Vocabulary keys defining several archaic or arcane\nwords or phrases were included for each passage.\nParticipants rated how likely they would be to have long-term committed, short-\nterm, and brief sexual relationships with each character. We correlated scores on life\nhistory indicators with hypothetical relationship choices and behaviors in actual\nrelationships. We assigned participants to one of Bartholomew and Horowitz's (1991)\nattachment style categories with computations from the Experiences in Close Relationships\n(ECR) scale (See Brennan, Clark, and Shaver, 1998) and conducted an Analysis of\nVariance (ANOVA) on the likelihood of relationships with the cad. These attachment style\ncategories are based on the positivity or negativity of scores from two dimensions:\nevaluation of the self and evaluation of others as accepting and responsive. The categories\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nare secure (positive self, positive others), preoccupied (negative self, negative others),\ndismissing (positive self, negative others), and fearful (negative self, negative others).\nResults\nWomen who scored higher on ECR-avoidance were most likely to say they would\nhave short-term and long-term committed relationships with the cad (See Table 1). Women\nwho scored higher on ECR-anxiety were most likely to say they would have a: brief sexual\naffair with the dad, brief sexual affair with the cad, short-term relationship with a cad, and a\nlong-term committed relationship with a cad. Women who differed in attachment styles\nsignificantly differed in their estimated likelihood of having a short-term relationship with a\nTable 1.

Anxiety\nscores (indicating insecure attachment) were positively associated with the number of\npartners in the past 12 months, as well as participants' number of one-time partners. Those\nwho scored higher in sociosexuality had more long-term partners, more partners in the past\n12 months, more one-time partners, and cheated on their partners more often than those\nwho scored lower. Higher scores on self-monitoring were associated with having more\nlong-term and short-term partners. Higher degrees of present hedonism were associated\nwith having more long-term and short-term partners, more partners in the past 12 months,\nmore one-time partners, and greater incidence of cheating behaviors. Future time\nperspective was not associated with any of the behavioral measures.\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate the value of a life history framework for understanding\nwomen's mating choices. Women with insecure attachment styles, especially those with\nnegative evaluations of both themselves and others (fearful attachment), were more likely\nto consider cads for short-term and long-term relationships than women with a secure\nattachment style. This lends support to the causal framework proposed by Belsky,\nSteinberg, and Draper (1991), where psychological mechanisms following from\nunpredictability in one's early social environment promote tendencies towards short-term\nmating strategies later in life.\nWomen with relatively unrestricted sociosexuality were more likely than those with\nrestricted sociosexuality to predict sexual affairs with dads and cads, with the tendency\nbeing generally stronger for cads. Relatively unrestricted women were also more likely to\nconsider both short-term and long-term relationships with cads, across multiple indicators\nof sociosexuality. The frequency with which the women had cheated on their partners was\nalso significantly correlated with the likelihood of sex with the dad and of all types of\nrelationships with the cad. None of these measures were significantly related to the\nlikelihood of a long-term committed relationship with the dad. Also, as predicted by our\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nevolutionary framework, those who scored high on self-monitoring were more likely to\npredict they would have sexual affairs and short-term relationships with the cad.\nThe relationship between time perspective and mating preference was not as\ncomprehensive as expected, but all significant relationships were in the predicted direction.\nPresent hedonistic orientation was positively related to the likelihood of brief sexual affairs\nwith both dads and cads. There was an inverse relationship between future orientation and\nthe likelihood of having a brief sexual affair with the cad, but this did not reach\nsignificance.\nPsychological indicators of life history strategies were also correlated with rates of\nactual behaviors, such as: the number of short-term and long-term relationships participants\nhave experienced, the number of partners they have had in the past 12 months, the number\nof one-time partners, and even the frequency of cheating behavior. Although the strength of\nthe findings with the life history indicators may appear small, they are near the mean effect\nsize of social psychological research. Cohen (1988) indicated that a correlation of .30 was a\nmoderate effect in psychological research; Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota (2003) found\nthat the mean effect size for published social psychological research translated into a\ncorrelation of r = .21. It is likely that stronger effects would be found with a sample more\nrepresentative of the general population. The socio-economic background and age range of\nundergraduate participants attending a highly selective university is probably constricted.\nIt is notable that women with more unrestricted sociosexuality and shorter time\nhorizons were more likely to predict short-term sexual relations with both the cad and the\ndad. This suggests that the benefits of resource provisioning may complement the benefits\nof high quality genes in brief sexual relationships, as both dads and cads may provide\nmaterial support for the duration of the relationship. Also, the preferences that women\nexpress as college students do not necessarily correspond with those possessed by the\nindividual they will chose as a partner for a long-term relationship (See Todd, Penke,\nFasolo, and Lenton, 2007). In fact, women attending college may explore their options and\ntake opportunities to have relationships with men who they would not actually consider for\nmarriage.\nOne may be puzzled by the results concerning longer term relationships with cads.\nIf cads are valuable for their genetic investment, why would women with riskier life history\nstrategies seek them for long-term relationships? The psychological mechanism promoting\nan adaptive strategy could vary, as long as it reliably leads to the adaptive behaviors.\nWomen may fully intend to have long-term committed relationships with cads, whether or\nnot this actually happens. Modern day mass-market romance novels feature cad like\ncharacters who are ultimately tamed into long-term relationships by the female protagonist\n(Barash and Barash, 2005; Salmon and Symons, 2003). It is not surprising that this \"best of\nboth worlds\" outcome makes for such popular reading.\nWomen may also use short-term sexual relationships to assess and demonstrate\ntheir competitiveness in the mating marketplace (Townsend, 1999). Although ancestral\nwomen did not benefit as much as men did from a high quantity of partners, they may\ncompete with each other for high quality partners. This competition may be especially\nimportant in a nominally monogamous society, from which the respondent sample derives.\nOur experiment elucidates the usefulness of a life history approach for\nunderstanding women's relationship choices. This integrative framework holds the promise\nof advancing developmental and social psychology, as well as uniting psychology with\nWomen's life history and mating preferences\nother fields and levels of analysis. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the dad and cad\nexperimental paradigm for illustrating women's mating strategies.\nReferences\nArdener, E.W., Ardener, S.G., and Warmington, W.A. (1960).
