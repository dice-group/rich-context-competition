Cunningham, Charles Denk, and\nMichael Sinclair\nAllowing consumers greater choice\nof health plans is seen by many as the\nkey to both higher quality and lower\ncosts. A basic assumption behind this view is\nthat consumers can and do make informed\nchoices about the types of health plans they\nenroll in. In the past, informed choice required\nknowledge of the specific services covered by\nthe plan as well as copayments and deduct-\nibles. Today, however, consumers must also\nunderstand health plans as care delivery sys-\ntems, including rules for selecting providers\nfrom a specific network or going outside of\nthe network, the role of primary care provid-\ners, and procedures for obtaining referrals for\nspecialty care.\nPrevious research has shown that many\nconsumers lack a basic understanding of key\nmanaged care concepts and features, although\nit is not clear whether this lack of knowledge\nalso extends to their own health plan.1 Failure\nto understand the delivery-system aspects of\ntheir own plan could result in confusion and\nfrustration, which may ultimately affect satis-\nfaction and quality of care.\nIn this paper we use unique data from the\nto compare consumers' responses to ques-\ntions about their health plan attributes with\ninformation obtained from the actual plans in\nwhich they are enrolled. We examine how ac-\ncurately consumers report on basic plan fea-\ntures related to choice of providers and access\nto specialists, including (1) whether they\nmust choose from a list or network of provid-\ners; (2) whether the plan covers any of the\ncosts for going outside of the network; (3)\nwhether they are required to sign up with a\nprimary care provider; and (4) whether they\nare required to get a referral or plan approval\nfor specialty care.\nData And Methods\nn Data.

Families were de-\nfined to include all persons eligible for cover-\nage under a typical private health insurance\npolicy. Separate interviews were conducted\nfor each family in the household.\nFor each family interview, an individual\nconsidered to be knowledgeable about the\nhealth, health insurance coverage, and health\ncare use of family members was selected as\nthe \"family respondent\" (usually a parent for\nfamilies with children). In addition, respon-\ndents were asked about the specific attributes\nof the private insurance plans they and other\nfamily members were enrolled in, namely, the\nplan's requirements for selecting providers\nfrom a network, rules for going outside of the\nnetwork, and \"gatekeeping\" requirements\nRespondents also were asked to identify\nthe health plans that family members were\nenrolled in, which were then contacted by\ntelephone in a \"follow-back\" survey. Plans\nwere asked to report on the same attributes\nthat were asked of household respondents, as\nwell as other plan features not asked about in\nthe household survey. Respondents to the\nfollow-back survey generally included mar-\nketing directors or other persons knowledge-\nable about plans' characteristics.4\nn Methods. The unit of analysis in this\nstudy is the family health plan. For each plan\nreported on by the family respondent (up to\nthree per family), responses to the questions\non plan attributes were linked to plans' re-\nsponses to these same questions in the follow-\nback survey. By linking responses in this man-\nner, we estimate the percentage of health\nplans for which there was agreement between\nthe family and health plan respondents. Plans\nthat had missing values on the attributes for\neither the family or plan respondent were ex-\ncluded (less than 3 percent of plans for each\nattribute). Thus, lack of agreement between\nfamily and health plan reports reflects inaccu-\nrate reporting on the part of the family re-\nspondent, not failure to answer the question.\nhealth plans that included both family and\nHealth Plan Attributes Asked In The Household And Follow-Back Surveys, Community\nNetwork attributes\nNetwork Is there a book, directory, or list of\ndoctors associated with the plan?\nIs there a book, directory, or list of\ndoctors associated with this product?\nOut-of-network coverage If you do not have a referral, will your\nplan pay for any of the costs of visits\nto doctors who are not associated\nwith the plan?\nIf enrollees do not have a referral\nand go to out-of-network doctors,\ndoes the plan cover any of the\ncosts for these visits?\nGatekeeping attributes\nPCP requirement Does your plan require you to sign up\nwith a certain primary care doctor,\ngroup of doctors, or clinic, which you\nmust go to for all of your routine care?\nDoes this product require members\nto have a primary care doctor, group\nof doctors, or clinic for all routine care?\nSpecialty care referral To see a specialist under your plan,\ndo you need to get a referral, that is,\napproval or permission, from your\ndoctor or health plan?\nIf enrollees do not have a referral\nand go to in-network specialists,\ndoes the plan cover any of the\ncosts for these visits?\nSOURCE: 1996\u00ad97 Community Tracking Study household survey and follow-back survey of health plans.\nNOTE: PCP is primary care provider.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 2\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

About 7 percent of family re-\nspondents (751) reported on more than one\nhealth plan (mostly two).6 The sample in-\ncludes only private health insurance plans.\nPublic coverage--including Medicare,\nMedicaid, and Medigap plans--was not in-\ncluded. Almost all respondents were between\nthe ages of eighteen and sixty-four. Only\nabout 100 family respondents--about 1 per-\ncent of the total--were age sixty-five or older.\nAttributes were divided into network-\nrelatedattributes andgatekeeperattributes (see\nExhibit 1). The former include whether plan en-\nrolleeswererequiredto selectfrom anetworkor\nlist of providers, and whether the plan covered\nany of the costs for going outside the network.\nThe latter include whether enrollees were re-\nquired to select a primary care provider, as well\nas whether members needed a referral or ap-\nproval from the plan to see a specialist.\nResults\nn Frequency of plan attributes. Estimates\nof the percentage of plans that have restric-\ntions on provider choice and access differ de-\npending on whether the information was re-\nported by the family respondent or the plan\nrespondent. Estimates of the percentage of\nplans that have a network of providers are\nlower based on family reports than they are\nbased on plan reports (Exhibit 2), although\nestimates of the percentage of plans that have\nno out-of-network coverage are roughly simi-\nlar. On the other hand, estimates of the per-\ncentage of plans that require referral for spe-\ncialty care based on family respondent reports\nare more than twice as high as those based on\nhealth plan reports, which suggests a very high\ndegree of overreporting by family respondents.\nThe percentage of plans that require patients\nto sign up with a primary care provider was\nalso higher based on family reports.7\nn Agreement between family and plan\nrespondents. Overall, family respondents\nwere most accurate in reporting on whether\nthe plan had a network of providers and least\naccurate about whether referrals were re-\nquired to see specialists (Exhibit 3). In gen-\neral, agreement rates tended to be much\nhigher when plans had restrictions on\nprovider choice and access than when they\ndid not have them. This is most apparent in\nthe case of referral requirements for specialty\ncare, where family and health plan respon-\nPercentage Of Family Health Plans With Specific Attributes, As Reported By Both\nNetwork\nPercent with network\nPercent with no network\nOut-of-network coverage\nPercent with no out-of-network coverage\nPercent with out-of-network coverage\nPCP sign-up\nPercent that require sign-up with PCP\nPercent that do not require PCP sign-up\nSpecialty care referral\nPercent that require approval\nPercent that do not require approval\nSOURCE: 1996\u00ad97 Community Tracking Study household survey and follow-back survey of health plans.\nNOTE: PCP is primary care provider.\na Difference with estimate based on family respondent is statistically significant at the .05 level.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, the agreement\nrate was only 47 percent when the plandid not\nrequire specialty referral, which indicates that\noverreporting the need for specialty referral is\na much bigger problem than underreporting.\nThe high degree of overreporting the need\nfor specialty care approval may be due in part\nto differences in the questions asked of family\nand health plan respondents. Because family\nrespondents were not asked whether the plan\npays for any of the costs for self-referrals to\nspecialists (as health plan respondents were\nasked), they may have answered the question\nin terms of what the plan required for full\ncoverage (see Exhibit 1). This is most likely to\noccur for those enrolled in open-access plans,\nsuch as point-of-service (POS) plans, in\nwhich self-referrals for specialty care are usu-\nally allowed at reduced coverage. About one-\nfourth of the plans in which the need for spe-\ncialty referral was overreported were POS or\nopen-access health maintenance organization\n(HMO) plans. Thus, even if we assume that\nmost of the misreporting for this subset of\nplans was due to differences in the questions\nrather than lack of knowledge, overall agree-\nment rates for this attribute would still be\nlower than for the other attributes.8\nAgreement was also higher when the plan\nhad a network and when a primary care\nprovider was required. The one exception was\nthat family respondents tended to be more\naccurate about reporting that the plan had\ncoverage for out-of-network services (75 per-\ncent) than when there was no coverage for\nthese services (61 percent).\nn Type of health plan versus plan attrib-\nutes.

The results show that\nabout three-fourths of family respondents ac-\ncurately reported whether their plan was an\nHMO, which is a higher rate of agreement\nthan for three of the four attributes (the net-\nwork attribute being the exception). Unlike\nthe plan attributes, overreporting HMO plan\ntype did not appear to be more of a problem\nthan underreporting it.\nIt is unknown whether consumers are any\nmore accurate in reporting other plan types,\nsuch as fee-for-service (FFS) plans, preferred\nprovider organizations (PPOs), or POS plans.\nHowever, it is likely that consumers' recogni-\ntion of these terms is lower than for HMOs,\nespecially considering the extensive media at-\ntention HMOs have received.9\nn Overall accuracy of reporting. Al-\nthough the accuracy of reporting on some in-\ndividual attributes was fairly high, fewer than\none-third of respondents (30.3 percent) cor-\nrectly reported all four attributes.10 In addi-\ntion, just over half of respondents (56 per-\ncent) accurately reported both network\nattributes, while just under half (48.8 per-\ncent) accurately reported both gatekeeper at-\ntributes. However, among the most restrictive\nplans, agreement between the family respon-\ndent and plan respondent on all four restric-\ntions was somewhat higher (50 percent).\nn Factors affecting family respon-\ndents' accuracy. There were no differences\nin the accuracy of reporting all four attributes\nby amount of experience with HMOs, but\nthere were some differences depending on\nlevel of plan choice, health status, and level of\neducation. However, the accuracy of report-\ning all four attributes did not exceed 36 per-\ncent for any characteristic we examined.11\nExperience with HMOs. One might expect\nthat greater experience with managed care\nplans--especially HMOs--would lead to\nmore accurate reporting of these attributes.\nAlthough agreement rates on all four attrib-\nutes are slightly higher for respondents with\nmore than one year's experience with HMOs,\nthese small differences were not statistically\nsignificant (Exhibit 4). Differences in agree-\nment rates for network and gatekeeping attrib-\nutes by level of experience with HMOs were\nalso small and not statistically significant.\nChoice of healthplans. Respondents who have\na choice of employer plans may be more accu-\nrate in reporting plan attributes, either be-\ncause employers provide more information\nabout plans or because employees make more\nof an effort to understand plan differences\nwhen they have a choice. We found that the\naccuracy of reporting all four attributes was\nhighest among respondents who had a choice\nof HMO and non-HMO plans (36 percent)\nand lowest among those offered only a single\nHMO plan (25 percent). These differences ap-\npear to be attributable mostly to the accuracy\nof reporting gatekeeping attributes.\nOne exception to the general trend is that\nrespondents offered only a single non-HMO\nplan had the second-highest overall rate of\nagreement (30.4 percent) and had agreement\nrates on network attributes that were similar\nto those offered a choice of HMO and non-\nHMO plans (about 53 percent). It is possible\nthat having a single plan offering with few\nrestrictions is often easier to comprehend\nthan when plans or plan offerings are more\ncomplicated, or it may be due to other respon-\ndent characteristics that are also associated\nwith relatively higher agreement.\nHealth status. One might also expect greater\naccuracy in reporting among respondents\nwith significant health needs, both because\nplan restrictions may be ofgreater importance\nto them and because they are likely to have\nmore direct experiences in knowing how\ntheir plan works. Surprisingly, respondents\nwho reported their health as poor were\nslightly less likely to accurately report all four\nattributes than were persons who reported\ntheir health as excellent, good, or fair, al-\nthough these small differences were not sta-\ntistically significant. The less accurate report-\ning may reflect having fewer choices or other\ncharacteristics associated with lower accuracy\nin reporting (such as socioeconomic status).\nEducation.

These differences ap-\npear to be a combination of accuracy of re-\nporting both network and gatekeeper attrib-\nutes. However, only about one-third of\nrespondents with a college degree accurately\nreported all four attributes, which is only\nslightly higher than for respondents who had\nonly completed high school.\nDiscussion\nEnabling consumers to have a greater role in\nchoosing their health plan is an explicit or\nimplicit goal of many policy proposals, in-\ncluding those that would provide tax subsi-\ndies to purchase insurance in the nongroup\nmarket, create or expand purchasing coopera-\ntives, allow individuals to buy in to the Fed-\neral Employees Health Benefits Program\n(FEHBP), and mandate employers to offer a\nchoice of plans.

Although the\naccuracy in reporting some individual attrib-\nutes was relatively high, only about one-third\ncorrectly identified all four attributes related\nto the use of networks and gatekeepers.\nn Overreporting of restrictions. In addi-\ntion, overreporting of plan restrictions on ac-\ncess and physician choice appears to be more\nof a problem than underreporting is. That is,\nconsumers enrolled in plans that restrict en-\nrollees' access and choice generally appear to\nhave greater awareness of these restrictions\n(with the exception of not being able to go out\nof network), while consumers who are not\nrestricted often believe that they are.\nThis overreporting may be the result of\nconsumers' being influenced by media reports\non managed care practices--which they in-\ncorrectly assume also apply to their own\nhealth plan--or negative experiences with\ntheir own health care that they incorrectly at-\ntribute to plan restrictions.\nn Implications for satisfaction and ac-\ncess. A lack of understanding of how one's\nhealth plan works also has implications for\nconsumer satisfaction and access to care.\nConsumers may experience greater barriers to\ncare if they are unaware of plan restrictions\nregarding provider choice and access, or they\nmay delay getting care because they mistak-\nenly believe that their plan requires them to\nget authorization or approval to visit a certain\ndoctor or receive certain services. The CTS\ndata show that consumers who mistakenly\nbelieved that they needed a referral for spe-\ncialty care were somewhat more likely to re-\nport delays in getting care than were consum-\ners who accurately reported that plan\napproval was not required (25 percent versus\n22 percent overall). On the other hand, con-\nsumers who were unaware that their plan re-\nquired referrals for specialty care were less\nlikely to report delays in getting care than\nwere consumers who accurately reported that\nplan approval was required (19 percent versus\n25 percent). As other findings from the CTS\nhousehold and follow-back surveys have\nshown, these findings suggest that people's\nperceptions of plan restrictions may be more\nimportant in influencing their assessments of\ncare than the actual plan attributes are.12\nn Need for more consumer informa-\ntion. The results suggest the need for more\nconsumer information and education about\nhow health plans work, particularly the\n\"managed care\" features that are more typical\nof health plans today. A considerable body of\nevidence indicates that early efforts to edu-\ncate consumers have not been very effective\nand that simply providing consumers with\nmore information about plans will not neces-\nsarily improve their decisions.13 In particular,\nmore effective methods for explaining plans as\ncare delivery systems are needed, as well as\ninformation that allows consumers to evaluate\nthe trade-offs among access, cost, and quality.\nMoreover, the delivery-system aspects of\nhealth plans may become more complex as a\nresult of recent trends toward more \"open-\naccess\" models of care and patients' rights leg-\nislation that mandates greateraccess to physi-\ncians both inside and outside of a plan's net-\nwork. In other words, many plans that\npreviously had no coverage for out-of-\nnetwork services or self-referred specialty\ncare may loosen these restrictions by imple-\nmenting complex rules for when these restric-\ntions do not apply or for when there is full or\npartial coverage. These changes are likely to\nincrease the importance of consumer educa-\ntion, since they may greatly increase the com-\nplexity of plan rules as well as the need for\nconsumers to be aware of changes to their\nown health plan and the health plan market in\ngeneral.\nThe Center for Studying Health System Change is\nsupported in full by the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation.

R. Strouse et al., Report on Survey Methods for the\nHousehold Survey, Technical Publication no. 15\n(Washington: Center for Studying Health Sys-\n3. The question on specialty referral in the house-\nhold survey was originally designed for use in the\nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research\n(AHCPR) Consumer Assessment of Health\nPlans (CAHPS). All other attribute questions\nasked in the household survey were originally\ndesigned for use in the 1996 Medical Expendi-\nture and Panel Survey (MEPS) conducted by the\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality\n(AHRQ). Some questions were modified prior to\ntheir inclusion in the CTS household survey.\n4. Since many health plans offer multiple health\ninsurance \"products\" that differ on the key at-\ntributes of interest in this study, it was necessary\nto identify the specific product in which house-\nhold survey respondents were enrolled. Health\nplan respondents identified the specific product\nbased on the name of the plan, the community of\nresidence for the family respondent, and the\nname of the employer offering the plan, all of\nwhich were obtained from family respondents\nduring the household survey interview. Only\nthose \"products\" that were identified with a high\ndegree of certainty by the health plan respondent\nwere classified as a \"match\" and included in this\nstudy. Plan respondents reported on the attrib-\nutes for each specific product that was matched.\n5. Fifty-three percent of all family-reported plans\nlinked to plans reported on in the follow-back\nsurvey. While statistical imputation and weight-\ning procedures were used to correct for nonre-\nsponse in the follow-back survey to produce na-\ntionally representative estimates of the U.S.\npopulation in various types of plans, we use only\nthe 53 percent of family health plans that actu-\nally linked directly to a plan obtained in the fol-\nlow-back survey. Therefore, the estimates in this\nreport were weighted to correct for the cluster-\ning of the CTS sample in sixty communities,\nmultiple selection of familieswithin households,\nand nonresponse on the CTS household survey.\nHowever, the weights do not correct for nonre-\nsponse in the follow-back survey, nor do they\ncorrect for the selection of the family respondent\nfor use in this analysis. Therefore, caution should\nbe used in making inferences about the total U.S.\npopulation in this analysis.\n6. There was virtually no difference in the accuracy\nof reporting health plan attributes between fam-\nily respondents who reported on only one plan\nand those who reported on several plans.\n7. It is noteworthy that there were more plans that\nrequired primary care provider sign-up than\nthere were plans that required specialty referral\nreports). While one might expect these percent-\nages to be roughly the same, the discrepancy is\nlargely due to point-of-service (POS) plans that\nrequire primary care providers but also allow\nself-referrals for specialty care.\n8. If we assume that three-fourths of those enrolled\nin POS plans who overstated the need for spe-\ncialty referral would havecorrectly answered the\nquestion if it had been identical to the question\nasked of health plans, then the agreement rate for\nthis attribute would increase to 54 percent for\nplans that did not require a referral, and an over-\nall agreement rate of 64 percent. While higher\nthan the actual agreement rates reported in Ex-\nhibit 3, they are still well below agreement rates\nfor other attributes.\n9. Isaacs, \"Consumers' Information Needs.\"\n10. Since some of the low level of agreement on all\nfour attributes may be due to differences be-\ntween the household and plan versions of the\nspecialty referral question, we also calculated\noverall agreement rates excluding the specialty\nreferral attribute. Overall agreement on the other\nthree attributes combined was 43 percent.\n11. Some of the variation in agreement rates by re-\nspondent characteristics may be due to correla-\ntion with other respondent characteristics or the\ntype of plan they are enrolled in. Therefore, cau-\ntion should be used in making causal inferences\nas to the effect of these respondent charac-\nteristics on the accuracy of reporting.\n12. J. Reschovsky and L.
