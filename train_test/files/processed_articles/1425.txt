Socio-economic and lifestyle covariates were derived from questionnaires administered in all four surveys.\nAlmost all deaths were veri\u00aeed by death certi\u00aecates.\nRESULTS: The shape of the morality risk vs baseline BMI curve varied due to a bias (late-life bias) caused by a steep decrease in\nBMI among the elderly toward the end of the lifespan. In a particular analysis, the portion of subjects at baseline who were\ndeceased elderly with lower BMI than age-matched censored subjects indicated the size of the bias, and appeared to be the\nproximate cause. Strong evidence was found to support the proximate cause being the actual cause. Excluding deaths during\nearly follow-up was only able to remove the late-life bias in limited circumstances. Using average-adulthood BMI as mortality\npredictor and baseline BMI as covariate was very effective in removing the late-life bias. It also appeared to remove the reverse-\ncausation and regression-dilution biases, and yielded robustly positive mortality risk vs average-adulthood BMI curves in all\nanalyses in which it was tested.\nCONCLUSIONS: Average-adulthood BMI appears to be an appropriate predictor of mortality risk, provided baseline BMI is used\nas a covariate. Among non-elderly persons, being leaner meant a lower mortality risk, down to the lowest category of leanness in\nthe study \u00d0 ` 20 kgam2. Future survival analyses of the mortality\u00b1BMI relationship should account for the effects of the\nregression-dilution, reverse-causation and late-life biases.\nKeywords: mortality\u00b1BMI relationship; body weight and mortality; NHEFS; leanness; regression-dilution bias;\nreverse-causation bias\nIntroduction\nPrevious studies of the follow-up mortality risk vs baseline\nBMI (body mass index, weight in kilograms per height in\nmeters squared) relationship have yielded con\u00aficting\nresults,1\u00b14 even though most of them excluded deaths\nduring the \u00aerst few years of follow-up, to remove the\nreverse-causation bias.\nBody weight has been shown to vary non-linearly with\nage,5\u00b17 consequently a one-time BMI measurement at base-\nline is probably an unreliable measure of average BMI\nthroughout the lifespan. Conceptually, average-adulthood\nBMI is the appropriate predictor of mortality risk, because\nmajor killer diseases such as cardiovascular disease develop\nthroughout adulthood. Also, using average-adulthood BMI\nshould remove the regression-dilution bias,8,9 which most\nprevious studies have not done.\nThe objective of the present study was to develop a valid\nmeasure of average-adulthood BMI using the longitudinal\nbody-weight data in the 20 y First National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up\n*Correspondence: JA Greenberg, Department of Health and Nutrition\nSciences, Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, NY 11210, USA.\nE-mail: jamesg@brooklyn.cuny.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nStudy (NHEFS), and to assess the effects of both baseline BMI\nand average-adulthood BMI on mortality risk.\nMethods\nNHEFS\nNHEFS is a longitudinal study of the persons aged 25\u00b174 y\nHealth and Examination Survey (NHANES I), a probability-\nsample survey of the civilian United-States noninstitutiona-\nlized population.10,11 NHEFS contains a series or follow-up\nsurveys,12,13 four of which have been completed. The \u00aerst\nThe second, in 1986, only included NHEFS subjects who\nPredictor variables and their accuracy\ncorrelation was high (Spearman's rho  0.98), suggesting\naccurate.\nrecalled estimates.13 Recalled estimates were used because\nmeasured values (Spearman's rho  0.73). Two steps were\ntaken to help ensure accurate average-adulthood BMI data:\n(1) obvious outliers were excluded; and (2) an internal-\nvalidity test was conducted. This test involved assessing\nagreement between average-adulthood BMIs calculated via\ntwo different methods. Both methods used all measured\nestimates of maximum and minimum weights, and ages at\nmaximum and minimum weights, were used in the \u00aerst\nmethod. Outlier subjects were those with grossly inaccurate\nestimates, such as estimated maximum weight being less\nmethod. Outlier subjects were those with current estimate\ntwo sets of average-adulthood BMIs were highly correlated\nthey were accurate enough for assessing the shape of the\nmortality risk vs average-adulthood BMI curve.\nAll average-adulthood BMIs used here were calculated\nusing the \u00aerst method, because the second method did not\nBMIs were calculated as weight in kilograms divided by\nEnd points\nEach death was con\u00aermed either by death certi\u00aecate or\nproxy interview.13 Death certi\u00aecates were obtained for a\nhigh proportion of subjects. For instance, in the 1992\nsurvey certi\u00aecates were obtained for 98.7% of subjects\nknown to have died since previous contact.13 Cause of\ndeath was determined from the death certi\u00aecate, and\ncoded using International Classi\u00aecation of Diseases, Ninth\nRevision (ICD-9)15 categories.\nFor Cox's regression analyses, all-cause mortality included\nall deaths not due to motor-vehicle accidents (ICD-9 codes\nCovariates\nThe following covariates, derived from subjects' responses to\nsurvey questions, were used in all Cox's regression analyses:\ngender; race (white, African-American and other); educa-\ntional level (continuous, 35 levels); per-capita income (con-\ntinuous, family income divided by number of household\nmembers); smoking (never smoker, former smoker, currently\nsmokes ` 1 packaday, currently smokes  1 packaday); alco-\nhol consumption (` 12 drinksay, monthly, weekly, daily);\nphysical activity (\u00aeve categories, based on subjects' esti-\nmates of intensity of usual daily activities and recreational\nactivity).\nStatistical methods\nThe t-test for independent samples, adjusted for unequal\nvariances where necessary, was used to assess the signi\u00aecance\nof differences between deceased and censored (survived or\nlost to follow-up) subjects in baseline BMI, shown by means\nof asterisks in Figure 2.\nCox's proportional-hazards regression analysisl6 was used\nto analyze the simultaneous multivariate relationships\nbetween mortality risk and baseline BMI and average-adult-\nhood BMI, after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle\ncovariates. Cumulative hazard plots provided no evidence\nagainst proportionality assumptions. The Wald statistic for\nthe B coef\u00aecient for the continuous version of BMI as\npredictor variable was used as a test of the direction and\nsigni\u00aecance of the trend between adjusted mortality risk and\nBMI, reported in Figures 1 and 5, and the likelihood-ratio test\nwas used to assess goodness of \u00aet of regression models17. For\nall regression models containing both average-adulthood\nBiases in mortality risk vs BMI curve\nJA Greenberg\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nBMI and baseline BMI (Figure 5), the Tolerance Statistic18 was\nfound to be greater than 0.30, and the Pearson's correlation\ncoef\u00aecient between these two variables was found to be less\nthan 0.84, indicating no multicollinearity effects. Tests of\nsigni\u00aecance were two sided, and used the 5% level.\nResults\nsurveys who were in the Cox's regression analyses presented\nbelow.\nFigure 1 presents the result of Cox's regression analyses of\nthe relationship between all-cause mortality risk and base-\nthe 20 y NHEFS follow-up period with deaths during the \u00aerst\n14 y excluded, whereas no deaths were excluded in the\nline and a 6 y follow up, with no deaths excluded. Figure 1\nshows that the mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve had a\nvariety of shapes in NHEFS, depending on baseline, follow-\nup period, and whether early deaths were excluded. The\n0\u00b16 curve was negative. This is consonant with the variety of\nsuch shapes found in follow-up studies.1\u00b14\nFigure 2, a plot of longitudinal BMI data vs age, by survival\nmate within 5% of measured value.

In a particular survival analysis, it was\nthe portion of subjects at baseline who were deceased elderly\nsubjects with lower BMI than age-matched censored subjects\nwhich indicated the size of the bias. This is referred to as the\nproximate cause. Figure 3 shows the size of the proximate\ncause in the analyses reported here. The proximate cause was\nbecause average baseline BMI was higher for deceased than\ncensored subjects at all ages (Figure 3A), and this analysis\nyielded no bias (positive mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve\nin Figure 1A). The proximate cause was relatively small for\nwas lower for deceased than censored subjects for a relatively\nsmall portion of subjects at baseline, those over the age of\nabout 67 y (Figure 3B), and this analysis yielded a relatively\nsmall bias ( J-shaped in Figure 1B). Similarly the proximate\naverage baseline BMI was lower for deceased than censored\nsubjects for all subjects at baseline (Figure 3D) and this\nanalysis yielded a very large bias (negative in Figure 1C).\nThis evidence suggests that the proximate cause and the bias\nwere associated in a dose\u00b1response manner.\nTwo strategies were tested for removing the late-life bias.\nThe \u00aerst was excluding deaths during the \u00aerst few years of\nfollow-up, the strategy used to remove the reverse-causation\nbias, which is caused because fatal chronic disease decreases\nBMI and simultaneously increases mortality risk.19 This\nstrategy was of limited effectiveness.

However, excluding deaths during less than the \u00aerst 14 y\ndid not remove the bias (results not shown).\nTable 1 Characteristics of all NHEFS subjects in 1971 \u00b1 1975, and of subjects selected for Cox's regression analyses (mean (s.d.))\nRace\nSmoking levelg\nbn was different for these three samples because only subjects with valid values for all variables were included in each Cox's regression analysis. In the 1971 \u00b1 1975,\n0 \u00b1 20 survey, for instance, subjects recalled estimates of body weights were only obtained for 3494 of the 7574 subjects for whom smoking had been assessed.

This\ngraphs of average-adulthood BMI, adjusted for baseline\nBMI, vs age level by survival status in these analyses,\nshowed no evidence of the proximate cause. This strategy\nalso yielded bias-free, positive mortality risk vs average-\nadulthood BMI relationships in both analyses, as shown\nin Figure 5, which presents the results of the corresponding\nCox's regression analyses. Including both average-adult-\nhood BMI and baseline BMI yielded signi\u00aecantly better\n\u00aetting models than including only average-adulthood\nBMI or only baseline BMI (data not shown). This suggests\nthat both average-adulthood BMI and baseline BMI have\nsigni\u00aecant independent effects on mortality risk, and\nincluding both in the Cox's regression model effectively\nseparates their independent effects. Similar results were\ncardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality (results\nnot shown).\nIn addition, because 1986 baseline BMI was used in\ncalculating 1986 average-adulthood BMI, analyses were con-\nducted to assess whether using these two measures together\nanalysis. The analysis was repeated twice using: (1) 1982\nhood BMI as mortality predictor, because neither the 1982,\nBoth of these analyses yielded mortality risk vs average-\nadulthood curves which were very similar to those using\naverage-adulthood BMI introduced no artifacts.\nDiscussion\nThe late-life bias is different from the reverse-causation\nbias,19 for several reasons. First, conceptually, the reverse-\ncausation bias occurs at all ages, while the late-life bias only\noccurs if the proximate cause exists, ie if at baseline subjects\nare mixed-age adults, a sizeable portion of whom are\nelderly. Second, empirically, excluding deaths during the\n\u00aerst few years of follow-up, traditionally used to remove the\nreverse-causation bias, was only able to remove the prox-\nshown in Figures 3A and 1A) of the four analyses in which\nFigure 3 Baseline BMI vs age, by survival status, at different baselines, showing the effect of excluding deaths during early follow-up, in two different\nfollow-up analyses in the NHEFS. Age levels in Figure 3A and 3B are deciles with the \u00aerst four deciles combined.\nBiases in mortality risk vs BMI curve\nJA Greenberg\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nit was tested. This \u00aending accords with previously pub-\nlished studies which found that excluding deaths during\nthe \u00aerst few years of follow-up is only effective in yielding a\npositive mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve in a small\nportion of survival analyses.1,4 One of the previously pub-\nlished studies in which it was successful was the Nurses\nHealth Study,20 in which subjects were all under the age of\n55 y. It seems likely that the subjects in this study were too\nyoung to exhibit the proximate cause or, therefore, the late-\nlife bias.\nThe evidence for the existence of the late-life bias, as\npresented in the Results section, above, is strong: (1) a\nplausible causal mechanism, with a proposed proximate\ncause; (2) the bias existed in all four analyses in which the\nproximate cause existed; (3) the bias was removed in all\nseven analyses in which the proximate cause was removed;\nand (4) some evidence that there is a dose\u00b1response relation-\nship between the proximate cause and the late-life bias.\nIt seems likely that the strategy of using average adult-\nhood BMI as mortality predictor and baseline BMI as covari-\nate is effective in simultaneously removing the late-life,\nreverse-causation and regression-dilution bias, for several\nreasons. First, conceptually: (1) this strategy removes the-\nlate-life bias because it removes the proximate cause \u00d0 the\nlate-life inverse relationship between mortality risk and base-\nline BMI at low baseline BMI; (2) it should remove the\nreverse-causation bias, because it should remove the inverse\nrelationship between mortality risk and baseline BMI due\nto fatal chronic disease for all subjects; and (3) it should\nremove the regression-dilution bias, because average-adult-\nhood BMI is a good measure of a subject's usual BMI.8,9\nSecond, this strategy removed the proximate cause (eg\nFigure 4), and yielded apparently bias-free, positive mortality\nrisk vs average adulthood BMI curves in all six analyses in\nFigure 4 Average-adulthood BMI, adjusted for baseline BMI, vs age, by\nsurvival status, at two different surveys in the NHEFS. Average-adulthood\nBMI was adjusted by conducting linear regression with average-adult-\nhood BMI as dependent variable and baseline BMI as independent\nvariable, and then using the unstandardized residuals as adjusted\naverage-adulthood BMI. Age levels in Figure 4A are deciles, with the\n\u00aerst four deciles combined.\nFigure 5 Adjusted relative risk of all-cause mortality vs average-adult-\nhood BMI in two different follow-up analyses in the NHEFS. Relative risk\nwas adjusted for the demographic and lifestyle covariates described in\nMethods in the text, and for baseline BMI. Bars represent 95% con-\n\u00aedence intervals. The lowest BMI category is the reference category for\nboth graphs.\nBiases in mortality risk vs BMI curve\nJA Greenberg\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nwhich it was tested in the present study (eg Figure 5). Third,\npositive mortality risk vs average-adulthood BMI curve\n(Figure 5A) than did excluding deaths during the \u00aerst 14 y\nin the mortality risk vs baseline BMI curve (Figure 1A) \u00d0\nprobably because the latter analysis was unable to remove\nthe effects of the regression-dilution bias.8,9\nThe cause of the decrease in BMI among the elderly\n(Figure 2) is probably mostly chronic fatal disease wast-\ning.21,22 However, other factors, not associated with poor\nhealth, may also play a role.22 These include sarcopenia,21\nbone-mineral density loss,23,24 and intentional weight\nOne of the important implications of the present study\nand previously published studies is that a one-point (base-\nline) determination of BMI is not a reliable mortality pre-\ndictor in follow-up survival analyses of the mortality risk vs\nBMI relationship. A one-point determination does not allow\nfor: (1) assessment of the effect of average BMI throughout\nadulthood on mortality risk throughout adulthood, as\nwas done here; (2) effective removal of the late-life bias if\nsubjects are mixed-age adults at baseline, as shown here and\nelsewhere;1,4 (3) removal of the regression-dilution bias for\nsubjects at any age;8,9 and (4) a comprehensive analysis of\nthe causal relationships between mortality risk and BMI\namong the elderly.22 It seems as if BMI determinations at\nseveral different points during adulthood are needed for\nrigorous analyses of the relationship between mortality risk\nand BMI.\nSeveral caveats seem important. The effects of dietary\nintake were not assessed. Also, some of the weights used to\ncalculate BMI data were estimated by subjects, and that is\na potential limitation. However, there was evidence that\nweight-estimation errors would not invalidate any of the\n\u00aendings of the present study. Current estimates have been\nused in most follow-up studies of the body weight-mortality\nrelationship,2,26\u00b135 and have been found to be accurate. For\ninstance, the correlation between currently estimated and\nmeasured weights was reported to be 0.96 in the Nurses\nestimation measurement differences were found to be almost\nall negative (underestimates), and within 1.6% of measured\nvalues. Such small estimation errors could have very little\neffect on the shapes of the mortality risk vs baseline BMI\ncurves in Figure 1.\nRecalled estimated have also been found to be accurate\nenough for use in follow-up studies.22 For instance, the\ncorrelation between estimated and measured weights at age\n(Spearman's rho), respectively. The estimate-measurement\ndifferences found here were also small \u00d0 means of 1.33%,\nevidence of the pattern of bias found in several previously\npublished studies: slight overestimation by lean subjects, and\nbias could cause slight steepening of the positive mortality\nrisk vs average-adulthood BMI curves reported here, predo-\nminantly at high BMI, but could not change the positive\nshape.\nIn conclusion, after the effects of the inverse association\nbetween BMI and mortality risk among the elderly toward\nthe end of the lifespan were statistically removed, increasing\nmortality risk was associated with increasing average-adult-\nhood BMI, down to the lowest BMI category in the present\nstudy (` 20 kgam2). It con\u00aermed by future studies, this\nmeans that for non-elderly persons, being leaner lowers\nmortality risk, down to low level of leanness. It is recom-\nmended that future investigations of the mortality risk vs\nBMI relationship account for the effects of the regression-\ndilution, reverse-causation, and late-life biases.\n"
