To test this, we looked at the relationships among rater-judged\nhumor, general intelligence, and the Big Five personality traits in a sample of 185 college-\nage students (115 women, 70 men). General intelligence positively predicted rater-judged\nhumor, independent of the Big Five personality traits. Extraversion also predicted rater-\njudged humor, although to a lesser extent than general intelligence. General intelligence did\nnot interact with the sex of the participant in predicting rating scores on the humor\nproduction tasks. The current study lends support to the prediction that effective humor\nproduction acts as an honest indicator of intelligence in humans. In addition, extraversion,\nand to a lesser extent, openness, may reflect motivational traits that encourage humor\nproduction.\n",

More importantly, Miller sees effective humor\nproduction as a strategy to communicate underlying genetic quality with respect to\npsychological traits. Of these traits, general intelligence emerges as one of the most\ncomprehensive and heritable psychological constructs (Jensen, 1998). General intelligence\nhas also been found to show strong correlations to other indicators of genetic quality, such\nphysiological symmetry (Bates, 2007; Luxen and Buunk, 2006; Prokosch, Yeo, and Miller,\n2004), and developmental stability (Thoma et al., 2005). Thus, Miller's model posits that\nsome of the individual differences in humor production will reflect differences in general\nintelligence and its underlying genetic fitness. As a result, a preference for humor in\npotential mates, and a motivation to produce displays of effective humor in courtship and\nsocial settings, serves an adaptive purpose because effective humor is an honest and\nThe importance of humor in mate preference is supported in a number of self-report\n(Bressler and Balshine, 2006; Bressler et al., 2006) studies of mating preferences. In\naddition, mate preferences for intelligence are also well established (Buss, 1989, 1994;\nRegan and Joshi, 2003). If humor is an honest signal of intelligence and Miller's model of\nhumor is correct, then intelligence and humor should be positively correlated. However,\nonly two studies have explicitly looked at the relationship between humor and intelligence.\nFeingold and Mazzella (1991) found a positive correlation between measured verbal\nintelligence and rater-judged humor production in a college age sample (r = .40). Masten\n(1986) reported substantial positive correlations among IQ, academic achievement, and\nThe current study investigates the relationship between general intelligence and\nrater-judged humor production, with a few key differences from the aforementioned\nstudies. The current method provides a clearer estimation of general intelligence relative to\nthe Feingold and Mazzella (1991) study, and unlike the pre-adolescent sample in the\nMasten (1986) study, the college-age sample is consistent with Miller's model that costly\ndisplays of humor would manifest primarily during peak reproductive years (Miller,\n2000c). We assessed humor with open-ended verbal and drawing tasks and measure\ngeneral intelligence using an 18-item version of the Raven's Advanced Progressive\nMatrices (Raven, Raven, and Court, 1998). In addition, we included a Big Five personality\nassessment to look at how personality traits are related to humor production. Previous\nresearch has found that openness has shown a significant positive relationship to general\nShafer, 1999) and finding a positive relationship to humor production would lend support\nto Miller's model. Furthermore, these personality traits will serve as useful control\nvariables to see if the role of intelligence is a unique predictor of humor production. These\nfindings represent a key step in assessing a key prediction of Miller's model, and may help\nelucidate the evolutionary basis of humor.\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and procedures\nOne hundred and eighty-five undergraduate students (115 women, 70 men; Mean\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach (CSULB), and Saddleback Community College\n(SCC) voluntarily completed a paper and pencil questionnaire. All students participated in\npartial fulfillment of course credit. Participants completed the questionnaires under\nconditions of complete confidentiality and anonymity. The CSULB Institutional Review\nBoard approved all materials and procedures in the study.\nIndividual difference measures\nAll participants provided general demographic information such as age, sex,\nethnicity, sexual orientation, height, weight, and basic academic history. General\nintelligence was measured using an 18-item version of the Raven's Advanced Progressive\nMatrices (Miller and Tal, 2007; Raven et al., 1998). The Raven's Progressive Matrices test\nhas been shown to have a high factor loading (.60) with general intelligence (Marshalek,\nLohman, and Snow, 1983), and published test reliability scores on the 12-item short form\nof the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices range from  = .66 to .73, compared to  =\nRaven, and Court, 1998). Score distributions of the 18-item Raven's Advanced\nProgressive Matrices from the samples studied are as follows: CSULB participants (n =\nto those reported in the normative sample of Arthur, Tubre, Paul, and Sanchez-Ku (1999).\nPersonality was measured using a 50-item version taken from the International\nPersonality Item Pool (IPIP; Goldberg et al., 2006). Drawing from constructs similar to\nthose in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa and McCrae, 1982), the\nIPIP scale assessed the Big-Five personality traits (with corresponding internal\nconsistencies in the current sample): openness ( = .69), conscientiousness ( = .85),\nextraversion ( = .89), agreeableness ( = .75), and neuroticism ( = .85). All IPIP items\nused can be found at http://ipip.ori.org/newNEODomainsKey.htm.\nHumor production tasks\nTo measure humor, we used an open-ended response format designed to give the\nparticipant the opportunity to display humorous content in a loosely-restricted template.\nBefore engaging in the tasks, participants were instructed to produce humorous content\nwith the knowledge that it would be read and judged by anonymous raters. Participants\nwere asked to complete three different tasks, each designed to measure different aspects of\nhumor production. The latter two tasks were adopted and revised from creativity measures\nThe first task consisted of six character profile forms to be filled in by the\nparticipant (Figure 1). This task was designed to measure verbal humor in the context of\nwitty stereotypes and references. Each profile contained an individual portrait photograph\n(three male and three female portraits in all) along with general headings (e.g., name,\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\noccupation, typical day) to help create a mock description of the individual in the\nphotograph. All six individuals portrayed in the character profile task were friends of the\nauthor, and gave written consent to use their photograph. None of the individuals portrayed\nhad any knowledge of or relationship to any potential participant currently attending\nFigure 1. Sample character profile humor task\n_________________________________________________________________________\nPortrait inserted here\nName: _______________________________\nOccupation: _______________________________\nAbout Me: ________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\nHobbies/Activities: __________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________\nMy Typical Day: __________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________\nPhilosophy on Life: __________________________________________________\nThe second task consisted of three questions to be answered by the participant\n(Figure 2). This task was designed to measure verbal humor in the context of sarcastic\nand/or disparaging responses. The instructions on this subset present the questions as a\nhypothetical e-mail from a friend asking for humorous responses geared at finding\ndifferences in types of humor.\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nFigure 2. E-mail response humor task\n_________________________________________________________________________\nFor this task, I want you to imagine that you've just received an e-mail by a fellow\nstudent asking if you could write some responses to the questions posed below. Your\nfellow student mentions that this is for a school project on the diversity of humorous\nresponses, and asks that you try to write something funny for each question.\nQuestion 1: \"If you could experience what it's like to be a different kind of animal for a\nday, what kind would of animal would you not want to be, and why?\"\nQuestion 2: \"How would you make a marriage exciting after the first couple of years?\"\nQuestion 3: \"What do you think the world will be like in a hundred years?\"\nThe third task measured non-verbal humor. Participant's created a total of eight\nhumorous drawings of different types of animals and people (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Drawing humor task\n_________________________________________________________________________\nPage 1 (Animal drawings, \u00bc page each):\nIn each of the four spaces below, draw the funniest, most amusing-looking depiction\nof each animal that you can\nPicture 1: Monkey\nPicture 2: Penguin\nPicture 3: Octopus\nPicture 4: Giraffe\nPage 2 (Human drawings, \u00bc page each):\nIn each of the four spaces below, draw the funniest, most amusing-looking depiction\nof each person that you can\nPicture 1: Politician\nPicture 2: Professor\nPicture 3: Body-builder\nPicture 4: Artist\nHumor judges\nTwenty-eight undergraduate and graduate student volunteers (14 women, 14 men;\nLong Beach rated the humor production tasks. Students recruited from Introductory\nPsychology classes did so in partial fulfillment of psychology course credit requirements.\nJudges completed all ratings under conditions of complete confidentiality and anonymity.\nIn addition, all ratings were done independently, blindly, and without any explicit\nknowledge of the participant's sex, intelligence, personality, or other information.\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nHumor ratings\nEach participant's six character profiles, three e-mail response answers, and two\npages of humorous drawings (four drawings per page) were rated independently by four\njudges (two women and two men) on a 1-7 humor scale (e.g., 1 = \"not funny at all,\" 4 =\n\"Moderately Funny,\" and 7 = \"Hilarious\"). To keep the number of ratings done per judge\nmanageable, ratings were done in blocks, such that each judge provided humor scores for\nblocks of 22 \u00ad 35 participants. All judges were randomly assigned to fill the requisite slots\nin each rating block. In all, seven rating blocks were used to provide humor scores for the\ntotal amount of participants. Humor was not formally defined for the judges.\nResults\nHumor ratings\nLooking at the distribution of raw rating scores, the majority of aggregated ratings\nDistributional properties of the humor ratings showed a slight positive skew and no clear\nkurtosis. Our first concern was to see if judges were interpreting the 1-7 humor scale in a\nconsistent manner. We first compared the seven rating blocks using a one-way ANOVA,\nfinding a significant difference in raw mean humor scores between rating blocks, F(6, 178)\n= 19.03 (p = .000). We subsequently looked at raw mean humor scores of the four judges\nwithin each rating block, finding significant differences in all seven rating blocks (all ps <\n.01). In order to correct for differences in scale usage, we standardized all of the ratings\ngiven by each judge.\nInter-rater reliabilities were then computed for the four judges within each rating\nblock. We first computed the inter-rater reliability for each of the eleven humor task items\nindividually, finding an average Cronbachs Alpha () = .58 and average inter-rater\ncorrelation ( r\ni\n) = .28 across all seven rating blocks. Although these reliabilities are below\nthe commonly accepted reliability criterion for psychological measurements, they are\nconsistent with past humor production measures (Feingold and Mazzella, 1991; K\u00f6hler and\nRuch, 1996; Masten, 1986), and possibly reflect the varied nature of humor preferences.\nNext, we looked at inter-rater reliabilities among mean scores of each humor subtask across\nall seven rating blocks, with  = .72 and r\ni\n= .39 for the six character profiles,  = .63 and\nr\ni\n= .32 for the three e-mail responses, and  = .71 and r\ni\n= .40 for the two pages of\nhumorous drawings. Finally, we looked at entire humor task including all 11 items, with \ni\nA factor analysis on all 11 items was analyzed using principal components and\npromax rotation in SPSS. Looking strictly at factor loadings, a verbal and drawing factor\nseemed to emerge. Upon further analysis, indications from the scree plot (Figure 4)\nsuggested only one predominant factor, where the first factor accounted for 49% of the\nvariance while the second accounted for 10%.\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nFigure 4. Scree Plot on humor item factor loadings (Using Principal Components and\nPromax rotation)\nIn addition, the component correlation matrix showed an r = .61 between the two\nfactors. Thus, the mean score of all 11 items (which we refer to as \"humor production\")\nwas used as the quantitative basis for the humor construct, as it accounted for the most\nvariance in the factor analysis and showed the highest and most consistent inter-rater\nreliability across the seven rating blocks. In Table 1, we have included a factor loading plot\nwith both factors because we believe that if the drawing tasks were given equal weighting\nto the other tasks, a two factor solution would have emerged. We have also included item\ncorrelations with our main predictor of intelligence.\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nTable 1.

Of note, humor scores were\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nsignificantly and positively correlated with general intelligence, openness, extraversion,\nheight, and weight. None of the variables in Table 2 showed any significant non-linear\nrelationships.\nWe were interested in the significant correlations of weight and height to humor\nproduction, and decided to calculate a body mass index (BMI) variable. Despite the\nsignificant correlations in height and weight, BMI did not correlate with humor production,\nHumor production multiple regression\nTo analyze key predictors of humor production, we entered ten variables into\nmultiple regression: general intelligence, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,\nagreeableness, neuroticism, age, height, weight, and number of semesters in college.\nStandardized beta weights and significance levels are shown in Table 3, with both general\nintelligence and extraversion being significant and unique predictors of humor production.\nTable 3.

This result is consistent with previous studies on sex\ndifferences in humor (Thorson and Powell, 1993b; Ziv, 1984) as well as Miller's sexual\nselection model that reproductive benefits for humorous displays would be greater for\nmales than females (Miller, 2000c). Table 4 displays the bivariate correlations showing sex\ndifferences with regard to humor production.\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nTable 4. Sex differences in bivariate correlations (All male correlations are shown in bold)\nHumor Intelligence Openness\n* = significant at p < .05 ** = significant at p < .01\nWe ran a moderated regression to understand if the relationship of general\nintelligence to humor production depended on sex. Counter to Miller's prediction that male\ndisplays of humor, being more effective, will have a stronger relationship with general\n.22), although this interaction was not statistically significant ( = -.11, t(181) = -.70, p =\n.49). We also ran a moderated regression on openness, as it also showed sex differences in\nconsistent with Miller's prediction, although openness can only be considered an indirect\nassessment of intelligence. We should also note that there were no significant interactions\nwith respect to the sex of the judges on any of the relationships to humor production.\nDiscussion\nConsistent with the previous research on humor and intelligence (Feingold and\nMazzella, 1991; Masten, 1986), we found that humorous pictures and stories created by\nindividuals higher on general intelligence are rated as being funnier. This result holds after\ncontrolling for Big Five personality factors. Although females showed a stronger\nrelationship of humor production to general intelligence than males, which ran counter to\nour expectations, this difference was not significant.\nThe relationship of humor production to extraversion is also consistent with\nprevious research (K\u00f6hler and Ruch, 1992; Thorson and Powell, 1993b). The current study\nshowed that extraversion corresponds to facets of sociability (e.g., \"have a lot to say\", \"feel\ncomfortable around people\"), dominance (e.g., \"like to draw attention to myself\"), and\nactive sensation seeking (e.g., \"am the life of the party\"). With respect to reproductive\nfitness, recent evidence found that extraversion has a consistent cross-cultural relationship\nwith short-term mating success (Schmitt and Shackelford, 2008). Although openness\nshowed a significant bivariate correlation with humor production, particularly in males, this\neffect was diminished when observed in the multiple regression analysis and did not show\nany significant relationship with intelligence. Despite this, the similar bivariate\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\ncorrelations of humor production to both extraversion and openness may be indicative of\ntendencies for exploratory behaviors, cognitive flexibility, and desire for novelty found in\nthe higher-order \"plasticity\" dimension (see DeYoung, Peterson, and Higgins, 2002). This\nsuggests that humor production has a social component distinct from its cognitive\nrelationship, and we speculate that this social component is tied to the motivation to\nproduce humor displays in social contexts.\nOur preliminary findings support Miller's contention that humor evolved as an\nhonest display of general intelligence in humans. In turn, individual differences in humor\nproduction taps into the large portion of heritable mental abilities that make up general\nintelligence, with humor appreciation (as rated by the humor judges in this study) reflecting\nin rating humor production has been an issue here and in other studies (see Feingold and\nMiller's model that humor appreciation is consistent enough between individuals to reliably\nindicate any other individual differences in humor producers.\nLimitations and future directions\nThe current study only assessed one particular facet of humor production\u00adwritten\nand drawn forms of creative stereotypes and descriptive statements. To preserve\nparticipant confidentiality and anonymity, as well as methodological feasibility,\necologically valid aspects of humor production, such as social setting, interpersonal\nrelations, shared knowledge, and spontaneity had to be sacrificed. As a result, participants\nand judges may have been less motivated to produce and appreciate humor, respectively,\nleading to decreased power to detect actual individual differences in humor production.\nThus, the construct of humor investigated here may give only a partial glimpse into the\nphenomenon of humor and how it relates to other patterns of individual differences. Future\nstudies investigating more ecologically valid measures of humor (e.g., observational\nstudies) and self-report measures of humor production (see Thorson and Powell, 1993a)\nwould broaden the scope of the current study. In addition, our study did not investigate\nheritable biological fitness in terms of genetic quality or overall health, and further research\non the relationship of humor production to other fitness-related constructs will be necessary\nto understand the full breadth of humor production as a fitness indicator.\nAnother limitation came from partitioning humor ratings into blocks instead of\nhaving each rater judge the entire sample of humor tasks, which may have weakened the\nconsistency and reliability of the rating process. However, the alternative method of\nhaving fewer raters judge the entire sample of humor tasks also has a potential cost of not\nrepresenting the varied nature of humor preferences, making this issue difficult to resolve\nwithout extensive resources. Furthermore, due to the pencil and paper format of the humor\ntasks, there is a possibility that raters may have inferred the sex of the participant by their\npenmanship, which may have biased their subsequent rating for the humor task.\nWith respect to Miller's notion that the primary function of humor is to display\nintelligence during courtship (Miller, 2000a), the humor tasks in the current study were not\ndesigned to assess courtship-motivated humor. In our case, the types of humor used may\nreflect content that extends outside of a courtship context. Distinguishing the types of\nhumor used for courtship from those used in non-courtship social interactions may reveal\ndifferences and similarities between social and sexual selection strategies, and how humor\nHumor as a mental fitness indicator\nmay be strategically manipulated to serve different adaptive functions (see Griskevicius et\nSummary\nThe current study serves as an exploratory glimpse into the evolutionary basis of\nhumor. Our findings are consistent with the idea that humor is a signal--an honest\nadvertisement of underlying cognitive ability and fitness--and that it continues to serve this\nfunction today. However, much more research will be needed to understand its\nevolutionary origins and why it is so pervasive in human social interactions.\n"
