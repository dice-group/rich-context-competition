Object-choice tasks, which\nhave commonly been used to test whether an animal is able to infer the mental state of a\nhuman experimenter based on a gestural cue, provide one potential means of testing these\nanimals using a similar paradigm. The current study used an object-choice task to examine\nwhether the corvid, Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), is able to use a cognitive\nstrategy to discriminate between the knowledge states of two human experimenters. One\nexperimenter was informed, and the other uninformed, as to the location of a food reward\nhidden inside one of two opaque containers. During the Uninformed Gesture condition, the\nnutcrackers were given probe tests during which only the person performing as the\nuninformed experimenter provided a gesture. Thus, the nutcrackers could not use the\nexperimenter's gesture to reliably find the food. During the Gesture Conflict condition, the\nnutcrackers were presented with a cue conflict. During probe tests, both the informed and\nthe uninformed experimenter gestured to separate containers. Thus, to find the food the\nnutcrackers had to use the gesture from the informed experimenter and refrain from using\nthe gesture of the uninformed experimenter. Our results showed that when the uninformed\nexperimenter's gesture was presented alone, the birds continued to follow the gesture even\nthough it was not consistently predictive of the food's location. However, when provided\nwith two conflicting gestures, as a group the nutcrackers responded to the gesture of the\ninformed experimenter at above chance levels. These results suggest that the birds had\nlearned that the gesture was informative, perhaps by associative learning, yet when this\nmechanism was not reliable the nutcrackers were able to use either the human\nexperimenters' presence/absence during the baiting process, or possibly their knowledge\nstates, to determine which gesture to rely upon.\n",

These\ncognitive similarities include many aspects of their social cognition. As evidence for their\ncomplex social cognitive abilities, primates have been reported to take into account various\naspects of an observer to guide their own behavior, including: sensitivity to others'\nattentional state (Flombaum and Santos, 2005; Hare, Call, Agnetta, and Tomasello, 2000;\nHare, Call, and Tomasello, 2006; Maclean and Hare, 2012; Santos, Nissen, and Ferrugia,\n2006), knowledge state (Hare, Call, and Tomasello, 2001; Kaminski, Call, and Tomasello,\n2008; Marticorena, Ruiz, Mukerji, Goddu, and Santos, 2011), or dominance status (Hare et\nal., 2000, 2001). Likewise, research examining the caching-related behaviors of corvids has\nshown these birds to be capable of similar social cognition. Corvids modify their caching\nand retrieval behavior depending on whether or not they have been observed, both in\nnatural settings (Bugnyar and Kotrschal, 2002; Heinrich and Pepper, 1998; James and\n2006; Emery, Dally, and Clayton, 2004). When another individual is present, many corvids\nwill cache in areas where the observer would have reduced visual access to the cache\nlocation, such as behind obstructions (ravens: Bugnyar and Kotrschal, 2002) or in shaded\nareas (scrub jays: Dally, Emery, and Clayton, 2004). Ravens also preferentially cache when\nan observer is distracted or inattentive (Heinrich and Pepper, 1998). Additionally, if\nwitnessed making a cache, corvids have been shown to re-cache their food when the\nobserving bird has left the area (scrub jays: Emery et al., 2004) or to preferentially retrieve\ncaches when a competitor is knowledgeable of the cache location (ravens: Bugnyar, 2011;\nBugnyar and Heinrich, 2005; Clark's nutcrackers: Clary and Kelly, 2011; scrub jays: Dally,\nEmery, and Clayton, 2006). These strategies have been shown to be flexible as they are\ndifferentially applied depending on the identity and dominance status of the specific\nobserver. Ravens, for instance, delay pilfering cached food in the presence of a dominant\ncaching bird (Bugnyar and Heinrich, 2006). Scrub jays show increased cache protection\nwhen in the presence of dominant birds and preferentially engage in cache protection from\nindividuals that witnessed their caching (Dally et al., 2006). Furthermore, the cache\nprotection behaviors of scrub jays have been shown to depend on the initial acquisition of\nexperience as a pilferer, potentially representing a form of experience projection (Emery\nThese findings suggest that corvids are sensitive to what other individuals see and\nknow, and also recognize that other individuals may have intentions to steal their food.\nThese cognitive skills may be similar to those shown by primates. However, research\ninvestigating the complex social cognition abilities of corvids has primarily focused on the\ndomain of food caching (Grodzinski and Clayton, 2010), with few studies using the same\nexperimental procedures as those with primates. Thus, it is not clear whether the abilities\nshown by corvids are indeed convergent to the abilities shown by primates or if they are\nlimited to food-caching contexts. If corvid social cognition is a more general process, then\ncorvids should be able to use these skills when challenged in non-ecologically relevant\ncontexts and tasks more commonly used to examine primate social cognition.\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nObject-choice tasks provide one approach for exploring whether the abilities shown\nby corvids are in fact indicative of flexible cognitive processes (as opposed to associative\nmechanisms). Typically, during the object-choice task, the subject is required to infer the\nunderlying knowledge state of a human experimenter through the use of the experimenter's\ngestural cue to find a food reward hidden under an opaque container (e.g., primates: Byrnit,\nNieworth, Burman, Basile, and Lickteig, 2002; Peignot and Anderson, 1999; canids:\nSoproni, Mikl\u00f3si, Top\u00e1l, and Cs\u00e1nyi, 2002; Vir\u00e1nyi et al., 2008; cetaceans: Pack and\nHerman, 2004; Tschudin, Call, Dunbar, Harris, and van der Elst, 2001; bats: Hall, Udell,\nRecent studies have begun to examine corvid cognition using non-caching\nprocedures such as the object-choice task. However, results from using this approach have\nbeen conflicted. Using a pointing cue, for example, Schloegl, Kotrschal, and Bugnyar\n(2008) presented ravens with an array of five containers and a human experimenter pointed\nto one previously baited container with his ipsilateral arm. The birds did not choose the\ncontainer being pointed to more often than if no cue was given. Conversely, von Bayern\nand Emery (2009) showed that jackdaws were able to use a pointing cue. However, in this\nstudy the experimenter extended the contralateral arm to indicate which of two containers\nwas baited. It is not known whether this seemingly subtle gestural difference may account\nfor these results. When non-avian species have been tested with both an ipsilateral and\ncontralateral gesture, the results indicate similar comprehension with either gestural form\nShapiro, Janik, and Slater, 2003). If non-avian species are any indication, then the\ndifference between ravens and jackdaws represents a species difference for gesture use\nrather than a methodologically driven difference.\nEye gaze has also been used as a directional cue during object-choice tasks with\ncorvids. Thus far, studies using static eye gaze have shown that corvids may not use this\ncue to guide choices (ravens: Schloegl et al., 2008; rooks: Schmidt, Scheid, Kotrschal,\nBugnar, and Schloegl, 2011; jackdaws: von Bayern and Emery, 2009). However, studies\nusing alternating gaze have produced more accurate choice performance (jackdaws: von\nBayern and Emery, 2009; Clark's nutcrackers: Tornick, Gibson, Kispert, and Wilkinson,\nTornick et al. (2011) reported that Clark's nutcrackers were proficient at using a\nvariety of gestural cues (each examined independently) to find a food reward hidden in one\nof two containers. The nutcrackers were able to use a touch gesture (a baited cup was\ntouched using the ipsilateral arm and picked up by the experimenter) and a pointing gesture\n(the experimenter's ipsilateral arm and finger were directed to a baited cup) to locate the\nfood reward at above chance levels early in testing. With additional training, the\nnutcrackers were also able to use eye gaze as a cue (the experimenter's eyes and head were\nalternated between the bird and the baited cup).\nIn addition to being able to examine gesture use, the object-choice paradigm has the\npotential for investigating whether animals can discriminate between experimenters with\ndifferent knowledge states (e.g., Povinelli, Nelson, and Boyson, 1990; Povinelli, Parks, and\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nchimpanzees to view a situation in which one experimenter witnessed a food reward being\nhidden under an opaque container, whereas a second experimenter was not afforded this\nexperience. The two experimenters then gestured to one of the containers so that the\ninformed experimenter always indicated the correct container and the uninformed\nexperimenter an incorrect container before allowing the chimpanzee to make a choice. The\nchimpanzees preferred the gesture of the informed experimenter. However, this preference\nwas not shown to be present for younger chimpanzees (Povinelli et al., 1994) or rhesus\nAlthough corvids have been studied for their ability to use experimenter-given cues,\nthey have not been examined for their ability to use knowledge states during the object-\nchoice task (such as conducted by Povinelli et al., 1990). However, recent critiques of the\nobject-choice paradigm have posited that the original \"mind-reading\" interpretation of this\ntask are confounded by the alternative explanation that the animal need only to attend to the\nexperimenter's behavioral states to respond correctly (e.g., presence/absence or eye\norientation, see Povinelli and Vonk, 2003, 2004). This criticism is valid. However, the\nobject-choice task still requires an animal to make sophisticated social judgments and\ntherefore remains an informative procedure. We used the object-choice task as a way to\nexamine corvid cognition using a paradigm that is typically administered to primates, as\nwell as to present the birds with a social cognition problem outside of their ecological niche\nof food caching. This affords the opportunity to examine whether corvid social cognition is\nflexible or domain specific. Thus, the current study examined whether Clark's nutcrackers\nare able to discriminate human experimenters based on their knowledge or behavioral states\nduring an object-choice task.\nThe experiment was conducted in two phases. During Phase 1, nutcrackers were\nrequired to locate a hidden food reward by using a combined lookpointtouch gesture\n(from here on referred to simply as \"gesture\") from both a familiar and a novel human\nexperimenter. Phase 1 was conducted to establish that the birds could learn the gesture that\nwould be used in Phase 2.\nDuring Phase 2 of this experiment, the same nutcrackers were required to\ndiscriminate between an informed and uninformed human experimenter, and use only the\ngesture from the experimenter that was informed on any given trial to locate a hidden food\nreward. Therefore, this modified object-choice task was used to examine whether\nnutcrackers are sensitive to the knowledge state or behavioral state of the experimenter. If\nthe nutcrackers' cognitive abilities are indeed representative of flexible and complex\ncognition, then they should be able to solve the social problem presented, despite the non-\necologically relevant (i.e., non-caching) nature of the task.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects\nTen (five male and five female) wild-caught, sexually mature Clark's nutcrackers\n(Nucifraga columbiana) were used in the experiment. Birds had been in captivity for 8-16\nyears and were housed in individual cages (73 cm high x 48 cm wide x 48 cm deep)\nthroughout the experiment. The birds were provided a diet consisting of turkey starter,\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nparrot pellets, sunflower seeds, pine seeds, mealworms, oyster shells, and a vitamin\nsupplement. Each individual was food restricted to 85% of its ad libitum weight for the\nduration of the experiment. All birds had previous experience with spatial and functional\nlateralization tasks. The colony room maintained a 12:12 light-dark cycle with light onset at\n\u00b0C. All housing and experimental conditions were approved\nby the local animal care committee and met the guidelines of the Canadian Council on\nAnimal Care.\nApparatus\nBirds were tested in an experimental cage (66 cm high x 48 cm wide x 48 cm deep)\nsurrounded by curtains to create a uniform environment (200 cm long x 175 cm wide). The\nexperimental cage allowed the birds to make choices through two openings at the front of\nthe cage (see Figure 1). Birds could insert their heads through one opening at a time to\nobtain a food reward from a container situated on a tray (51 cm long x 23 cm wide) outside\nthe cage. Two laterally positioned containers (8.5 cm diameter) were placed in this tray. A\nswivel lid was attached to each of the containers such that the contents could be occluded.\nTo control for odor cues, each container had a layer of pine seeds along the bottom. The\nrest of the volume was filled with grit so that a single pine seed could be placed on the\nsurface of the grit, in view of the test subject, when the container's swivel lid was open.\nThe tray was attached to a pulley system operated by an experimenter located outside of the\ntesting room. This system allowed the experimenter to pull the tray away from the cage\nonce the subject had made a choice. Each trial was viewed and recorded using a Sony Mini\nDV digital videocassette recorder attached to an EverFocus 1/3\" color digital camera\nmounted on the ceiling above the test cage.\nProcedures\nHabituation. Prior to the experiment, the birds were given one container, filled with\ngrit and a food reward, in their home cages so that they could explore the container and\nlearn how to remove the lid to obtain the pine seeds inside. Once birds were readily\napproaching and reliably opening the containers in their home cage, the birds were\nindividually placed in the experimental cage and allowed to select freely from the\ncontainers which were placed flush against the two openings of the experimental cage with\nthe swivel lids opened. On the following 4 days the swivel lids were closed and the birds\nwere allowed to explore the containers and open the lids to retrieve a hidden pine seed from\neach container. Once birds were consistently opening the containers in less than 30 seconds\nthey began participating in the experiment.\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nFigure 1. The front of the experimental cage\nNotes: Two openings were located on either side of the cage to allow the bird access to either of the\ncontainers positioned laterally on the tray outside the cage.\ni) Training. Training procedures for Experiment 1 were similar to those used by\nTornick et al. (2011). During training, birds received one daily session consisting of eight\ntrials (with sessions conducted Monday through Friday each week). During half of the trials\nthe gesture was performed by an experimenter familiar to the birds (herein referred to as\nthe \"familiar experimenter\"). The familiar experimenter had extensive history (~6 months)\nboth feeding and handling the birds. During the other half of the trials the gesture was\nperformed by an experimenter unfamiliar to the birds (herein referred to as the \"novel\nexperimenter\"). The birds had not encountered the novel experimenter prior to the\nexperiment. The trials were counterbalanced and pseudo-randomized so as not to have the\nsame experimenter gesturing during more than two consecutive trials. Familiar and novel\nexperimenters were used to assess whether the birds would show a preference for following\nthe communicative gesture of a known, as opposed to unknown, experimenter as shown by\nDuring training, an experimenter entered the enclosure and stood at a central\nlocation behind the tray. The experimenter then placed an opaque barrier against the front\nof the bird's cage so that the bird could not see the experimenter who proceeded to bait one\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nof the two containers. During half of the trials, the pine seed was placed in the left\ncontainer and during the other half of trials, in the right container. The container was baited\nequally by the familiar and unfamiliar experimenter. The baited side was counterbalanced\nacross trials within each session and pseudo-randomized so that the seed was never baited\nin the same container for more than two consecutive trials.\nAfter baiting one of the containers from behind the barrier, the experimenter closed\nboth of the containers, removed the barrier, and proceeded to show the bird the contents of\neach container, one at a time. To do so, the experimenter opened the lid of one of the\ncontainers for three seconds (or until the bird looked at the open container), closed the lid,\nand then proceeded to do the same for the other container. The location (left or right) of the\ncontainer that was opened first was counterbalanced across trials. After this presentation\nthe experimenter pushed the tray flush against the cage. The experimenter immediately left\nthe experimental room to allow the bird to make a choice in private. Birds were allowed to\nmake a single choice, which was defined by the bird making contact with either one of the\ncontainers. If the bird chose the rewarded container it was allowed to obtain the seed before\nthe tray was pulled away. If the bird chose the unrewarded container, a 10-second blackout\nensued (experimental room lights extinguished) and the tray was pulled away from the\ncage. After the bird's choice, a 30-second inter-trial interval was instituted. Once a bird was\nreliably making a choice within 30 seconds or less, and this choice was correct during\nseven of the eight trials for 5 consecutive days, the bird was presented with the testing\nsessions.\nii) Testing. Testing was conducted over 20 days (with sessions conducted Monday\nthrough Friday each week) with one session per day consisting of eight trials: six training\ntrials and two test trials. The procedures for the six training trials were exactly as described\nabove. The two test trials occurred randomly between trials two through seven (trials one\nand eight were always training trials), but were never presented consecutively. One test\ntrial was conducted by the familiar experimenter, and the other test trial was conducted by\nthe novel experimenter. For each test trial, the experimenter baited one container as during\ntraining. However, once the barrier was removed the experimenter gestured to the baited\ncontainer, which now had the swivel lid closed, by looking (orienting his head and eyes\ntowards the container), pointing (extending his ipsilateral arm towards container), and\ntouching (making contact with container using his finger tip). This gesture was held for 3\nseconds or until the bird attended to the gesture by tilting its head in each direction to view\nthe situation with each eye. If the bird correctly chose the rewarded container, defined as\nremoving the swivel lid, it was allowed to retrieve the seed. However, if it chose the\nunrewarded container the tray was pulled away. Unlike the training trials, blackout periods\nwere not presented for incorrect choices during testing to reduce the potential for\nassociative learning.\nDuring Phase 2 the birds were challenged to use the knowledge states of two\nexperimenters simultaneously in order to find the reward. To accomplish this, we needed to\nensure that the birds were able to reliably use the gesture; therefore, during Phase 2 all of\nthe birds from Phase 1 were now explicitly trained to use the gesture. A new person was\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nused as the novel experimenter during Phase 2.\ni) Training. Birds were trained in three stages. During stage one, the training\nprocedures were the same as those of testing during Phase 1 with the exception that once\nthe barrier was removed the experimenter baited one of the containers in full view of the\nbird. The experimenter then gestured to the open and baited container for 3 seconds before\nthe bird was allowed to make a choice. Once a bird made a correct choice during seven of\nthe eight trials for 2 consecutive days, the bird was presented with stage two.\nStage two was identical to stage one with the exception that after the container was\nbaited the experimenter closed both containers before gesturing to the baited container.\nOnce a bird made a correct choice during seven of the eight trials for 2 consecutive days,\nthe bird was presented with stage three.\nDuring stage three the visual barrier was erected and from behind this barrier the\nexperimenter repositioned the containers so that they were vertically aligned on the tray (at\nthis point neither of the containers were baited; see Figure 2). This alignment prevented the\nbirds from being able to use the experimenter's arm position during the baiting process as a\nreliable cue for the position of the baited container (see below). Once the containers were\naligned, the barrier was removed and the experimenter positioned a cardboard stand (28.5\ncm x 45 cm) in front of the tray. This stand allowed the experimenter to bait one of the two\ncontainers without the bird seeing which of the containers was baited. After the container\nwas baited, the experimenter moved both containers back to their lateral positions, removed\nthe cardboard stand, and proceeded to gesture to the baited container (the location of the\nbaited container now unknown to the bird). The tray was placed flush against the cage and\nthe experimenter left the room permitting the bird to make a choice in private. The bird was\nallowed to retrieve the seed after making a correct choice, whereas an incorrect choice was\nfollowed by a 10-second blackout period. Once a bird was reliably making a choice within\n30 seconds or less, and this choice was correct during seven of the eight trials for 5\nconsecutive days, the bird was presented with the testing sessions.\nii) Testing. Testing was conducted over 16 days (with sessions conducted Monday\nthrough Friday each week) with one session per day consisting of eight trials: six stage-\nthree training trials and two test trials. The procedures for the six training trials were\nexactly as described above for stage three. The two test trials occurred randomly between\ntrials two through seven (trials one and eight were always training trials), but were never\npresented consecutively. There were two testing conditions: the Uninformed Gesture\ncondition and the Gesture Conflict condition. One test trial of each condition was\nadministered during a daily session. Testing involved two knowledge states: the \"Informed\nExperimenter,\" during which the experimenter baited the container and therefore was\ninformed as to the location of the reward, and the \"Uninformed Experimenter,\" during\nwhich the experimenter was not involved in the baiting process and therefore uninformed\nof the location of the reward. The familiar and novel experimenters performed both roles\nequally often\u00adi.e., the familiar experimenter acted as the Informed Experimenter and the\nUninformed Experimenter, and the novel experimenter also acted as the Informed\nExperimenter and the Uniformed Experimenter. Thus, the birds could not use the identity\nof the person to reliably find the food.\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nFigure 2. Stage 3 training during Phase 2\nNotes: 1) Both containers placed centrally on the tray outside the cage. 2) A cardboard stand\nwas introduced to occlude bird's view of containers. 3) The containers were returned to the\nlateral positions. 4) The cardboard stand was removed and the containers were placed in their\nfinal locations prior to making the gesture.\nDuring the Uninformed Gesture condition, the Informed Experimenter presented the\ntrial as in stage three, except after removing the cardboard stand the Informed Experimenter\nleft the experimental room and was replaced by the Uninformed Experimenter. Prior to this\npoint, the Uninformed Experimenter was in an adjacent room. The Uninformed\nExperimenter gestured to a predetermined container; during half of the trials this container\nwas the rewarded one and during half of the trials it was the unrewarded one. The gesture\nwas held for 3 seconds after which the tray was pushed flush against the cage and the\nexperimenter left the room, allowing the bird to make a choice in private. This condition\nallowed us to examine whether the birds would use the gesture information even when it\nwas uninformative, in which case the birds should follow the gesture of the Uninformed\nExperimenter, or whether the birds would refrain from using the uninformative gesture and\neither choose randomly between the two containers or adopt a side preference.\nDuring the Gesture Conflict condition, the Informed Experimenter prepared the trial\nas in stage three, except once the cardboard stand was removed the Uninformed\nExperimenter also entered the enclosure. As in the Uninformed Gesture condition, the\nUninformed Experimenter was in an adjacent room during the baiting process. Both\nexperimenters proceeded to gesture (simultaneously) to a predetermined container. The\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nInformed Experimenter gestured to the rewarded container whereas the Uninformed\nExperimenter gestured to the unrewarded container. The gesture was held for 3 seconds,\nafter which the tray was pushed flush against the cage and both experimenters left the\nroom, allowing the bird to make a choice in private. In order to choose correctly, the bird\nhad to use some aspect of the experimenters' knowledge or behavioral states. Conversely,\nchoosing equally between the two experimenters would indicate that an associative process\nguided the birds' choices, and that the associative learning gained from the training trials\nsupersedes any potential preference for an experimenter based on familiarity.\nFor both test conditions, if a bird chose the rewarded container it was allowed to\nrecover the seed prior to the tray being pulled away, whereas if the unrewarded container\nwas chosen the tray was pulled away (but no blackout period was administered) and a 30-\nsecond inter-trial interval ensued.\nStatistical analysis\nFor all analyses alpha was set at 0.05. Choice accuracy was analyzed using repeated\nmeasures ANOVAs with Experimenter and Testing Blocks as variables. Although the\ntesting trials were conducted consecutively, for the purpose of analyses we divided them\ninto two equal blocks to examine any learning effects. One-sample t-tests were used to\ncompare the choice accuracy against chance (0.50).\nResults\nEight birds progressed to testing after an average of 27 training days.

This finding seems to be at odds\nwith those recently reported by Tornick et al. (2011). The nutcrackers in this previous study\nlearned to use gestural cues to locate a food reward quickly and effectively, whereas the\nmajority of our birds were unable to learn to use the human-based gesture despite being\nexplicitly trained to follow the gesture through additional training trials and the\nimplementation of correction procedures after incorrect choices.\nSeveral procedural differences were introduced in our study (e.g. combined gesture,\nmultiple experimenters) compared to that of Tornick et al. (2011), which may account for\nsome of the differences in gesture learning. The results of our study do not support the\nlikelihood that the nutcrackers were learning to use the gesture cue through local\nenhancement strategies (Tornick et al., 2011; Schloegl et al., 2008). Tornick et al.\nsuggested that this simpler strategy may have accounted for subjects' superior performance\nwith pointing and touch cues over eye gaze because these cues reduce the distance between\nthe cue and the goal location. However, in our current study, both the point and touch cue\nof our gesture were presented together and offered no distance between the cue and the\ncontainer, yet the nutcrackers struggled to learn to follow the gesture. Thus, even though\nwe increased the physical contact with the rewarded container, arguably increasing local\nenhancement, the nutcrackers were not able to use this local information to improve choice\nbehavior. Alternatively, Mulcahy and Hedge (2012) have suggested that primates (and\npossibly the nutcrackers in the current experiment) struggle in the object choice task\nbecause of their proximity to the choice containers, which interferes with the subject's\nability to attend to the experimenter's cue.\nIt has been proposed that early developmental experience with humans may explain\nthe successful use of human-given gestures in some species (e.g., bats: Hall et al., 2011;\nCanids: Udell and Wynne, 2010; Udell, Dorey, and Wynne, 2010; scrub jays: von Bayern\nand Emery, 2009). This hypothesis might explain the difficulty the nutcrackers had in\nlearning to reliably use the gesture. However, this would not explain the contradictory\nresults of Tornick et al. (2011) and our experiment, as the birds in these studies were wild-\ncaught as adults and experienced similar laboratory environments and experimental\nhistories.\nKnowledge states\nThe birds that did proceed to testing after learning the gesture tended to use the\ngestural information from the Uninformed Experimenter during the Uninformed Gesture\ncondition. This suggests that when the birds did learn the gesture, the use of this gesture\nwas robust and persisted even when it did not provide reliable information as to the\nreward's location. However, when the gestures from the two experimenters provided\nconflicting information as to the location of the rewarded container, overall the birds chose\nthe Informed Experimenter more often than would be expected by chance, showing that\nthey were able to distinguish between the two experimenters.\nThe birds could have made this discrimination by either using the experimenters'\nknowledge states (i.e., informed and uninformed) or behavioral states (i.e., presence and\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nabsence; Povinelli and Vonk, 2003, 2004). The birds' choices did not seem to be driven by\nan associative process during the Gesture Conflict condition, since the birds showed\ndiscrimination despite receiving equivalent reinforcement from both experimenters during\ntraining. Additionally, the birds' performance was better during the first block of testing\n(albeit not significantly) with three of the four birds choosing correctly on the first trial,\nsuggesting that the birds were not using a learned rule to solve the task. Using behavioral\nstates would likely require the learning of such a rule, as by itself the behavioral state is not\nimmediately informative unless linked to a knowledge state (e.g., presence during an event\nleads to an informed knowledge state) and would not explain the first block performance.\nThe birds' behavior was not affected by an experimenter's absence during baiting,\nas shown by their reliance on the gesture during the Uninformed Gesture condition.\nTherefore, it seems unlikely that the birds avoided choices to the Uninformed Experimenter\nduring the Gesture Conflict condition simply due to this experimenter's initial absence\nduring baiting. Instead, the birds used some other aspect of the Informed Experimenter,\neither his presence during baiting, thus facilitating a greater association between that\nexperimenter and the food, or his informed knowledge state, allowing the bird to reason\nthat the experimenter \"knew\" the food's location. At this point, we cannot clearly\ndissociate these two alternative explanations, yet it seems that the information provided by\nthe Informed Experimenter was used most for the birds' choices.\nFlexible cognition?\nTo determine whether corvid social cognition is a flexible ability, we argue that it is\nimportant to challenge corvids in non-ecologically relevant tasks, which is a reason for\nchoosing the object-choice task in the current study. Researchers have expressed concern\nover using tasks that are low in ecological validity (e.g., Tomasello, Call, and Hare, 2003).\nHowever, examining species in both ecologically relevant and non-ecologically relevant\ncontexts can reveal the potential, and equally as important, the limits of a given species'\ncognitive abilities. Furthermore, when used with multiple species, this approach can\nelucidate how the underlying mechanism responsible for the animal's behavior (i.e.,\nassociative and/or cognitive processes) vary in relation to phylogeny, and thus, how\ncognitive abilities may have developed over evolutionary time (see also Vonk and Subiaul,\nOverall, the nutcrackers chose the gesture of the Informed Experimenter despite a\nnumber of components of the task that could be considered non-ecologically relevant.\nAside from explicitly testing the birds outside of a food-caching context, the experiment\nalso required the birds to use the gestures of a distantly-related species. Kaplan (2011)\ndocumented how Australian magpies \"point\" referentially by aligning their body, both\nhorizontally and vertically, toward a predator. Therefore, the important feature of avian\ngestural exchanges may be body orientation, an aspect not manipulated in this experiment.\nConsidering the different forms that the gestures of primates and birds take (e.g., beak\nversus limb pointing), the nutcrackers may have had difficulty recognizing that a referential\ngesture was being presented. This would explain the difficulty the birds experienced during\ntraining with a human gesture. Additionally, combining different task components (e.g.,\ngesture use, multiple experimenters, using knowledge states) likely would have increased\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nthe task's difficulty, an idea proposed by Call and Tomasello (1999), who suggested the\nobject-choice task is difficult in that \"the subject is asked to master both the logistics of the\ntask and to display an understanding of other minds at the same time\" (p. 382).\nObject-choice tasks have also been argued to be a cooperative task (Hare, 2001),\nwhich may be less ecologically relevant and consequently less intuitive for a relatively non-\nsocial species like the Clark's nutcracker. Clary and Kelly (2011) made a similar argument\nwhen describing the different cache protection strategies nutcrackers use compared to\nsocial species. After experiencing cache theft, nutcrackers were found to decrease the\nnumber of caches made over time, the opposite pattern of the more social Western scrub-\njay (Emery et al., 2004), which increased caching behavior after experiencing pilferage.\nThus, the authors suggested that nutcrackers view caching interactions as competitive,\nwhereas social species view them as cooperative. If less social species view social\ninteractions as competitive, this may explain why the majority of the nutcrackers had\ndifficulty consistently following the cooperative communicative gesture during our current\nstudy (see also Hare and Tomasello, 2004; Herrmann and Tomasello, 2006). This could\nexplain the above chance, yet low accuracy performance of the nutcrackers in Phase 1 and\nthe inability of many birds to achieve maximum accuracy in Phase 2.\nConvergent evolution\nSpecifically because the object-choice task is difficult and non-ecologically relevant\nfor corvids (perhaps especially so for less social species), the evidence that corvids can\nsucceed in these tasks is particularly revealing as to the extent of their cognitive\ncapabilities. The results presented here highlight the potential flexibility and complexity\nunderlying nutcracker cognition. If the nutcrackers are capable of making judgments about\nthe mental states of others in this difficult context (although strictly speaking, a behavioral\naccount cannot be excluded\u00adsee Penn and Povinelli, 2007), then it is possible, although\nspeculative, that these birds are using these abilities proficiently in natural situations (e.g.,\nduring caching interactions) and are examples of complex cognition.\nUnlike nutcrackers' ability to interpret human gestures, using knowledge states may\nbe an ecologically relevant skill for corvids and represents a convergence of mental\nabilities with primates, as the circumstances leading to knowledge acquisition are likely\nsimilar (e.g., presence during events leads to informed knowledge states; corvids: Bugnyar,\n2011; primates: Hare et al., 2001) and not necessarily cache dependent. The nutcrackers\nmay have been able to use the experimenter's knowledge state, but were not proficient in\nusing the gesture because the birds could not easily extract the information conveyed due to\nthe divergent forms of avian and human (primate) gestures. Therefore, although it seems\nthat the nutcracker's ability to generalize gestural forms of communication is limited, their\nsocial cognitive processes may be more easily generalized to non-ecologically relevant\n(i.e., non-caching) contexts.\nOur investigation provides an initial step in testing corvids in social cognition tasks\nmore typically utilized with primates. This study indicates that nutcrackers may share with\nchimpanzees the ability to discriminate between experimenters based on whether the\nexperimenter had previously baited a container and possibly evaluate some aspects of the\nknowledge states of other individuals\u00adfurther suggesting that the similarities in behavior\nHuman knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana\nand cognition between corvids and primates represents evidence for convergent evolution.\n"
