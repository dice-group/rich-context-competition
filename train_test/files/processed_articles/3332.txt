Under the\ntraditional model publicly funded researchers submit their\narticles and research reports for free to journals, and the insti-\ntutions which have paid for the research in the first place, and\nemploy the researchers, must purchase it back from commer-\ncial publishers at lofty prices. Members of the public and\nother potential users who are often meant to benefit from this\nresearch are rarely able to afford access despite the fact that\nthe research itself has been largely subsidized by the state\nand the costs of dissemination have been reduced to zero by\nthe new technologies. Hence, the scholarly publishing sys-\ntem itself has become a source of financial pressure as well\nissues came to the fore with the emergence of the so-called\n\"Academic Spring\" featuring boycotts of journals published\nthe leading science publisher, Elsevier, after the company\nhad supported legislative efforts in the United States to ban\nopen access mandates.\nPolicymakers and even major commercial publishers have\nannounced their readiness to embrace some form of transition\nto open access. National governments in the United Kingdom\nand the United States have announced or established regula-\ntory regimes requiring researchers with public support to\nmake their peer reviewed articles available for free online.\nOne option is the so-called \"Gold\" route to open access (Gold\nOA), which involves the publication of journals providing\nimmediate free content on line. In this case, the costs of pub-\nlication are either subsidized by third parties, or covered by\nauthor publication charges (APCs) levied on researchers or\ntheir funding institutions. Another approach is the \"Green\"\nroute (Green OA) in which authors deposit preprint versions\nof their articles into freely accessible digital archives after\nthey have been published in traditional subscription-funded\njournals. Both varieties of OA have steadily grown over the\nlast decade. In fact, it is estimated that nearly 17% of articles\nindexed in ISI's Web of Knowledge index are now published\nin Gold OA journals (Laakso & Bjork, 2012). The Directory\nof Open Access Journals (DOAJ) lists almost 7,000 journals\nthat are now published for free online. The worldwide propor-\ntion of peer reviewed research available through Green OA--\ndeposited by authors in open archives--is already estimated\nat 25% and is likely to grow stronger as self-archiving man-\ndates become more prevalent (Gargouri et al., 2012).\n1York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nRichard Wellen, Faculty of Education, Department of Social Science, York\nEmail: rwellen@yorku.ca\nOpen Access, Megajournals, and MOOCs:\nOn the Political Economy of Academic\nUnbundling\nRichard Wellen1\n Keywords\nopen access, MOOCs, megajournals, academic productivity, scholarly publishing\n2 SAGE Open\nThis article examines the often ambiguous prospects and\nimplications of open access alternatives, not only in aca-\ndemic publishing but also in the more controversial case of\nmassive open online courses known as Massive Online Open\nCourses (MOOCs). My goal is to examine the logic and con-\nsequences of recent support for open content by governments\nand policy communities and to connect this to the unbun-\ndling of academic functions that the new digital academic\ncommons allows. Unbundling is central to new open content\nformats because, as information becomes more portable and\neasier to copy and share, new, potentially \"disruptive\" ways\nare created for discovering, managing, using, and aggregat-\ning academic material and educational resources. According\nto the theory of disruptive innovation, these new kinds of\nservices can bring about structural changes to markets and\nindustries by initially serving a previously underrecognized\nor unconventional user need before scaling up to competing\nwith mainstream providers (Christensen & Raynor, 2003). A\nfrequently cited example is the demise of Encyclopedia\nBrittanica by the rise of Internet-enabled editing used by\nWikipedia. Often disruption is driven by technologies that\nallow important parts of a task to be modularized and per-\nformed more efficiently or conveniently by new agents or\nintermediaries empowered by that technology (Christensen\n& Eyring, 2011). One question that emerges in our context is\nwhether open access megajournals and MOOCs can be cat-\negorized as disruptive innovations.1 For example, as access\nto scholarly content becomes less restricted and more modu-\nlarized, responsibility for filtering that content can be\nassigned to any number of agents, or even crowdsourced by\ninformally organized groups of peers after publication. After\nsurveying the political economy of open access I examine\nhow the rise of post-publication reviewing and academic\nsocial networking may challenge traditional roles and func-\ntions performed by publishers, libraries, and other informa-\ntion intermediaries. MOOCs are an equally disruptive case\nof unbundling. In one sense, online courses simply allow\nhigher education institutions to save money by outsourcing\nteaching work through the use of technologies that make\nteaching content portable. More importantly, however,\nMOOCs are part of a larger socioeconomic shift that would\ndiversify the supply chain of higher education, transferring\nmore academic functions to independent educational ser-\nvices that are offered on a freelancing basis.\nIt can be argued that both open access scholarship and\nMOOCs offer the laudable goal of realizing the full social,\neconomic, and scientific potential of free sharing among\npotential users of knowledge in a digital age. But in what\nfollows, I argue that while these forms of open content lib-\neralize the exchange and circulation of knowledge they\nalso create a new research and education architecture\ndesigned to privatize the means of academic production\naccess and academic unbundling signal the introduction of\nnew forms of academic stratification and competition as\nwell as controversial new political and economic instru-\nments for the external governance of the academic sphere.\nThe Journal, the Market, and the\nAcademic Commons\nIt is often acknowledged that the value of knowledge and\nideas is best realized when they are shared (Hess & Ostrom,\n2007). In this connection, knowledge is commonly called a\npublic good, which refers to its qualities of being nonrival-\nrous and nonexcludable (Tilak, 2008). Knowledge is nonri-\nvalrous in the sense that one person's use of it does not\ndiminish the amount available for others to use. In fact, shar-\ning ideas actually tends to improve them by promoting criti-\ncism and revision as well as allowing them to circulate\namong complementary users. Ideas are also nonexcludable\nin the sense that at least some of their value is lost by limiting\ntheir supply through rationing or by setting restrictions on\nsomeone else's use of them. Any measure that makes an idea\nharder to reuse destroys some of its potential value. Due to\nthese public good characteristics of knowledge, it is efficient\nfor society to create and mandate a sphere--which we can\ncall an academic commons--within which knowledge is\navailable for collective consumption and reciprocal use\namong competent users. Indeed, providing subsidies and\nmarket protection for basic research is important for social\nand economic well-being. As a result, even neoliberal gov-\nernments fiercely committed to the use of market mecha-\nnisms typically ensure that the sphere of curiosity-based\nknowledge creation is largely structured as a commons where\nthe creation and use of ideas is not constrained by barriers of\nprice and permission.\nThe exchange of ideas through scholarly journals is an\nimportant practice sustaining such a commons. Authors will-\ningly forego royalties for their contributions to the commons\nbecause they receive compensation in the form of recognition\nfor the impact they have made. This eventually yields tangi-\nble benefits by helping academics get hired by an institution\ndedicated to knowledge creation and dissemination. Of\ncourse, journals themselves have long been provided through\nmarket-based production rather than through exchanges in\nthe gift economy. That is because print journals themselves,\nunlike the ideas they contain, require the expenditure of\nscarce resources for each unit produced and distributed. The\nincentive for providers to produce those texts and to invest in\nrigorous quality control would be removed if access to them\nwas not rationed by price and if intellectual property rights\ncould not be used to make those texts artificially scarce\n(Courant, 2008). So while ideas are public goods, scholarly\njournals are not. In this case, the tension between the market\nand the academic commons is resolved by research libraries\nwhich have been established with public support to ensure\nthat research texts can be purchased by academic institutions\nand then shared among members of those institutions.\nTherefore, while the production and distribution of research\ntexts is in large measure a commercial enterprise, the fact that\nthe research library serves as a market proxy for academic\ncommunities means that those texts need not be rationed by\nprice among those end users (Lyman, 1999).\nOf course, this harmonious relationship between the com-\nmons and the market is not perfect. The system of market\nprovision means that many other potential end users of those\ntexts are excluded and many institutions cannot afford to buy\nthose texts, or must sacrifice other important goals to do so.\nWhat is compelling about the digital environment is that it\nremoves important obstacles for the free sharing and open\naccess provision of scholarly texts by eliminating the mar-\nginal costs of publishing. Open access advocates therefore\nargue that the scope of the text sharing activities in the aca-\ndemic commons no longer needs to be limited by barriers of\nprice and permission (Suber, 2012). Of course, open access-\ndoes not eliminate the costs of publishing activities such as\nmanaging peer review and marketing which, in the absence\nof artificial scarcity, must be supported by other potentially\ncontroversial means such as subsidy, author-side payments\nor even volunteer effort. The research community and its\nstakeholders may also believe that open content implies less\neffective quality filtering.\nIndeed, academics are accustomed to dissemination lying\nwithin the control of a journal which has proven itself to the\ncommunity as a credible filter of content and certifier of aca-\ndemic achievement. It is perhaps not surprising that recent\nsurveys show that members of the academic community\nembrace open access and the demise of artificial scarcity as\nan ideal, but are concerned that such developments might\njeopardize the system of peer review (Taylor and Francis\nThus, the subscription business model that remains domi-\nnant today rests upon a highly valued partnership of publish-\ners with the academic commons (Wellen, 2004). Moreover,\nat the heart of the current scholarly communications system\nis a business model that has evolved over many decades in\nresponse to the idiosyncratic nature of the academic publish-\ning market. Academic journals typically have small audi-\nences and a weak capacity to attract advertising, which\nmakes them quite different from other types of commercial\ninformation products like trade books and magazines. But\nthis disadvantage is offset by the fact that journal publishers\ndo not have to support academic authors and reviewers who,\ninstead, are paid by higher education institutions (HEIs)--\nand ultimately the public purse--to participate in an intel-\nlectual commons in which they are expected to contribute\nout of professional duty. Furthermore, academic readers\nhave a strong preference to have their libraries provide access\nto everything in their fields of inquiry. In this sense, the\ndemand for scholarly journals tends to be highly inelastic as\neach title cannot be easily substituted for another. Moreover,\nbecause many academic readers have unpriced access\nthrough their research libraries, they have little reason to\nconcern themselves with whether the price of a given journal\nreflects its value (Bergstrom, 2001). In effect, the end user\n(the academic researcher) is relatively insulated from the\nmarket. In addition, the value of scholarly journals is hard to\nobserve except by small groups of experts working within\nnarrow specialties. For all these reasons, market forces argu-\nably cannot exert a very strong downward pressure on prices.\nIt is not surprising, then, that major academic journal pub-\nlishers today such as Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley & Sons\nmanage to obtain extremely high profit margins of between\ntional subscriptions to research libraries. Some have sug-\ngested that market forces might bring prices down if\nacademic readers were to buy access to articles on a pay-per-\nview basis (Bergstrom, 2010), but such a model would con-\nflict with the collegial ethos and the logic of collective\nprovision which is a hallmark of the academic commons. If\nfaculty members and students were expected to apply for\njournal or article vouchers on an individual basis this would\nresult in administrative inefficiencies, managerial interfer-\nence with academic decision making and possible competi-\ntion among academic disciplines.\nThe commercial publishing industry owes its strength and\nresilience to the strategies developed in response to the mas-\nsive expansion in the rate of research output since the late\n1950s. During most of this period, academic journal output\nhas tracked the massive growth in national research budgets\nMabe, 2003). Despite this growing market, publishers have\nhad to focus their business strategies around product differen-\ntiation rather than market expansion for individual titles. This\nis partly due to the fact that research expansion has taken\nplace through the specialization of academic subfields, each\nrequiring its own journals. The recognized journals in each\nfield acquire the status of \"must have\" titles, thereby creating\ninelastic demand that augments the market power of the pub-\nlisher (McGuigan & Russell, 2008). Another equally impor-\ntant type of product differentiation is that between high and\nlow prestige journals. To understand this, we have to recall\nthat the journal market is a unique kind of \"two-sided\" market\n(McCabe & Snyder, 2007) in which prestige is the key cur-\nrency. In any two-sided market, the commercial fortunes and\nopportunities for platform providers (publishers) depend\nupon finding strategies for serving the needs of interdepen-\ndent users. The job of the academic journal platform is to cre-\nate \"network effects,\" connecting readers who demand trusted\nquality filters with authors who demand impact or attention\nindicator of a journal is its prestige, which is acquired through\nselectivity and exclusion, each journal tries to boost or retain\nits market power by attracting more submissions from impact-\nhungry authors while limiting the final volume of published\ncontent (Edlin & Rubinfeld, 2004). One strategy that publish-\ners have adopted in response to the inherent limits of\ntitle-specific content expansion is the acquisition of estab-\nlished independent journals (McGuigan & Russell, 2008).\n4 SAGE Open\nIndustry-wide profitability and concentration has perhaps\nbeen boosted most by tying the marketing of new journals to\nthe network effects already enjoyed by clusters of established\njournals. To accomplish this, the major academic publishers\nhave developed multiyear licensing arrangements called \"Big\nDeals\" that bundle together high and low impact journals into\nsingle packages which are sold in bulk form to research librar-\nies (Frazier, 2001). Bundling of this type makes it easier for\npublishers to create a captive market for newer (lower tier)\njournals that otherwise would have to compete on an even\nplaying field with new journals offered by smaller publishers.\nTo achieve this, established commercial publishers can lever-\nage their \"reputational capital\" that is already attached to their\ncan also spread their fixed investments in scalable value-\nadded services such as article retrieval systems across their\ndifferent tiers of journals (McCabe & Snyder, 2005).\nFollowing these strategies creates significant entry barriers\nfor would-be publishers lacking either established relation-\nships with libraries or preexisting distribution arrangements\nThe concentration of market power in the academic jour-\nnal industry is almost certainly due to the Big Deal model.\nBundle pricing virtually guarantees that library acquisitions\nbudgets are tied up by established publishers whose new\ntitles always have an advantage over those offered by smaller\npublishers who cannot discount individual titles through\naggregate pricing (Bergstrom 2010; Edlin & Rubinfeld,\n2004). This advantage is further reinforced by the fact that so\nmany of the journals published by the large firms have a\nhighly valued digitized back catalogue to which institutions\ncan gain access only by continuing to subscribe. Moreover,\nthese bundles are negotiated under nondisclosure agree-\nments, which reinforces the tendency to oligopolistic pricing\n(Van Noorden, 2013). Of course, the economics of zero mar-\nginal cost dissemination also allows publishers to add new\njournals to the bulk electronic collections sold to each addi-\ntional customer, ensuring that small and large research librar-\nies alike can subscribe to virtually all of the titles provided in\nDeal packages are typically priced according to a usage\nbased formula scaled to each institution (Walkiers, 2008).\nThe effect of this arrangement is to spread the burden of pay-\ning for a system-wide standard of access among all institu-\ntions. This is how publishers have been able to adopt an\naccess-friendly approach without embracing open access\nThe dominant academic publishing model described\nabove is hardly a print-era relic; rather, it is strongly sup-\nported by the very economics of digital information that is\nused to justify open access. For example, the contemporary\npublishing infrastructure is built around an array of digitally\nenabled services such as indexing, retrieval, and reference\nmanagement, which are complements to the core business of\ncontent provision. Libraries in particular are being disrupted\nby these technologies (Lewis, 2004). Indeed, the fact that\npublishers now provide much of the software, technology,\nresearch tools, and metadata services shows that they are tak-\ning over many of the functions of libraries themselves, bring-\ning economies of scale by avoiding duplication of services\nassumed that the Big Deal is at least partly responsible for\nthe fact that academic researchers increased the number of\nTenopir, 2009).2 This coincides with the period of the growth\nof the commercial publishing sector and can be taken to indi-\ncate the synergy between digital content delivery and Big\nDeal packages. Moreover, efficiencies related to digitization\nare evident in the vast productivity differences between the\nmarket for journals--which are predominantly digital--and\nbooks, which are still mostly printed. In the 25 years ending\nin 2011, member institutions of the Association of Research\nBy comparison, the same libraries paid 90% more for only\nand the Internet have turned the scholarly journal industry\ninto what Anderson (2006) has termed a \"long tail\" market\nwhereby scalable distribution systems have supported the\nmassive expansion in the number of small, specialized out-\nlets for scholarship.\nDefining and Contesting the Open\nAccess Alternative\nCommercial publishers have become the favored intermedi-\naries in scholarly communication on the strength of a dis-\nsemination model that has made them successful partners to\nthe academic commons. Nevertheless, pressure to promote\nopen access alternatives has never been stronger (The\nEconomist, 2013). For the past decade, the demand for\nchange has come from advocates within the academic com-\nmunity, as well as activists and innovators within the schol-\narly communication profession (Wellen, 2004). While many\nadvocates have emphasized openness as a principle implied\nby the vocation of science and scholarship, it is evident that\nreal change is being driven by a consensus about the impor-\ntance of openness for the productivity and progress of sci-\nence. There is now near unanimity among national research\ngranting councils--and the politicians that oversee them--\nthat OA can help ensure the maximum economic and social\nimpact for publicly funded scientific research. As of April\n2013, all publicly funded research output published in schol-\narly journals by U.K. authors came to be covered by enforce-\nable open access mandates. This policy was inspired by the\ngovernment-commissioned Finch report which concluded\nthat open access will bring \"social and economic benefits\"\nby improving the flow of knowledge not only within but also\nEurope has declared that open access would \"have huge\nvalue for the research community and will offer significant\nsocial and economic benefits to potential users in industry,\ncharitable and public sectors, to individual professionals, and\nto the general public\" (Science Europe, 2013, p. 3). Finally,\nin early 2013, the U.S. White House Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy (OSTP; 2013) issued a memo directing\nagencies to ensure open access to publications resulting from\nfederal funds.\nNotably, the Finch report and the Obama administration's\nOSTP memo emphasized the importance of ensuring that\ncontent is not only free but also available for reuse with mini-\nmal restriction. The idea is that if articles are published under\nopen licenses this would further contribute to research pro-\nductivity by facilitating text-mining and better research dis-\ncovery methods. The Finch report took special pains to\nemphasize the advantages of Gold OA publishing, including\nits cost advantages over subscription publishing. Indeed, it\nhas been estimated that the average cost of a peer reviewed\narticle in open access journals could be as low as $400 to\ners earn under the current subscription model (Finch, 2012;\napparent momentum of open access policy even the leading\ncommercial publishers have begun to include open access as\na core part of their strategic vision. Nearly all of the major\nacademic publishers have also converted many of their toll\naccess titles to \"hybrid\" journals allowing authors to elect to\npay an optional publication fee--often over $3,000--to\nenable free online access to those without a subscription.\nThe U.K. OA strategy ultimately implemented by the\nResearch Councils UK (RCUK) places a significant empha-\nsis on both Gold and Green OA, despite the initial controver-\nsial priority given to Gold. Block funding has been allocated\nto a special fund at each institution which can be used to pay\nAPC's for Gold OA. Authors also have the option to publish\nin a subscription-funded journal so long as the journal allows\nGreen OA, in which case authors would be required to\ndeposit a refereed preprint version of their article in an open\naccess repository typically with an embargo period of 6 to 24\nmonths after publication. Tension between the two models of\nOA dominated the policy formulation process in the United\nKingdom, especially in parliamentary hearings where the\nrecommendations of the Finch commission were met with\ngreat scrutiny. This tension illustrates the possible clash\namong the disparate stakeholder interests that will likely\nshape the future of open access. The Minister of Business,\nInnovation and Skills (BIS) argued that Gold OA is superior\nbecause it allows immediate access and typically unrestricted\nreuse, thereby maximizing research impact (Willetts, 2013).\nCriticisms of Gold OA were voiced by a range of stakehold-\ners from OA advocates and activists to the influential Russell\nGroup of research intensive universities. These groups\nargued that if the United Kingdom unilaterally becomes an\nearly adopter of mandatory OApublishing (rather than Green\nself-archiving) then it runs the risk of having to pay APC's\nfor the research output of U.K. authors while still paying for\njournal subscriptions to gain access to the output from the\nrest of the world (The Russell Group, 2013). Many publish-\ners demand higher APCs before they will grant liberal reuse\nrights (under Creative Commons cc-by licenses, for exam-\nple) and this, too, would lead to the United Kingdom paying\nindividually for benefits that are enjoyed by all. Some critics\nof the policy argued that it would be best to allow Gold OA\nto evolve after Green OA becomes widespread so that pub-\nlishers would be constrained to adopt a more affordable ver-\nsion of \"author-pays\" publishing (Houghton, Rasmussen, &\nSwan, 2013). The strongest opponents of Gold OA worry\nthat any approach to allocating publication support may\nintroduce rationing of funds and controversial and non-colle-\ngial determinations about which scholarly contributions and\ndisciplines would or should be eligible for support.\nGreen OA has its shortcomings as well, primarily because\nit is parasitical upon the subscription model rather than an\nalternative to it. For this reason, publishers often claim they\nneed an embargo period of up to 36 months after publication\nto guard against subscription cancellations. Moreover, such\npublishers are usually not prepared to allow authors to\ndeposit the final copy of record. The policymaking process\nactive lobbying to ensure that embargo periods are set long\nenough to protect their highly profitable subscription model.\nIn the case of the RCUK policy, the preferred embargo for\nscience, technical, engineering, and medicine (STEM) mate-\nrial was been set at 6 months and 12 months for social sci-\nence and humanities (SSH) research, but where money to\npay APCs is not available publishers are permitted to double\nthe embargo period. Both the Association of American\nPublishers and Elsevier supported the Obama administra-\ntion's open access memo of early 2013 but only, it seems,\nafter the government promised that it would allow publishers\nto apply for lengthened embargo periods for certain disci-\nplines (Association of American Publishers, 2013; Wise,\n2013). In the United Kingdom, some publishers have actu-\nally lengthened their embargo periods since the new RCUK\npolicy came into effect (Poynder, 2013). There is a growing\nfear that the new policy will encourage hybrid publishing so\nthat journals can offer immediate open access options\nto authors for a fee while still maintaining regular subscrip-\ntion revenue streams. To avoid accusations of \"double dip-\nping,\" some publishers have agreed to waive APCs for\nresearchers who work for institutions that subscribe to their\npublishers like Public Library of Science (PLoS) have\nwarned that by making subscriptions and APCs interchange-\nable in this way the dominant publishers can perpetuate non-\ntransparent bundle pricing which is the hallmark of their\nmony to the U.K. parliamentary hearings, PLoS complained\nthat established subscription based publishers were given\ngreater influence over the hearings than firms and organiza-\ntions already specializing in open access (Neylon, 2013).\n6 SAGE Open\nFinally, it is important to recognize that support for open\naccess often breaks down along disciplinary lines. In STEM\nfields, communication of research findings is much more\ntime-sensitive than in SSH fields which means that even\nshort Green OA embargo periods may not prompt subscrip-\ntion cancellations. By contrast, articles in SSH journals have\na longer half-life, so that delayed access may be a tolerable\ntrade-off for canceling subscriptions. Gold OA has received\nan especially cool reception in SSH fields as it requires pay-\nments made from research grants which are less common\namong SSH researchers. It is therefore no surprise that so\nmany of the flagship Gold OA publishers are concentrated in\nthe STEM fields, while many publishers and scholarly asso-\nciations in the SSH fields view both forms of OA as a poten-\ntial threat. In the 2013 U.K. parliamentary hearings, some\npublishers urged caution about adopting open access for SSH\nfields, citing not only the lower funding available for APCs\nin such disciplines but also their limited economic impact\n(SAGE Publications, 2013). Some SSH academic associa-\ntions see open access as a threat to academic freedom in view\nof the fact that authors in heterodox fields or niche areas may\nbe less able to pay for publication (Political Studies\nAssociation of the UK, 2013). The SSH community is less\nconcerned about boosting research productivity than it is\nabout avoiding a pattern of publishing reform in which the\nmarket would dictate scholarly priorities and resources\nwould be managed in a way that upsets the level playing field\nbetween more and less affluent disciplines. In this sense, the\nreform of research communication has become closely tied\nto familiar contests around the role of markets and impact\nagendas in academic governance.\nConsequences of Unbundling and\n\"Disruption\" in the Open Access\nEcosystem\nIn spite of the contested nature of open access, there are good\nreasons to concede its \"inevitability\" (Lewis, 2012), and it is\ntherefore important to anticipate changes to the role of jour-\nnals in a transformed scholarly communications system. Two\nquestions emerge in particular. First, will OA publishing\nachieve cost savings or otherwise bring a disruptive chal-\nlenge to the market power of publishers, and, if so, how?\nSecondly, will free access accelerate the \"disruption\" of the\njournal itself which will now have to compete with new plat-\nforms such as academic social networks and other intermedi-\naries that can perform quality control, filtering, and content\nIn terms of the first question of market power, we have\nseen that governments in both the United Kingdom and\nUnited States have been responsive to many of the concerns\nof academic publishers regarding the impact of the new regu-\nlatory regime. Indeed, even if Gold OAwere to become more\nprevalent publishers may try to retain the lucrative system of\nfixed pricing arrangements with institutions. Of course,\nmany observers have argued that open access publishing\nwould bring more transparent pricing and competition as this\nsystem allows authors to be more discriminating about where\nto publish than libraries can be in their decisions of which\njournals to purchase (Bergstrom & Bergstrom, 2004; Carroll,\nto doubt whether Gold OA would bring down costs as\nexpected. Clearly, Gold OA would not by itself diminish the\nmutually reinforcing incentives of both publishers and\nauthors to engage in the prestige-driven publishing behavior\nthat currently drives prices and profit margins up (Brembs &\nMunaf\u00f2, 2013). To address this problem, the RCUK has\nissued policy guidance asking institutions to ensure that\ndecisions about where their authors publish are price sensi-\ntive (RCUK, 2013). On the other hand, a recent industry\nstudy argues that:\nMoving to OA does not change the chief motivation of the\nauthor, i.e., to be published in the highest status journal possible.\nResearchers rely on journal titles to provide an external measure\nof the quality of their research. Established journals provide\nprestige and validation for a researcher and both are key to\nfurthering career prospects and securing funding. (HSBC, 2013)\nHence, authors and HEIs remain involved in a deeply\nrooted competition for impact and prestige which may cause\nprice inelasticity to be carried over into the author-pays mar-\nket (Bergstrom, 2010). Moreover, it has been argued that\nmany of the structures of academic life encourage a research\nproductivity arms race which has resulted in opportunistic\npublishing behavior and an expensive increase in the ratio of\npublished articles (and filtering activities) to ideas or find-\nings (Baveye, 2010). The fact that review and promotion\ncommittees include members from different specialties--or\nfrom management--may encourage an emphasis on count-\ning publications rather than evaluating their quality.\nFurthermore, increasingly intense competition for good aca-\ndemic employment means that fledgling researchers need to\nscore as many publication points as possible. The Finch\n(2012) report candidly anticipates that while attempts to\nration APC funds might constrain publication overkill, they\nalso would be controversial.\nThe question of OA's possibly disruptive impact on the\nform of academic publishing cannot be separated from the\nquestion of cost and efficiency. Some have suggested that\nthe combination of free content and ubiquitous networking\nmeans that the functions associated with research sharing no\nlonger need to be tightly coupled. Earl (2008) argues that\ninformation abundance could allow research filtering and\ndissemination to be produced and paid for separately, and\nsuch unbundling might improve both the efficiency and qual-\nsuggests that OA journals could contribute to beneficial pub-\nlishing reform by charging fees at the point of submission\nrather than upon the final publication of accepted articles.\nHis reasoning is that publication costs are based on the num-\nber of submissions and if each instance of peer review was\npriced, independent of whether it led to acceptance or rejec-\ntion, it would remove the subsidy that some authors effec-\ntively pay to others who make \"unrealistic submissions.\"\nPriem and Hemminger (2012) argue that the Internet allows\nediting, peer review, and dissemination to be unbundled so\nthese functions can be delivered by different providers and\npriced separately. They argue that peer review services--and\npeer reviewers themselves--could compete for monetary\nrewards or social/professional recognition by selling ratings\nor \"stamps.\" Such competition would create a self-regulating\nmarket so that the price at which outsourced review services\nwould be able to sell stamps would be dependent directly on\ntheir trusted track record.\nThere are already a number of examples of independent\ncommercial providers of unbundled publishing services. For\nexample, a new company called Rubriq currently offers a\nstandalone peer review service which it sells to authors for\nvery quick review and a standardized numerical scorecard\nfor their submitted work. The resulting \"R-score\" can be\nused to provide advice on publication venues and can pro-\nvide subscribing journals with an \"initial filter\" that can help\neconomize on downstream editorial and reviewing costs\n(Collier, 2013). This model of unbundled prepublication fil-\ntering may limit the duplication of filtering instances by pro-\nviding \"portable\" reviews that can accompany subsequent\nsubmissions (Collier, 2013). As a referral service between\nauthors and journals Rubriq carries with it a strong incentive\nfor disclosure and sharing of information, overcoming some\nof the nontransparency of traditional peer review. Outsourced\npeer review--or the commodification of peer review--\nwould not necessarily add another layer of cost to the pub-\nlishing process if it offset the price journals currently charged\nfor some of its services. Like a journal, a peer review service\nis a multisided market (or networking platform), which has\nto satisfy the interdependent needs of complementary groups\nof users. In this case, however, the user pairs are not authors/\nreaders, as is the case with journals, but rather authors/jour-\nnals. Rubriq's advantage is that it will pay reviewers and pro-\nvide article recommendations to journals for free, and\ntherefore has the potential to link authors to a very large\nnumber of publishing opportunities. However, the model\ncould mean that authors pay twice: once for review and a\nsecond time to publish. This is unlikely to attract authors\nseeking to publish in top tier journals as the latter would not\naccept outsourced reviews nor offer discounted services for\npre-reviewed submissions. The prospect for outsourced peer\nreview to become a full-fledged disruptive innovation faces\nsome obvious limits. For example, Rubriq's services would\nlikely be concentrated in the middle and lower tiers of the\njournal market where the probability of article acceptance is\nhigher and APC's are lower or discounted. Of course if peer\nreview is commodified there might be unintended conse-\nquences flowing from the fact that authors or their funders\nwould have to pay for failure. This could encourage tighter\nrationing of APC funding and discouraging risk-averse\nauthors from submitting to the best journals.\nWe do not yet know whether unbundled peer review plat-\nforms will succeed as a business model. But it is clear that a\ncertain kind of unbundling of peer review already lies at the\nheart of the publishing strategy and practices of megajour-\nnals. Open access megajournals, such as PLoS One, Scientific\nReports, Springer Plus, and SAGE Open have begun to cre-\nate an alternative market segment to both high prestige OA\njournals and high priced subscription journals (Van Noorden,\n2013). Megajournals accept articles for publication based on\na simplified threshold while the peer review process is accel-\nerated, screening only for accuracy, validity and scientific\nsoundness rather than novelty or importance. Accordingly,\nmegajournals typically eschew traditional prestige competi-\ntion characteristic of traditional journals. Indeed, most of\nthese titles maintain an extremely wide transdisciplinary\nscope across the sciences, the life sciences, or even humani-\nties and social sciences. PLoS One publishes thousands of\narticles per year and therefore positions itself somewhere\nbetween an archive and a traditional journal. Its publishers\nassume that relevance and importance can best be judged\nafter publication, especially since reliable methods for aggre-\ngating informal assessment are already flourishing in an\nenvironment which includes academic networking services.\nWhen peer review is crowdsourced (or outsourced) articles\ncan more easily be judged on their own merits rather than by\nthe prestige of the journal in which they are published.\nIndeed, one of the key strategies of reform-minded OA pub-\nlishers like PLoS is to introduce \"article level\" metrics to\nreplace journal ranking metrics such as impact factors (PLoS,\n2013). In short, megajournals' selling point is that new net-\nwork-enabled tools for aggregating the decentralized judg-\nments of peers (Mounce, 2013) can justify the use of a\nlow-cost streamlined review process, which also provides\nthe service advantage of rapid turnover time from submis-\nsion to publication.\nOf course, full acceptance of megajournals may depend\non the legitimacy of informal review in the community using\nweb 2.0 communication including crowdsourcing among\npeers as well as nonstandard metrics now known as \"altmet-\nrics\" (Priem, Taraborelli, Groth, & Neylon, 2010). The cur-\nrent academic reward system continues to give authors many\nprofessional and self-interested reasons to send their work to\nthe prestigious journals in their fields. Likewise, there are\nstill pressures on academic adjudicators to use journal pres-\ntige as a convenient proxy for quality (Suber, 2008). On the\nother hand, megajournal supporters can point to the fact that\nprestige-driven behavior is a major factor in driving up the\ncost of academic publishing, and that prestige itself is not\nalways a reliable signaler of quality. It is well known, for\nexample, that the journal hierarchy contributes to the costly\n8 SAGE Open\ncycle of duplicate peer review whereby an author whose\npaper is rejected by a relatively higher ranked journal will\nmake a follow up submission to a lower tier journal. This\nprocess can repeat itself until the article finds its accepted\nposition in the journal hierarchy. The problem with this pat-\ntern stems from the fact that prestige is a positional good.\nHence, when journals compete for prestige, that competition\ndoes not increase the total amount of good papers published\nbut merely changes which rung of the ladder each paper\ncomes to occupy. In fact, journal impact factors and the com-\npetition for journal prestige can actually cause quality to\ndiminish. For example, it has been widely acknowledged\nthat journals competing for rank may be tempted to publish\n\"hot papers\" at the expense of quality or reliability (House of\nCommons Science and Technology Committee, 2011). There\nis growing evidence that prestige-driven competition creates\na publication bias that favors positive results, encourages\nreporting of statistical anomalies and devalues heterodox\nRice, 2013).3 Finally, many good papers are rejected merely\nbecause they fall outside of a given journal's relevance crite-\nria. If many of those articles are eventually published after\nsuccessive rounds of peer review, then it can be argued that\nthe high acceptance rate of megajournals should not be dis-\nparaged as weak filtering but rather praised as cost-efficient\ncompression of the prepublication review phase. Wardle\n(2012) has shown, for example, that ecology papers pub-\nlished in PLoS One are of comparable quality (as measured\nby citations) to those published in many far more selective\nspecialist ecology journals.\nMegajournals, then, represent a potentially innovative\nway for addressing costly review cycles and streamlining\nmultitiered publishing strategies. In particular, they can bring\nin author fees from thousands of papers per year, and there-\nfore may allow publishers to monetize the same volume of\nresearch output as the traditional publishing model but\npotentially at a lower cost (Van Noorden, 2013). Indeed, it\nhas been argued that PLoS One generates revenues to cross-\nsubsidize affiliated flagship publications such as PLoS\nBiology that would not otherwise be sustainable on a stand-\nalone basis (Poynder, 2011a). PLoS One's high volume\nmodel of publication combined with an APC of $1,350 per\narticle can be more profitable than the $2,900 charged by its\nflagship sibling. For its part, Springer is candid about its plan\nto use its megajournal Springer Plus to economize on review-\ning costs by \"cascading\" rejected articles from its flagship\njournals (Ishii, 2012). In view of their potential to become\nhigh volume operations megajournals are likely to seek first\nmover advantage. This appears to be the case with SAGE\nOpen, a multidisciplinary journal in SSH which in early\n2013 reduced its APC to $99 so as to position itself for the\nlong term ascendancy of OA in the less affluent SSH fields\nOne challenge megajournals face if they are expected to\nredefine the market is that their defection from prestige\ncompetition leaves them with a business model that may be\npoorly aligned with reviewer and editor motivations. In the\nacademic \"gift economy,\" reviewers must sacrifice time that\ncould be devoted to their own research, and in exchange,\nthey must be given some opportunity to influence their field,\ngain exposure to the most current cutting edge research or\nlist their service to a prestigious journal on their CVs. But if\nreviewing is reduced to a mere technical judgment of accu-\nracy or if reviewer efforts are spread over too many submis-\nsions a \"tragedy of the reviewer commons\" may result\n(Hochberg, Chase, Gotelli, Hastings, & Naeem, 2009). One\nattempt to address this problem might be the conversion of\nmegajournals to a cooperative-style membership model.\nThis is the inspiration behind the new OA megajournal\nPeerJ, which covers biological and medical science. PeerJ's\nrevenue stream derives from lifetime membership fees (start-\ning at $99) providing for the continuing right to publish a set\nnumber of articles per year, rather than from article process-\ning charges levied for each individual article accepted.\nContributors pay a modest fee for the right to submit, or a\nhigher fee if one elects to wait until acceptance. Each con-\ntributor remains in good standing only if he or she partici-\npates in reviewing or post-publication commentary, which\nensures that all contributors to the journal are rewarded for\ntheir commitment to the reviewer commons. This system of\ncommitment credits incentivizes researchers to volunteer for\nreviewing and academic editing, which presumably helps\nprovide a level of administrative cost savings not available to\nmost competing journals.\nCommercializing the Networked\nAcademic Commons\nOne must be careful not to exaggerate the importance of\nmegajournals. On one hand, they may play an important role\nin overcoming the discontents of a research dissemination\nmodel founded on artificial scarcity. On the other hand, they\nare not likely to fully replace upper tier journals so long as\nacademic communities expect prepublication filtering to sig-\nnal pathbreaking research. Nevertheless, crowdsourcing\ntechnologies are becoming important complements to con-\nventional academic gatekeepers and there is every probabil-\nity new post-publication filters and metrics will allow\ninnovations like megajournals to \"disrupt\" important sectors\nof the journal market (Mounce, 2013). Perhaps the most\nimportant technological factor in the post-scarcity world of\nscholarly communication is the role of software in analyzing\nresearch impact at the level of the article and author rather\nthan the journal. Web 2.0 tools that monitor scholarly reputa-\ntion and analyze usage and reading behavior can reduce the\namount of expensive human input that journals currently use\nfor relevance sorting (Nentwich & K\u00f6nig, 2012). In the\nwords of disruptive innovation theory, this allows megajour-\nnals and academic networks to \"scale upward\" (Christensen,\nHorn, Caldera, & Soares, 2011, p. 23) so that they can rival\ntraditional intermediaries (journals and libraries) rather than\nsimply become low-cost alternatives with a limited market.\nreviewers [once] employed as proxy community assessors\nwill be replaced by the aggregated, collective judgments of\ncommunities themselves.\"\nMendeley is probably one of the most exemplary services\nfor blending the functions of peer to peer academic network-\ning and dissemination in this way. It is a freely accessible\ncloud-based research article manager and bibliographic data-\nbase that gives users convenient access to a personalized\nlibrary of articles from any workstation and also provides\nannotation and bookmarking, as well as the capacity to share\none's library with collaborators. While Mendeley is an orga-\nnizing tool available for free to researchers, it is also a potent\nplatform for aggregating data about the behaviors and inter-\nests of those researchers. It can generate recommendations\nfor articles based on comparisons with the reading interests\nof similar users in its database and can also be used to ana-\nlyze resource usage and measure the research impact and\nproductivity of scholars. Due to the power of its new crowd-\nsourcing tools Mendeley was acquired by Elsevier in early\n2013. Elsevier thereby acquired Mendeley's rich pool of user\ngenerated data which can be used to help it improve and\nenhance its larger array of scholarly information products\nservices and infrastructure (Henning, 2013). Therefore,\nwhile Elsevier faces a decline in its ability to profit from arti-\nficially scarce information, the new tools for making\nresearcher behavior more transparent may help it develop\nprofitable services for managing and integrating all aspects\nof the research process.\nBut these innovations may come at the price of creating\ntensions between the market and the academic commons. For\nexample, as academic social networks make researcher\nbehavior far more transparent to publishers it may also\nencourage the proliferation of greater performance monitor-\ning in a community that prizes its autonomy. As a result, the\nnew system of research communication could involve contro-\nversial changes such as increased academic self-promotion\nand more quantitative approaches to assessment (Nentwich &\nK\u00f6nig, 2012). On the other hand, given the role that academ-\nics play as self-governing producers, publishing giants like\nElsevier may be constrained to \"play nice\" in order to keep\nthe trust of the researcher community (Dobbs, 2013).\nLessons From Another Form of\nUnbundling: MOOCs and Online\nEducation\nThe recent emergence of Massive Open Online Courses or\nMOOCs has introduced another version of \"disruptive\"\nunbundling connected with the academic open content move-\nment. New start-up companies such as Udacity, EDx, and\nCoursera have begun to provide free online access to mass-\nproduced courses taught by leading faculty members at the\nworld's most prestigious universities. In the case of MOOCs,\nstudents do not pay fees to the content provider for basic\nenrolment in the course, nor do they receive credit from the\ncontent-providing institution. Social networking, interactive\nservices, and automated grading or peer assessment are pro-\nvided by the platform provider, as is a nominal certificate for\nthe completion of assignments. MOOCs have become attrac-\ntive because their technology brings modularity to several\ncomponents of higher education content such as lectures and\nrecordable demonstrations to reach mass audiences in a flex-\nible and accessible on-demand format. In the meantime, the\nbrand and market power of the elite institutions which typi-\ncally provide the content is strengthened by unbundling con-\ntent from its local institutional context and making it available\nthrough mass, zero marginal cost distribution. The elite insti-\ntutions do not award credit for students completing these\ncourses and therefore can retain their exclusive status even as\nthey disseminate part of their product for mass consumption.\nAlthough MOOCs may be considered open in the sense of\n\"free to try,\" they are not offered under an open license. Any\nuse of the content or services for academic credit-bearing\npurpose is restricted and requires payment to the MOOC pro-\nIn most cases, MOOCs are used as a flexible educational\nresource by nontraditional learners or individuals satisfying\ntheir personal interest or their need for continuing education\nor skills upgrading. But many theorists and observers of the\nknowledge and information economy have long seen online\neducation as part of an austerity and productivity agenda in\nthe neoliberal reform of higher education (Jessop, 2012;\nNoble, 1998). Sebastian Thrun, one of the leading MOOC\nentrepreneurs, has offered the dramatic prediction that within\n50 years the online transformation of higher education could\nreduce the number of higher education institutions to 10.\nMany lawmakers and political leaders have portrayed\nMOOCs--or online education more generally--as one pos-\nsible way to respond to growing concerns about the so-called\n\"higher education bubble\" within their key middle class con-\nstituencies (Cronin & Horton, 2009). The \"bubble\" is charac-\nterized by the spiraling public and private costs of enrolments,\nincreased student debt, and anxiety over the value of\ncredentials.\nMajor reports by governments and consultants across\nNorth America and major initiatives by private foundations\nsuch as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have strongly\npromoted the use of learning technologies and online educa-\ntion to increase the rates of degree completion and educa-\ntional productivity (Walters, 2012). Meanwhile, proponents\nof the theory of disruptive innovation have helped to con-\nvince policymakers and higher education elites that HEIs\nwill be revolutionized by new online technologies that spread\ninstruction over large numbers of potential learners. This fits\nthe definition of a disruptive technology that would allow\nnew entrants to start at the low end of the higher education\nmarket and scale their business model upward (Christenson\net al., 2011). In this case, the result would be to liberate stu-\ndents and taxpayers from the unitary model of vertically inte-\ngrated HEIs that hire expensive professors whose work\ncombines teaching with research and which assumes that all\nstudents need education to be accompanied by a distinctive\nphysical, in-person environment for self-cultivation. As\nChristensen and Eyring (2011) observed, under this domi-\nnant model, the vast majority of HEIs have inherited the\nDNA of the elite institutions in the sector, locking in the high\noverhead costs of integrating the different higher education\nfunctions. This has meant that the price of the package that\nmany HEIs provide has increased far more than its value for\nsociety and most students. By contrast, a disrupted higher\neducation system would enable new education providers to\nserve students who would be willing to pay less for the \"good\nenough\" education that most students want, one that would\nbe convenient, useful and often available on demand from\nBy distributing more teaching resources as globalized\ncommodities, or as pooled resources among partner institu-\ntions, a disrupted higher education system would feature a\nnew teaching-only mission for many middle and lower tier\ninstitutions. These institutions would place a more direct\nemphasis on vocational relevance as well as access to on-site\nmentoring in a blended teaching model. Unbundling higher\neducation would also make it possible to eliminate the hith-\nerto unavoidable cross-subsidies that support the kind of\n\"unmarketable\" research that disruption theorists say many\nprofessorspursue(Horn&Christensen,2013;TheEconomist,\n2012).4 The new market for academic talent would lower the\nsalary and status of many faculty and give them less auton-\nomy over academic content creation and institutional gover-\nnance. Such an outcome was anticipated in the dystopian\nstudy by David Noble (1998) who argued that online educa-\ntion would commodify higher education and lead to the cre-\nation of \"digital diploma mills.\" Of course, many students\nwould continue to pay a premium for a fully bundled, high\nstatus education offering a selective admission process,\ndirect contact with reputable academic researchers and an\nopportunity to link learning with personal and civic develop-\nment. In this sense the prestige economy of higher education\nwould place a natural limit to disruption as an elite sector\nwould persist alongside of academic streamlining, just as\nflagship scholarly journals likely would not be eliminated by\nmegajournals.\nMOOCs' key market strategy is to exploit their modular-\nity and mass scale, which allows sufficient revenue genera-\ntion even if only a relatively small percentage of students\nbuy premium services, or pay to use the courses for degree\ncredit. With its promise to expand the reach of the best pro-\nfessors, the MOOC industry creates \"winner take all\" mar-\nkets that may reinforce homogeneity of content rather than\nlong tail markets supporting niche curriculum areas (Rivard,\ndesigned for cross-contextual application some have argued\nthat the format itself is optimized for material that is stan-\ndardized, popular, trendy, uncontroversial, and safe\n(Delbanco, 2013). Indeed, it has been acknowledged by\nMOOC advocates that teaching resources that are designed\nto be reusable across contexts can be very expensive to cus-\ntomize for the curriculum of a given institution or academic\ndepartment (Bowen, 2013). For similar reasons, MOOCs are\nfar less able to bring their productivity advantage to more\n\"discursive\" fields of knowledge and to courses where stu-\ndent assessment cannot be automated (Bowen, 2013). In\nlight of these problems, it is not certain that academic quality\ncan be scaled up in the way that disruptive innovation theo-\nrists expect, unless quality is redefined around what MOOCs\ndo well.\nAccording to disruptive innovation theory, one of the\ngreat benefits of academic unbundling is the unleashing of\nmarket forces in the sphere of higher education. Of course\nmany have argued that some of the most important qualities\nof higher education are threatened when it is treated as a mar-\nket commodity (Tilak, 2008). For example, higher education\nresembles what economists call an experience good, since it\npossess qualities that are hard for would-be consumers to\nobserve prior to consumption, which means that the informa-\ntion requirements for efficient market provision cannot nor-\nmally met. Markets also fail to recognize and reward those\n(often intangible) benefits of higher education that cannot be\npriced. Clearly many qualities of higher education would\nbe lost if we eliminated the subsidies and cross-subsidies that\nsupport the many positive externalities that result from its\nconsumption (Tilak, 2008). For example, if market competi-\ntion concentrates research in fewer flagship universities then\nthis could diminish the contributions that non-elite institu-\ntions make to their regional networks and local communities\n(Benkler, 2008). Others have remarked that higher education\nmarkets encourage an academic \"star system,\" which can put\nstrains on the cohesiveness of the academic community and\nundermine the collective purpose needed for good gover-\nnot surprising that MOOCs have become highly controver-\nsial symbols of commodified education, educational stratifi-\ncation, deprofessionalized academic work, and threats to\nacademic autonomy. Faculty groups and committees at some\nelite institutions have voted to refuse to participate in the\ndevelopment of MOOCs (Kolowich, 2013b) and some fac-\nulty members at would-be host institutions have resisted\nadministrators' demands that MOOCs be adopted in the cur-\nMOOCS and Higher Education\nRegulation\nFinally, MOOCs are connected to a shifting, albeit contested,\nregulatory environment for higher education systems. Bill\nSB520 making its way through the California state legisla-\nture, strongly opposed by faculty groups, would require\npublic HEIs to accept approved MOOCs for credit in cases\nwhere there are insufficient resources to provide campus-\nbased courses. Educational outsourcing and unbundling have\nalready prompted the U.S. Education Department to allow\nstudent aid to be approved for competency-based education\nso that institutions can more easily award degree credits\nbased on prior learning (formal and informal) and nontradi-\ntional courses rather than credit hours completed (Field,\n2013). Support among politicians at the national level is\nextraordinarily strong and has included presidential advo-\ncacy for incentives that would encourage the adoption of\ncompetency-based education and MOOCs as low-cost higher\neducation alternatives. The U.S. Education Secretary sees\nMOOCs as meeting the need for \"disruptive innovation in\nhigher education\" (Marklein, 2013). Along the same lines,\nthe U.K. minister of Business Innovation and Skills has\nemphasized his government's preference for separating\n\"degree awarding powers from teaching\" so that alternative\nprivate educators can provide content that can be used at tra-\nditional HEIs for degree credits (Baker, 2011). Many see\nMOOCs as increasing the demand for--and credibility of--\nalternative credentials, such as online educational \"badges\"\nawarded for informal experience, that may one day gain\nsome acceptance alongside of conventional degrees in sec-\ntors of the labor market (Lewin, 2012). Disruptive innova-\ntion theory argues that as more content and academic services\ncan be assembled from different sources regulators and oth-\ners should adopt more flexible rules for defining the credit-\nworthiness of different skills and learning experiences. One\nprominent think tank proposes that students should be able to\nuse financial aid from non-accredited providers so that a\ntruly level playing field can be open to freelancing educators\nand learning assessment services (Kelly & Hess, 2013). Of\ncourse, as theorists of higher education have shown, increas-\ning the competition for subsidized students introduces incen-\ntives to cut corners on quality and therefore creates pressure\nAlong these lines, it is clear that MOOCs, unbundling and\noutsourced content raise questions for accreditation systems.\nOne of the major purposes of accreditation is to provide sys-\ntem-wide assurance regarding the value of degrees and\ncourses by certifying the institutions that develop them.\nThus, once an institution or program is accredited its aca-\ndemic governance system is deemed to be competent to\ndecide on the creditworthiness of courses. But it is not clear\nwhat kind of accreditation model should apply to outsourced\nor on-demand education or even the growing number of\ninstitutions that utilize content from private educational ser-\nvice firms (Eaton, 2012). A market for independent learning\nassessment services--which includes companies such as\nDegreed and learningcounts.org--has emerged to meet this\nneed in a way that parallels the new unbundled peer review\nservices we have seen in the case of scholarship. The\nAmerican Council of Education, has offered course-level\ncredit recommendations for five MOOCs offered by\nCoursera, creating a model for the independent assessment\nof creditworthiness of such courses (Lederman, 2013). Bill\nSB520 in California would go a step beyond credit recom-\nmendations by designating a state-wide pool of preapproved\nonline offerings. Elsewhere, governments are promoting the\ncreation of pan-university consortia that may create similar\npools of online offerings.6 Such examples show that the pros-\npect of academic unbundling has already begun to bring\nchanges to state or system-wide governance of HEI's in\norder to accommodate the independent provision of more\nportable academic content across institutions.\nMore than anything, MOOCs have sharpened existing\npolitical battle lines. On one side, there are those who portray\ntraditional higher education models as enjoying too much\nimmunity from market forces and public demands for greater\nacademic efficiency and productivity. On the other side are\nfaculty groups and others who are struggling against a narra-\ntive of disruption that sees higher education as a business\nwhile discounting issues of academic quality, freedom, and\ngovernance.\nConclusion\nPolicies promoting open content and disruptive forms of\nacademic unbundling are likely to transform the economics\nand social structure of higher education and research com-\nmunication. Examples such as megajournals, academic net-\nworking services, and MOOCs are all connected to a\nmarket-oriented reform of academic governance encour-\naged and managed by policymakers, key academic stake-\nholders and the for-profit and nonprofit educational industry.\nEchoing developments that have been observed in other\nareas of the modern information economy (Fuchs, 2009;\nKostakis, 2012), the emerging gift economy in academic\ncontent is closely coupled with new ways of commodifying\nacademic services.\nIn the case of research communication, we have seen that\ngovernments and stakeholders have been prepared to\nembrace open access scholarly publishing as a solution to a\ndysfunctional journals market and as a way of realizing the\npotential of the Internet to enhance the impact and produc-\ntivity of research. At the same time, the various stakeholders\nappear to have interests and incentives that may conflict\nwith some of these goals. For example, academics con-\ncerned about openness is compatible with quality do not\nseem to be prepared to fully repudiate the gatekeeping func-\ntion of academic journals and publishers. Indeed, research-\ners place a high value on journal prestige due to the norms\nand incentives of the academic commons, and this rein-\nforces the market power of publishers in a way that can\nundermine some of the goals of open access policies.\nFurthermore, university elites and researchers fear that open\naccess mandates may threaten academic freedom and insti-\ntutional autonomy, and therefore prefer to see slower and\nmore nuanced changes.\nOn the other hand, we have also seen how online digital\naccess and networking will continue to transfer many of the\nfunctions of research communication and content manage-\nment away from libraries to independent services operating\nat the trans-institutional level. In such a context, the expanded\nrole of commercial providers will perhaps allow them to\nregain some of the ground they will lose as they relinquish\nartificial scarcity in favor of more open content. But the\ninterests of the academic commons may enjoy some built-in\nprotection from disruptive market forces. This nis because\nthe academic self-governance of research communities is\nvalued by many stakeholders, and therefore does scale well\nbeyond the institutional level. Likewise, the new web 2.0\nnetworking platforms depend upon the \"trust of user com-\nmunities\" (Kostakis, 2012), which means that research ser-\nvice providers will experience some pressure to be good\npartners with the academic commons. Of course, there are\nsome fears that \"pay to publish\" could create a more uneven\nplaying field among academic disciplines and researchers\nand also increase external academic auditing beyond an opti-\nmal level. Reliance on centralized funding set aside for pub-\nlishing means more control of academic work by managers\nor even the state (Sabaratnam, 2012). At present, however,\nthe transition to open access publishing is seen as an exten-\nsion of the state's long-standing support for knowledge cre-\nation as a public good. In this respect, policymakers appear\nto be interested in reforming the traditional publishing model\nwithout necessarily disrupting the academic commons which\nthat model is meant to serve.\nIn the case of MOOCs, we have observed a greater tension\nbetween the market and the academic commons largely due\nto a more deliberate policy of unbundling and disruption.\nUnlike in the case of research communication, the policy dis-\ncourse of reform has increasingly defined higher education as\na private good and the academic gatekeeping function of tra-\nditional HEIs is portrayed as a barrier to improved productiv-\nity. Despite the \"openness\" associated with their online\naccessibility, MOOCs are meant to earn revenue within the\nformal higher education system as content licensed for use by\ninstitutions awarding degrees. Open educational resources\nhave become \"try before you buy\" marketing tools that pro-\nvide a way of leveraging scale in a new, potentially highly\nprofitable educational industry. Moreover, the industry is\nbeing aggressively enlisted by politicians keen to privatize\nthe delivery of educational services in the expectation that\nthis will help address the perceived higher education crises of\ncost, access, completion and productivity. In the process, the\nproliferation of portable and reusable educational resources--\nas well as policies and technologies that encourage academic\nfreelancing--will likely expand the relative size of the teach-\ning-only sector in higher education and challenge traditional\npractices of academic governance. One of the key goals is to\nstreamline academic work and loosen the tight coupling of\nteaching with the expensive pursuit of research and institu-\ntional rank (Christensen et al., 2011). If the productivity\nagenda of disruptive innovation succeeds on the scale imag-\nined by its proponents, the academic autonomy of institutions\nand academic professionals will likely be curtailed as curricu-\nlum is shaped and defined by forces outside of the collegial\nprocess. On the other hand, the same kind of reputational\neconomy that continues to support the market power of schol-\narly publishers may also limit the market fortunes of \"digital\ndiploma mills\" and therefore afford some protection to the\ntraditional model of higher education.\nDespite their differences, each of the cases of academic\nunbundling discussed above raises important and instructive\nchallenges for governance of the academic commons at a\ntime when its social functions and economic foundations are\nmore subject to political contestation and market-based\nreform than ever before. Indeed, it is clear that the nature of\nthis contestation has not only invited new kinds of interven-\ntion by policymakers and regulators but also new opportuni-\nties to boost the role of commercial provision and\nmarketization in the academic sphere.\n"
