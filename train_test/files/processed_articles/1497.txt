After extensive adjustment for potential confounders, the relationships between\n25(OH)D and the markers of IR and 2-h hyperglycemia persisted. Only hyperinsulinemia was\npositively associated with PTH (P  0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS -- Among U.S. adults without physician-diagnosed diabetes, low concen-\ntrations of serum 25(OH)D were associated with markers of IR. The role of PTH in IR deserves\nfurther investigation.\nThe role of vitamin D and parathyroid\nhormone (PTH) in metabolic syn-\ndrome and diabetes is receiving in-\ncreased attention. Insulin resistance (IR)\nmay represent a potential mechanism\nlinking vitamin D and PTH to these con-\nditions. The inverse associations between\nvitamin D and fasting insulin concentra-\ntions or the homeostasis model assess-\nment of IR (HOMA-IR) index have been\nreported in some (1\u00ad5) but not all studies\n(6). Moreover, evidence linking PTH to\nmarkers of IR is limited and inconsistent\n(7\u00ad9). This study examined whether se-\nand PTH are associated with surrogate\nmarkers of IR in U.S. adults without phy-\nsician-diagnosed diabetes.\nMETHODS -- We used data from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\nticipants who were aged 20 years,\nattended the morning examination after\nfasting 8 h, and had not been diagnosed\nwith diabetes were included as were par-\nticipants with undiagnosed diabetes (fast-\nwere measured using a radioimmunoas-\nsay procedure.

The quintiles of 25(OH)D and\nPTH were created after taking into account\nthe sampling weights.\nPlasma concentrations of fasting and\n2-h glucose, fasting insulin, and GHb\nwere adjusted for differences in labora-\ntory methodology between NHANES\ncose tolerance test data were available\nfined fasting hyperglycemia as a fasting\nGHb as a value of 6.0%. HOMA-IR in-\ndex was calculated as (fasting plasma in-\nsulin [mU/l]  fasting plasma glucose\n[mmol/l])/22.5. Hyperinsulinemia and\nhigh HOMA-IR were defined using the\nweighted 75th percentiles.\nCovariates in our analyses included\nage, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smok-\ning, physical activity, alcohol drinking,\nBMI, abdominal obesity, and serum cal-\nipants without physician-diagnosed\nanalyses after excluding those who had\nmissing values for study variables. The\nprevalence of surrogate markers of IR was\nlation. Linear trends across quintiles of\n25(OH)D and PTH were tested using or-\nthogonal contrasts in SUDAAN software.\nMultiple logistic regression analyses were\nconducted to test associations of 25(OH)D\nor PTH with markers of IR.\npants, 118 had undiagnosed diabetes.\n                                                \nFrom the Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nCorresponding author: Guixiang Zhao, gzhao@cdc.gov.\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the\nofficial position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u00a9 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.

After excluding participants\nwithout physician-diagnosed diabetes\nbut who had diabetes based on fasting\nglucose or GHb values, similar results\nwere observed except the significant asso-\nciation between high GHb and 25(OH)D\ndisappeared.\nInteractions between race/ethnicity\nand 25(OH)D for outcome measures were\nnot significant in the full models.\nThe prevalence of hyperinsulinemia,\nhigh HOMA-IR, high GHb, and 2-h hy-\nperglycemia increased linearly, and the\nprevalence of fasting hyperglycemia in-\ncreased nonlinearly across quintiles of\nPTH. After adjusting for demographic\nand lifestyle factors, the ORs for hyperin-\nsulinemia, high HOMA-IR, and high GHb\nwere significantly higher in the highest\nthan in the lowest quintile of PTH, and\nsignificantly increasing trends existed for\nall measures except for 2-h hyperglyce-\nmia. After further adjusting for all\npotential confounders, most of the as-\nsociations lost statistical significance;\nonly an increasing trend for hyperinsu-\nlinemia across quintiles of PTH per-\nsisted (P  0.05). These results did not\nchange much after excluding participants\nwithout physician-diagnosed diabetes\nbut who had diabetes based on fasting\nglucose or GHb values.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Our findings of\nan inverse association between 25(OH)D\nand IR among adults without physician-\ndiagnosed diabetes are consistent with\nprevious findings from cross-sectional\n(1\u00ad4) and prospective (5) studies. These\nresults offer further support that lower\nconcentrations of 25(OH)D may be a pre-\ndictor of increased likelihood of diabetes\nCompared with previous studies that\nexamined the associations of 25(OH)D\nwith IR (1\u00ad4), an advantage of our study\nwas that we were able to simultaneously\nexamine the associations between serum\n25(OH)D and PTH--both of which play\nan essential role in regulating calcium ho-\nmeostasis--and IR. In addition, we were\nable to adjust for overall obesity (i.e.,\nBMI) and abdominal obesity, which were\nstrong confounders for the analyses. The\nexpression of vitamin D receptors in both\npancreatic -cells and skeletal muscle\ncells, which, upon activation by vitamin D\nsupplementation, result in increased in-\nsulin release and responsiveness to insu-\nlin for glucose transport (14), may serve\nas an underlying mechanism.\nOur results regarding possible racial/\nethnic disparities in the associations of\n25(OH)D with IR conflict with those from\nScragg et al. (3). Given the high propor-\ntion of African Americans with vitamin D\ndeficiency or insufficiency, the issue of\npossible racial/ethnic disparities deserves\nfurther investigation (15).\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism was as-\nsociated with impaired glucose tolerance,\ninsulin insensitivity, and diabetes (7).\nHowever, a significant correlation be-\ntween PTH and HOMA-IR was observed\nin adults aged 70 years with an average\naged, morbidly obese adults (average BMI\nducted in selected populations, and the\ndata analyses did not adequately control\nfor potential confounders. Our study,\nbased on a nationally representative sam-\nple, showed a significant association be-\ntween PTH and hyperinsulinemia after\nadjusting for potential confounders.\nHowever, analyses limited to participants\nconcentrations begin to increase, revealed\nno associations between PTH and hyper-\ninsulinemia or HOMA-IR.\nOur study was limited by the inability\nto establish the causality between 25(OH)D\nand IR based on our cross-sectional study\nand by the inability to account for sunlight\nexposure due to lack of data.\nIn conclusion, low concentrations of\n25(OH)D were associated with markers\nof IR among U.S. adults without physi-\ncian-diagnosed diabetes. Future prospec-\ntive studies and intervention trials are\nneeded to confirm the associations of\n25(OH)D with IR and to further investi-\ngate the role of PTH in IR.\n"
