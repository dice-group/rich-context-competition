Despite\nthe vast number of studies, the informational basis for equidistance perception is unknown. There\nare three possible sources of information for spatial equidistance in pictures, namely, distances in\nthe picture plane, in physical space, and visual space. For each source, equidistant intervals were\ncomputed for perspective photographs of walls and canals. Intervals appear equidistant if\nequidistance is defined in visual space. Equidistance was further investigated in paintings of\nperspective scenes. In appraisals of the perspective skill of painters, emphasis has been on\naccurate use of vanishing points. The current study investigated the skill of painters to depict\nequidistant intervals. Depicted rows of equidistant columns, tiles, tapestries, or trees were\nanalyzed in 30 paintings and engravings. Computational analysis shows that from the middle\nages until now, artists either represented equidistance in physical space or in a visual space of\nvery limited depth. Among the painters and engravers who depict equidistance in a highly\nnonveridical visual space are renowned experts of linear perspective.\n",

Little is known about the\nsensitivity of human vision to equidistance in depth. Even the spatial information employed\nstill awaits discovery. Information may come from one of three possible sources. Figure 1\nshows predictions for bisection of a spatial interval in a picture. Bisection may be related to\nthe proximal (Figure 1(a)), distal (Figure 1(b)), or perceived (Figure 1(c)) stimulus. The image\nin the picture plane is taken to be equivalent with the proximal image. If information is\nextracted from the proximal stimulus, b will bisect interval ac if ab equals bc (Figure 1(a)).\nThis type of bisection will be called proximal bisection. If bisection is related to the layout of\nthe distal stimulus, p, that is, the projection of bisection point P of the physical interval AC\nonto the picture plane will generally not bisect interval ac (Figure 1(b)). The position of p is\ncloser to c than a, if A is nearer to the observer than C. Lines parallel to AC meet at the\ninfinitely far vanishing point VP. This type of bisection in a picture is dubbed bisection in\nphysical space. A third option is that bisection is related to the layout of the stimulus in visual\nspace (Figure 1(c)). Many studies have shown that visual space, that is, the space we perceive\nthrough vision, differs from physical space. A recent reanalysis of classic experimental results\nunveiled that physical space and visual space and also the proximal image are perspective\ntransformations of each other (Erkelens, 2015a). The spaces differ by just a single parameter,\nnamely, the distance of vanishing points. The distance is infinite for physical space, finite for\nvisual space, and zero for the proximal image. The new model is simpler and more powerful\nthan the model of a curved visual space championed by Luneburg (1947, 1950) and Blank\nFigure 1. Bisection of a spatial interval in a picture in side views. Observer O views a picture (vertical gray\nline) that contains the proximal stimulus. (a) Bisection in the picture plane. The yellow dot b bisects interval\nac if ab \u00bc bc. (b) Bisection in physical space. A, C, and VP are distal stimuli for a, c, and the vanishing point vp\nin the picture, respectively. AC is parallel to the line connecting O and the infinitely far VP. P bisects interval\nAC. The cyan dot p is the proximal stimulus of P. (c) Bisection in visual space. A, C, and VP are perceived at\nA0, C0, and VP0, respectively. VP0 is located at a finite distance. V bisects A0C0. The magenta dot v is the\nproximal stimulus of V.\n(1953, 1961) because it describes more experimental data. In Figure 1(c), line piece AC in\nphysical space transforms to line piece A0C0 in visual space. Lines parallel to AC in physical\nspace converge in visual space to vanishing point VP0, located at finite distance from the\nobserver. V bisects A0C0 in visual space. Point v is the projection of V onto the picture plane.\nThe position of v differs from that of b (Figure 1(a)) and p (Figure 1(b)). Point v is located in\nbetween b and p at a position that depends on the distance of vanishing point VP0. In\nprinciple, human observers have access to each of the three sources of information.\nProximal intervals are directly available from the retinal image. Most assessments of\nspatial intervals, however, are made across fixations and, hence, require a spatiotopic map\nof saccade locations in addition to the retinal image. Intervals in physical space follow from\nknowledge based on interactions of the observer with the physical environment. Intervals in\nvisual space are available from quantitative probes of visual perception.\nTo explore equidistance in perspective pictures, bisection locations were computed for\nspatial intervals in photographs of a wall and a canal (Figure 2). Pairs of parallel white\nlines represent spatial interval ac shown in Figure 1. Positions of the three bisection points\nwere computed by solving the geometric equations that describe bisection according to the\ndifferent sources of information. Measurement of the horizontal (wall) or vertical (canal)\npositions of the white lines in the photographs provided the positions of a and c. Positions of\nthe vanishing point projections (vp) were obtained by measuring the positions of intersections\nof perspective lines in the pictures. The equations for bisection in the physical and visual\nspaces were solvable for known intersection positions between extensions of AC and A0C0\nand the screen. A position at one screen size outside of the screen border was chosen as the\nposition of intersection. Proximal bisection positions were directly computed from the\npositions of a and c on the screen. Veridicality of computed bisection positions in physical\nspace was verified by counting the segments of the concrete wall and the trees along the canal\nin the picture. The positions of bisection in visual space were computed by further assuming\nthat the vanishing point VP0 was located at twice the viewing distance of the photographs.\nIt requires a ruler to convince oneself that the yellow dots bisect the intervals between the\nparallel white lines in the photographs (Figure 2). The necessity of having to rely on a ruler\nFigure 2. Computed bisection positions in photographs of perspective scenes. (a) Bisections along a\nvertical surface. The yellow dot bisects the interval between the parallel white lines in the picture. The cyan\ndot bisects the interval in physical space, the magenta dot in visual space. The end of visual space is assumed\nto be at twice the viewing distance. (b) Similar bisections along a horizontal surface. Converging white lines\nare perspective lines meeting at vanishing points.\nErkelens 3\nsuggests that equidistance judgments are not based on measures of the proximal stimulus.\nThis suggestion is in line with earlier bisection results of Blank (1961) and a recent study\nshowing that the detection of two-dimensional symmetry patterns is subject to the three-\ndimensional (3D) configuration of scenes (Chen & Shio, 2015). Acceptance of the cyan dots\nas indicators of bisection in physical space is based on cognition rather than visual\nperception. As mentioned earlier, counting trees and wall segments was needed to make\neducated guesses about bisection in physical space. Visually the cyan dots appear much\ntoo close to the distant lines. The magenta dots seem better candidates for visual bisection.\nComputed positions of the magenta dots depend on the assumed distance of vanishing point.\nDue to individual differences between computed depths of visual space (Erkelens, 2015b), the\nmagenta dots may represent suboptimal positions for bisection to individual observers.\nPicture Positions of Equidistant Positions in Physical Space\nTo quantify the effect of the selected intersection positions between stimulus and screen on\nbisection positions in the picture, bisection positions were computed for a range of\nintersection positions. Bisection in physical space proved to be independent of the chosen\nintersection position. If a, c, and vp have fixed positions on the screen then all possible\nintervals AC in physical space are parallel to each other (Figure 1(b)). Inspection of\nFigures 1(b) and 3(a) shows that parallel displacement of AC does not affect the position\nof p because all triangles OAC are similar. On the other hand, bisection in visual space does\ndepend on the position of the intersection point. Potential intervals A0C0 rotate relative to\neach other about the finite vanishing point and consequently the position of v changes with\nthe orientation of A0C0. Bisection in physical space proved also to be independent of the\nposition of the observer relative to the picture. Computations of p showed that if a, c, and vp\nwere kept at fixed positions, the position of p remained fixed for all directions of O relative to\nthe picture (Figure 3(b)). Computations of p also showed that the position of p remained\nfixed for all viewing distances (Figure 3(c)). As a result, the position of p in the picture is\nindependent of distance and direction of the observer relative to the picture. The position of p\nis fully specified by the positions of a, c, and vp and thus only by aspects of the picture itself.\nProximal bisection and bisection in physical space share this property.\nThe method for establishing bisection positions in pictures can be generalized to\nequidistant positions for any number of intervals. Computations were made for larger\nnumbers of equidistant intervals. Figure 4(a) shows the geometry for a row of four\nequidistant intervals in physical space. Positions of the proximal stimuli p depend only on\nthe positions of a, c, and vp. Figure 4(b) shows the positions of p as functions of the position\nof c relative to the positions of a and vp. Similar as for bisection, the positions of a, c, and vp\nin the picture uniquely specify the division in intervals. Geometric analysis shows that, what\nmay seem counterintuitive, knowledge of the distal stimulus in physical space is irrelevant for\nthe division of a line piece in equidistant intervals in a picture.\nEquidistant Intervals in Perspective Photographs\nTo compare equidistance in the various spaces, equidistant intervals were computed for the\nperspective photographs of wall and canal that were earlier shown in Figure 2. Figure 5\nshows intervals that are equidistant in the picture (Figure 5(a) and (b)), in physical space\n(Figure 5(c) and (d)), and in visual space (Figure 5(e) and (f)). One can interpret the sizes of\nintervals in two ways. One can interpret their sizes in terms of distances in depth along the\nunderlying surface or compare their sizes relative to each other in terms of viewing angles.\nFigure 3. Independence of bisection in physical space for stimulus distance and viewing position. Points a, c,\nand vp have fixed positions in the picture (gray vertical line) identical to those shown in Figure 1(b). P bisects\ninterval AC. p is the projection of P onto the picture plane. (a) In comparison to Figure 1(b), AC has been\nplaced at a different distance from the screen. Different distances do not affect the position of p. (b, c) O has\nbeen placed at other positions. Different viewing directions do not affect p (b). Different viewing distances do\nnot affect p (c).\nFigure 4. Equidistant intervals in physical space. Positions of a, c, and vp are identical to those shown in\nFigure 1(b). (a) AC is divided in four equidistant intervals. The colored dots P are associated with \u00bc, \u00bd, and\ng of interval AC, respectively. Identically colored p's are their proximal stimuli. (b) The three p's are\ncomputed as functions of c relative to a and v. Colors of the lines match the colors of P in (a).\nErkelens 5\nEquidistant intervals in the plane of the picture (Figure 5(a) and (b)) are not perceived as\nequidistant according to either interpretation. Intervals that are identical in terms of visual\nangle but viewed at different distances are perceived differently according to the\nsize--distance invariance hypothesis (Epstein, 1963; Wagner, 2006). The intervals are also\nperceived as different if one tries to ignore the depth of the surface. The perceived increase in\nline spacing with increasing surface depth even persists if a ruler is placed across the lines.\nIncompatibility between perceived intervals and ruler readings presents a strong visual\nillusion. Spatial intervals that are equidistant in physical space (Figure 5(c) and (d)) are\nalso perceived as highly different from each other. By reasoning, one can accept that the\nintervals are equidistant along the receding surfaces. However, the decrease in line spacing\nFigure 5. Equidistant intervals between five lines in perspective photographs of a wall and a canal. Intervals\nbetween yellow lines are equidistant in the picture plane (a, b). Intervals between cyan lines (c, d) are\nequidistant in physical space. Intervals between magenta lines (e, f) are equidistant in visual space. The\nvanishing point of visual space was assumed at twice the viewing distance of the pictures.\nappears to progress irregularly with surface depth. The near intervals seem overly large, most\nprominent in the canal example of Figure 5(d). Sizes of intervals appear to decrease more\nregularly with distance if the intervals are computed in visual space (Figure 5(e) and (f)).\nSimilar to the computed bisection intervals of Figure 2, a distance of twice the viewing\ndistance was chosen for the vanishing point. Now the intervals appear to decrease in size\nrather regularly with distance. Such a decrease is in agreement with the size--distance\ninvariance hypothesis that was mentioned earlier. The gradient in interval size appears\nregular and more natural when the intervals are computed in visual (Figure 5(e) and (f))\nrather than physical space (Figure 5(c) and (d)).\nEquidistant Intervals in Perspective Paintings and Engravings\nTo gain insight in how we perceive equidistance in pictures, it may be illuminating to\ninvestigate how painters, both amateurs and experts in linear perspective, have depicted\nequidistant intervals on canvas (Kemp, 1990; Kubovy, 1986). Veridical depiction of\nequidistant intervals in 3D scenes prescribes that painters have to follow the geometric\nrules of linear perspective in relation physical space. It is known that Italian painters such\nas Filippo Brunelleschi and Piero della Francesca already applied rules and constructions of\nlinear perspective in the 15th century. To compare the depiction of equidistant intervals by\nartists across the ages, photographs of paintings and engravings were copied from the\ninternet (see Appendix 1). Fragments were selected that contained four equidistant\nintervals and their associated vanishing point. An exception was made for ``The Last\nSupper'' and its followers because the images contained rows of only three equidistant\nintervals. The fragments were displayed on the computer screen so that they fully filled the\nscreen. Coordinates of borders of intervals and vanishing points were measured in millimeters\nrelative to the left and lower border of the screen, using a ruler. The near border of the\nnearest interval was designated a and the far border of the fourth (third for the Last Supper\npictures) interval b (Figure 1). Intermediate interval borders were computed from the\nequations describing proximal equidistance, and equidistant intervals in physical and\nvisual space, respectively. Since in visual space intervals depend on distance of the\nvanishing point and intersection position of the perceived surface with the screen, borders\nwere computed for a wide range of vanishing distances and intersection positions.\nCombinations of vanishing distance and intersection position that produced the best fits\nbetween computed and painted borders were supposed to describe the visual space that\nwas used by the painter.\nDepth (D) of visual space in a picture is defined as distance of the vanishing point relative\nto the observer minus viewing distance of the picture. Figure 6 shows fragments of three\npaintings and one engraving. The tiles of Vermeer's ``The Music Lesson'' show intervals that\nclosely match equidistant intervals in a specific visual space (Figure 6(a)). The optimal visual\nspace has a depth larger than 100 viewing distances. It is indistinguishable from physical\nspace within the precision of the computations. Agreement of the painted intervals with\nintervals in physical space shows that Vermeer accurately followed the rules of linear\nperspective. It has been proposed that Vermeer used a camera obscura to achieve such a\nphotograph-like veridicality (Steadman, 2001). The other panels of Figure 6 show that such\nan agreement was not always found in paintings and engravings. Leonardo da Vinci painted\ntapestries in ``The Last Supper'' that are not equidistant in physical space although the errors\nare not very large (Figure 6(b)). However, there is a visual space clearly different from\nphysical space that describes Leonardo's intervals much better. This visual space has a\ndepth of 11 viewing distances. Differences between depicted and computed intervals in\nErkelens 7\nrelation to physical space are much larger for the engraving of a tomb by Hans Vredeman de\nVries (Figure 6(c)) and the painting of Canaletto of ``The Interior of Henry VII's Chapel in\nWestminster Abbey'' (Figure 6(d)). In both pictures, the best fitting borders that indicate\nequidistant intervals in visual space (magenta dots) are about in the middle between those\nindicating equidistant intervals in physical space (cyan dots) and the picture plane (yellow\ndots). Visual space in these pictures has a depth of just two viewing distances.\nDepth of visual space was computed for 30 pictures. Paintings and engravings were\nselected in which perspective was applied with great accuracy. Paintings such as for\ninstance ``Mystery and Melancholy of a Street'' (1914) of Giorgio de Chirico were\nexcluded because of inaccuracy in vanishing points. Computed depths of visual spaces can\nbe divided into two groups. In one group of 12 paintings and 2 engravings, depths are larger\nthan 100 viewing distances (Table 1). These visual spaces are indistinguishable from physical\nspace implying that the artists accurately applied the rules of linear perspective. In the other\ngroup of 15 paintings and 1 engraving, depths of visual spaces are shorter than 12 viewing\ndistances (Table 2). Mean depth and standard deviation of this group is 5.2 \u00c6 3.2 viewing\ndistances. From the middle ages until now, artists have painted equidistant intervals in\nphysical space (D > 100) or visual space. Mean absolute error (MAE) and standard\ndeviation is 1.7 \u00c6 1.0% for the physical space group and 1.4 \u00c6 1.0% for the visual space\nFigure 6. Equidistant intervals in art.

This means that MAEs are usually just a few percent of interval lengths. Most artists\napplied exclusively perspective related to physical or visual space. The Dutch architect and\npainter Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527\u00ad1607) is here the exception. He applied the rules of\nlinear perspective in relation to physical space with great accuracy in engravings, published in\na book on perspective. On the other hand, he painted an architectural fantasy of a palace and\nTable 2.

Pictures as\nplanar equivalents of proximal images are also perspective transformations of physical space.\nPhysical space, visual space, and pictures are perspective spaces that just differ by the size of a\nsingle parameter, namely, the distance of vanishing points. Distances are infinite in physical\nspace, finite in visual space, and zero in pictures. The idea of visual space as a perspective\nspace arose from observations that perceived angles between in-depth oriented rails and bars\nare weighted averages between the physical angles and the angles in the proximal image\n(Erkelens, 2015b, 2015c). Perspective transformation of space affects distances but leaves\ndirections unchanged. Therefore, vanishing points have identical directions relative to the\nobserver in physical space, visual space, and the proximal image (Figure 1). As a\nconsequence, studies on the quality of linear perspective in paintings and drawings are\nincomplete if analysis is confined to the accuracy of vanishing points. Complete studies of\nlinear perspectives should include analysis of distances. The current study analyzed how\nequidistant intervals in physical and visual space relate to intervals in pictures.\nThe computations involved relative distances along straight lines. This means that linear\nerrors in pictures caused by stretching did not affect the results. Linear errors occur for\ninstance when changes are made in the aspect ratio of pictures. Higher order errors cause\nstraight lines to become curved. Analysis of the vanishing points did not reveal such errors in\nphoto's and paintings that were downloaded from the internet.\nOne result of the current analysis is that, if intervals in a picture indicate equidistance in\nphysical space, they do so for all viewing positions and distances of the physical stimulus to\nthe picture. These invariances have not been reported until now and are a remarkable aspect\nof linear perspective in relation to physical space. The invariances do not hold for linear\nperspective in relation to visual space. Since the 15th century, many artists have used\nconstruction methods to depict intervals that are equidistant in physical space along in-\ndepth oriented lines. A consequence of the invariances is that, if such methods are used,\nintervals in the picture still correctly indicate equidistant intervals in physical space for\nviewpoints other than the one from which the picture is made. The invariance may explain\nwhy photographs and movies viewed from oblique directions are perceived as being rotated\nEquidistant Intervals in Paintings\nIt is remarkable how artists depict equidistant intervals in paintings and engravings. The\nstudied intervals show that a great number of artists, intentionally or not, applied\nperspective in relation to visual instead of physical space. Among the painters who strongly\ndeviated from equidistance in physical space are renowned experts of linear perspective such as\nPanini, Piranesi, and Canaletto (Thompson, 2003). The vanishing points in the paintings and\nengravings of this study show that all artists applied linear perspective with great accuracy, as\nfar as directions are concerned. The small MAEs between depicted and computed intervals\nshow that for distances painters applied perspective with great accuracy too. This is true for all\nartists in this study because, in general, MAEs were equally small for equidistance in visual\nand physical space. Small MAEs are remarkable for paintings showing equidistant intervals in\nvisual space because their makers could not use tools or tricks to achieve a high degree of\nperfection. In contrast, artists drawing equidistant intervals in physical space could use\nmethods such as the costruzione legittima. Such methods do not exist for equidistance in\nvisual space. Making use of yardsticks in the plane of the picture would not have been\nhelpful either, as the yellow dots show in Figure 6.\nArtists have pictured equidistant intervals either in physical or visual space from the 15th\ncentury until now. Realist painters such as Johannes Vermeer, Gustave Caillebotte, Carel\nWillink, Richard Estes applied perspective in relation to physical space to arrive at\nphotograph-like veridicality. Painters such as Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Vredeman de Vries,\nand Dirck van Delen used perspective in relation to visual space in their fantasy paintings. The\nvedute painters Antonio Joli, Giovanni Panini, Giovanni Piranesi, and Canaletto applied\nperspective in relation to visual space both in their fantasy and realistic paintings. From\nvisual inspection alone, it is difficult to distinguish nonveridical from veridical perspective.\nFor example, ``The Last Supper'' and the ``tomb'' of Hans Vredeman de Vries appear as\nrealistic as ``The Music Lesson'' and the ``Interior of Henry VII's Chapel'' (Figure 6).\nComputation first shows the considerable differences. Hans Vredeman de Vries, an engineer\nby training, may have been aware of the distinction between both types of perspective because\nhe applied both techniques. He purposely may have applied perspective in relation to visual\nspace for one or two reasons. He may have found the painting more attractive or he used it\nbecause it allowed him to draw distant objects in more detail than in the case of linear\nperspective. Distant objects are most compressed in linear perspective, less in visual space,\nand not at all in physical space. The latter reason is particularly relevant for engravings where\ndepicting details is limited by the coarseness of the needles. It is amusing to notice that\nperspective in relation to visual space has been applied in the ``Terror Subterra'' illusion\n(Shepard, 1990). It is amusing because the illusion is generally explained by the size\u00addepth\nrelationship of projections from physical space onto planar surfaces. Another example of\nerroneous projection is given by an instruction video on how to draw perspective (last item\nof Table 2). It shows intervals that are equidistant within an extremely confined visual space.\nApparently, both viewers and makers are not aware of the errors of projection.\nThe fact that expert painters depict perspective in relation to visual space seems\nparadoxical. Projections of 3D scenes on flat surfaces contain linear perspective. These\nphotographic projections produce retinal images identical to those produced by the 3D\nscenes themselves. When using projections based on perspective in relation to visual space\nin the painting, one would be inclined to conclude that the ensuing visual perception of the\nscene would be nonveridical and nonrealistic. On the contrary, perspective related to visual\nspace is experienced as very natural in paintings (see the examples in Figures 5 and 6). An\nexplanation for the paradox may be that perception of 3D scenes in pictures differs from\nperception of real scenes (Erkelens, 2015b, 2015c). To emphasize this difference, visual space\nin pictures is generally named pictorial space. Apparently, about half of the investigated\npainters used perspective in relation to visual space so that in the pictures the depicted\nintervals appeared consistent with other attributes of depth.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nBlank, A.

Erkelens, earned a degree in physics from Radboud\nUniversity at Nijmegen and his PhD from Utrecht University. He\ncommenced his eye movement research with Han Collewijn at\nErasmus University Rotterdam. His academic career continued at\nthe Physics and Psychology departments of Utrecht University.\nInitially, research was devoted to describing and understanding\nbinocular eye movements. Later, his interest progressively\nexpanded to the processes underlying binocular vision and their\nrelationship to eye movements. Currently, he works on conflicts\nbetween binocular and monocular vision that may arise when 3-D\nscenes are imaged on 2-D media such as paper, canvas and the\nvarious kinds of (projection) screens. After his compulsory\nretirement in 2015, the dean of the faculty of Social Sciences of Utrecht University granted\nfacilities enabling him to continue research.\nAppendix 1\nURLs of the Pictures of Table 1\nFra Carnevale, http://www.wga.hu/index1.html\nPiero della Francesca, http://www.wga.hu/index1.html\nHans Vredeman de Vries, www.relewis.com/devries-perspective_link.html\nHans Vredeman de Vries, https://ojs.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.php/nsr/article/download/\nPieter Jansz.
