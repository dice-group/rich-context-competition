Therefore, the objective of this\npresent study was to evaluate the effects of\nzolpidem on behavioural function, neural\nplasticity and memory in a rat model of\nacute ischemic stroke and to examine pos-\nsible antioxidant properties.\nMaterials and methods\nRat model of ischemic stroke\nSix-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats\ncages in a controlled environment (22.0\u00ad\ncycle with free access to food and water.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee of the\nMedical Research Institute in Kangbuk\nSamsung Hospital, Republic of Korea\nThe model of ischemic stroke in the rat\nwas produced by the Longa method,18\nwhereby the middle cerebral artery was\noccluded for two hours and re-perfused.\nRats were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane\nO) and heating pads\nwere used to maintain their body tempera-\nover the middle of the neck and the left\ncommon carotid artery exposed. After sep-\naration of the internal and external carotid\narteries, a 4/0 nylon filament with a rounded\ntip was inserted into the bifurcation of the\ncommon carotid artery until the nylon tip\noccluded the common carotid artery. The\ninserted nylon was removed after two hours\nof occlusion for the transient focal cerebral\ninfarction.\nBehavioural function measurements\nTo investigate the effects of zolpidem on\nmotor recovery after an acute ischemic\ninjury, rats were randomly assigned to one\nor 4.0 mg/kg zolpidem or normal saline) and\ntreatments were administered by intraper-\nitoneal (IP) injection once daily (i.e., 10 am)\nfor two weeks starting the day after the\nischemic stroke procedure (Day 1). Weight\nwas measured on Day 1 and two weeks later\n(Day 14) and the percentage ratio calcu-\nlated. Behavioural function was measured\nby a blinded researcher (K.J.Y.) on Day 1\nand Day 14 using the motor behavioural\nindex (MBI). 19 The half-life of zolpidem is\n2\u00ad3 hours20 and so scores were measured at\n3 pm to avoid its sleeping effect. The MBI\nwhich has six items (i.e., spontaneous activ-\nity, symmetry of the four limbs, forepaw\noutstretching, climbing, body propriocep-\ntion and response to vibrissae touch) has a\ntotal score range of 3\u00ad18 with high scores\nindicating better behavioural function than\nlower scores. The ratio in MBI (%) was\ncalculated as the score at Day 14/the score at\nMemory function measurements\nTo assess the effect of the zolpidem on\nmemory function, the radial 8-arm maze\n(RAM) test was performed at 3 pm on Day 1\nand Day 14. The RAM has eight U-shaped\nwere placed radially around a hexagonal\nplatform (10 cm) on the floor surrounded by\nvisual markers. After food restriction for\nhalf a day, rats were placed on the hexagonal\nplatform and allowed to find and eat four\nhidden sugar baits out of eight pellets which\nwere set at the end of each arm. Rats were\npre-trained twice daily for five days before\nthe ischemic stroke procedure. All situations\nincluding the location of RAM on the floor\nand the sugar bait pellets were identical. The\ntime taken to find and eat four sugar bait\npellets was recorded by one blinded investi-\ngator (K.J.Y.). The ratio in RAM (%) was\ncalculated as the time at Day 14/the time at\nBrain imaging\nMRI scans of the brain were performed on\nDay 1 and Day 14 to evaluate the change in\ninfarction volume. Rats were anesthetized\nwith an IP injection of 1.0% ketamine and\nplaced on a 4.7 T Bruker Biospec Imager\n(Bruker medical system, Kalsruhe,\nGermany). The warm magnetic bore main-\ntained the rats' body temperature. The\nprotocol for MRI imaging included a diffu-\nsion weighted image (DWI) sequence (TR/\nThe slice thickness was 1.5 mm and the\nvolumes which were measured by a blinded\nresearcher (Y.T.L.) using Paravision 3.0\nsoftware (Bruker Biospec, Ettlingen,\nGermany) were obtained from DWI at\nThe ratio in infarction volume (%) was\nImmunohistochemistry\nOn Day 14, rats were anesthetized with\nisoflurane and perfused transcardially with\nphosphate-buffered solution. Brains were\nremoved, fixed in 10% formalin for one\nweek, dehydrated in a graded ethanol\nseries, embedded in paraffin, and processed\nfor a paraffin block which was cut in\n6mm thick sections. For immunostaining,\nthe sections were de-paraffinized in\nxylene, rehydrated in a graded series of\nethanol, washed with normal saline and\nmicrowaved in citrate buffer for 10 min.\nHydrogen peroxide was used to block\nendogenous peroxidase activity which\nenhanced nonspecific immunoreactivity.\nTwo antibodies, brain-derived neuro-\nAbcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and indu-\ncible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, ab3523,\n1/20, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were\nused to evaluate the upregulation of neural\nplasticity and antioxidant effects, respect-\ndigitized using a 40 \u00c2 objective (Leica\nDFC 290, Leica, Heerbrugg, Germany) in\nconjunction with the Leica Application\nsuite (version 3.3.0, Leica). Five views\nfrom each area of the peri-lesional\nsite were assessed by a pathologist blinded\nto the experimental conditions (S.W.C.)\nand stained cells were counted and\naveraged.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS software (PASW Statistics for\nWindows\u00d5, version 18.0. Chicago, USA.).\nData were analysed using the Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis test and a P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered to indicate statistical significance.\nThe Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni\ncorrection was used to analyse between\ngroup differences if the P-value was\nsignificant.\nResults\nIn total, 42 rats, six in each group, were\nrandomly assigned to one of seven groups\nzolpidem or normal saline). There were no\nstatistically significant differences among the\ngroups in rat weight or MBI at Day 1. The\nively. MBI scores (mean \u00c6 SD) for the 0.1,\nFor weight ratio, there were no differ-\nences among the groups from Day 1 to Day\n14. For MBI ratio (%), compared with the\nnormal saline group, the zolpidem 0.5 mg/kg\nand 1.0 mg/kg groups had statistically sig-\nnificantly (P < 0.005) better improvements\nin scores over the two weeks (Figure 1). By\ncontrast, the group receiving zolpidem\n4.0 mg/kg had a statistically significant\n(P < 0.005) deterioration in scores compared\nwith the group receiving normal saline\n(Figure 1).\nFor RAM, there were no differences\namong the groups at Day 1. With the excep-\ntion of the zolpidem 2.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg\ngroups which were excluded from the ana-\nlysis because of incomplete data, there was\nalso no difference among groups in the\nDay14/Day 1 RAM ratio. Initial RAM\n1.0 mg/kg zolpidem and normal saline groups\nkg zolpidem and normal saline groups were\nBrain MRI scans showed that there were\nno statistically significant differences in\ninfarction volumes among the groups at\nDay 1 or in the ratio of infarction volumes\nImmunohistochemistry showed that by\ncomparison with the normal saline group,\ngroups had statistically significantly\nstained cells (Figures 3a and 4a). However,\nthere were no differences among groups in\nthe expression of iNOS (Figures 3b and 4b).\nDiscussion\nThis present study showed that two weeks\nafter a stroke, rats in the 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg\nzolpidem groups had significant improve-\nment in behavioural function compared\nwith rats in the control group. In addition,\nthe same two zolpidem dose groups had\nsignificantly increased numbers of BDNF\nstained cells compared with the control\ngroup which indicated upregulation of\nneural plasticity.21 However, there was no\ndifference in iNOS expression among the\ngroups suggesting that functional recovery\nwith zolpidem was not associated with anti-\noxidant effects. Although data are lacking to\nsubstantiate the hypothesis that zolpidem\nmay have exerted a neuroplastic effect by\ninhibiting hyper-excitable states caused by\nneurotransmitters such as glutamate,\npatients with brain injuries23 and with\nParkinson's disease24 have been shown to\nbenefit from zolpidem in terms of motor\nrecovery.\nInterestingly, the group receiving the\nhighest dose of zolpidem (4.0 mg/kg)\nshowed a significant deterioration of behav-\nioural function 14 days weeks after the\nstroke. While lower doses of zolpidem have\na neuroplastic effect, higher doses may be\nassociated with inhibition of the recovery\nmechanism. For example, a previous study\nFigure 1.

By contrast, the\ngroup receiving zolpidem (Zp) 4.0 mg/kg had a statistically significant *** (P < 0.005) deterioration in scores\ncompared with the group receiving normal saline (n/s).\nFigure 2.

Previous studies in\nhumans assessing the effects of zolpidem\non memory function have produced con-\nflicting results.26\u00ad28 By contrast with the\ncurrent study, these previous studies\nincluded healthy volunteers and evaluated\nthe immediate effects (i.e., within 24 h) of\nzolpidem.\nNo differences among groups were also\nobserved in the Day1/Day 14 ratio of\ninfarction volumes. The lack of effect of\nzolpidem on infarction volumes may be\nrelated to the length of the dosing period.\nPerhaps a dosing schedule of longer than\ntwo weeks is required to achieve an effect of\nzolpidem on the size of the ischemic lesion.\nThe study had some limitations. For\nexample, animals were only monitored for\ntwo weeks after the stroke. Further studies,\nwith an increased follow-up period are\nrequired to confirm the long-term effects of\nzolpidem. In addition, only rat models with\nmiddle cerebral artery infarction were used\nfor the study. Therefore, further studies\nusing other types of brain injuries, such as\nhaemorrhage, are required to investigate the\npossible neuroprotective action of zolpidem\nmore fully.\nIn summary, this study in a rat model\nshowed that 0.5\u00ad1.0 mg/kg of zolpidem had\nbeneficial effects on behavioural function by\nenhancing neural plasticity without causing\nany memory impairment in acute ischemic\nstroke.\n"
