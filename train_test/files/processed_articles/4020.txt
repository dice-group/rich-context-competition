Essential to this\nprocess is the acquiring of data representative of the experience being researched. The art of unstructured interviews is to\nacknowledge and value participants' stories as each participant traverses deeply personal experiences with the interviewer.\nThis article examines the impact of factors that influence the successful interviewing of peers and explores how ignoring the\nfoundational elements of \"who, where, and how\" may result in lean or even skewed data. Aimed at accessing the essence of\na phenomenon through conversational interviews, the authors offer an adaptable framework that considers the additional\nelements of \"space, language, role, and trust\" which is aligned with the intent of phenomenological studies.\n",

Interviews consistent with achiev-\ning this aim have been variously described as in-depth\ninterviews (Creswell, 2012), unstructured interviews (Corbin\n& Morse, 2003), active interviews (Holstein & Gubrium,\n1995), or conversational interviews (McConnell-Henry,\nEffective interviewing is thought to be a data collection\nmethod to broaden and deepen our professional knowledge\nby mining the experiences of individuals to construct com-\nposite understanding. However, interviewing peers is fraught\nwith complexity. Nurse to nurse interviews can involve the\nspectrum of collegial relationships from close friend to\nunknown fellow professionals (McDermid, Peters, Jackson,\n& Daly, 2014). Within the wide range of relationships, a tan-\ngle of emotions, exclusions, and assumptions may exist for\nthe participant group, and divulging these to a fellow nurse\ncould be confronting and challenging. Perception and skill\non the part of the researcher are essential to ensure that inter-\nview conversations are conducted sensitively and the out-\ncomes from conversational interviews are maximized. This\narticle explores the complexity of this dynamic in the context\nof a study of nurse family carers (NFCs) who were caring for\na relative with a chronic illness, and who were interviewed\nby a fellow nurse. A framework of strategies to embed inter-\nviewing technique within the methodological structure is\nsuggested, and discussion around the pitfalls to be avoided\nwhen interviewing peers is provided.\nBackground\nThe dual role of the nurse who is a family carer may offer a\nprivileged vantage point to effectively appraise care provi-\ninsights from this group of nurses may well provide informa-\ntion to modify and improve health care practice. The article\nwill reflect on the use of one-to-one peer interviews between\na nurse researcher and an NFC who has a family member\nwith a chronic illness to harvest rich thick descriptions of this\nA review of recent literature indicates there is minimal\ninformation that relates to the lived experience of nurses who\n1Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, Australia\n2Independent Scholar, Woodside, Victoria, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nLoretto Quinney, School of Nursing, Central Queensland University,\nBruce Highway, Rockhampton, Queensland 4701, Australia.\nEmail: loretto.quinney@cqumail.com\nWho, Where, and How of\nInterviewing Peers: Implications\nfor a Phenomenological Study\nLoretto Quinney1, Trudy Dwyer1, and Ysanne Chapman2\n Keywords\nconversational interviews, unstructured interviews, nurse, family, care-giving, hermeneutic phenomenology, Heidegger,\nMerleau-Ponty\n2 SAGE Open\ncare for family members during illness. Within the limited\npool of research, discussion dominates around the experi-\nences of nurse family members (NFMs) caring for elderly\nrelatives or relatives who have a critical or terminal illness\nWard-Griffin, 2004). However, there has been a dearth of\ninvestigation of situations where a nurse has held prolonged\nresponsibility and management for the health needs of a\nchronically ill family member. Previous studies used the\nterm nurse family member (NFM) as opposed to NFC, which\nis the focus of this study. It is important to note that the\nauthors perceive a fundamental difference that separates the\nNFM from the NFC. The NFM may fulfill a vital role for the\nperiod of an acute illness or indeed a palliative illness but\nhave no previous or continuing responsibility to care for a\nfamily member outside those circumstances. In contrast, the\nNFC has a very different commitment and has a continuing\nrole during times of remission, relapse, and recovery. The\nstudy uses the term NFC as being more representative of the\nongoing primary carer role assumed when a close relative\nhas a chronic illness.\nProfessional mores of conduct are deeply engrained\nwithin nurses and indeed the nursing culture (Shaw &\nTimmons, 2010). Succinct and objective language and emo-\ntional constraint are hallmarks of the professional demeanor\nof nurses, and these characteristics have evolved to address\nthe needs and expectations of the clinical environment.\nHowever, these attributes can present as obstacles for the\ninterviewer to be able to access the participants' experiences\nof their family carer role. Interviewing peers brings added\ndimensions and complexities of pre-existing relationships\nand power balances. More effective peer interviewing may\nresult from understanding the issues of personal interaction,\nspace and environment, and process. These issues have been\nnamed the \"Who, Where, and How\" of interviewing and will\nbe explored by using a Heideggerian hermeneutic approach.\nThe Who\nInterviewing involves interaction between two parties the\nparticipant and the interviewer. In the context of this study\nboth are nurses. Nurse to nurse interviewing has implications\nfor both participant and researcher. The dynamics of this\ninteraction requires careful consideration and management\nof selection, relationship, and implementation to protect par-\nticipant and interviewer and preserve the integrity of the\ninterview. A factor that differentiates phenomenology from\nother research methods is that it does not necessarily seek to\ncritique findings within a gender-balanced group or a socially\nhomogeneous group but recognizes that it is the explanation\nof participants' stories as they make sense of a life experi-\nence that is important (van Manen, 1990). Although it may\nbe necessary to set some guidelines to focus the research,\ncare should be taken not to narrow the selection criteria of\nparticipants as this may constrict or simplify the research\nphenomenon (Cohen, Kahn, & Steeves, 2000). Participants\nwho have shared the same life experience but have dissimilar\ncircumstances may have different insights, and the diversity\nof these data can provide a broader platform to understand\nthe phenomenon (Polkinghorne, 2005). There are three non-\nnegotiable selection criteria when considering who will be\ninvited to join the participant group: that the participant has\nactually lived the life event that is being researched (van\nManen, 1990), that they agree to share those experiences,\nand that they are able to commit to the time demands of the\nresearch.\nThe focus of Heideggerian phenomenology is to explore\nour human way of Being-in-the-world and how we as humans\nreflect and make sense of Being-in-the-world; Heidegger\n\"The answer to the question of the `who' of everyday Dasein\nis to be obtained by analysing that kind of Being in which\nDasein maintains itself proximally and for the most part\"\nthe crucial task for interviewing within a phenomenological\nstudy is to determine the world that is being researched and\nto interview the participant when they are in that world.\nSpecifying the exact life event that is to be studied can take\nconsiderable time and thought, experienced researchers\nadvise that the development of criteria for purposive sam-\npling should be clearly identified (Faugier & Sargeant, 1996;\nTo facilitate effective recruitment in our study, the partici-\npant group was composed of registered nurses, in recogni-\ntion of their knowledge base and professional role in\nplanning, coordinating, and evaluating delivery of care. As\nan indicator of recency, participants needed to have fulfilled\nthe NFC role in the previous 5 years. There was no expecta-\ntion that participants resided with their family member, but\nthe lead researcher confirmed that the role of carer was a\nconstant and continuing responsibility. Finally, participants\nwere required to have held their role for a minimum period of\n12 months, and this was set in order to capture the depth and\nvariation of experiences occurring and recurring in disease\nprocesses that have cyclical or progressive courses. These\ndeterminants were used to establish the participant group and\nidentify the everyday Dasein that was to become the focus of\nthe study.\nAnother key element of building a sound foundation for\ndata collection is using an effective recruitment strategy\nRecruitment of participants in this study was achieved\nthrough the process of snowballing, a method that uses an\ninformal referral process between colleagues and friends to\nconnect interested parties to the research (Noy, 2008). One\nrationale for using this strategy was that NFCs often elect to\nhave a low profile and can fulfill this role without disclosing\nconsequence, their role as a carer can be invisible to any but\nclose colleagues, and in such circumstances, snowballing\nQuinney et al. 3\nmay be the only effective strategy to reach potential partici-\npants who fulfill the dual role of being both a professional\nnurse and a family carer (Faugier & Sargeant, 1996; Noy,\nNurse to nurse relationships can exist within a wide range\nof associations from one of friendship to supervisor\u00adjunior\nto unknown colleague (McConnell-Henry et al., 2010). Upon\nhearing about the project, some colleagues, who were friends,\noffered to participate in the project. There was an awareness\nthat the ethical recruitment process needed to address any\nperception of pressure or coercion (McDermid et al., 2014).\nCare was taken not to place any pressure or expectation on\ncolleagues to participate, and it was stressed that involve-\nment was voluntary, and an option to withdraw was made\navailable. Pre-existing relationships can lessen the time\ntaken to build rapport and enable the interview to move\nquickly toward a shared dialogue of experiences (McConnell-\nHenry et al., 2010). However, the levels of trust in an estab-\nlished friendship or work relationship may result in the\nparticipant revealing more than they had intended or provid-\ning information they may later regret (Kvale, 2006).\nWhen interviewing participants from pre-existing relation-\nships or from a group that the researcher belongs to, the inter-\nviewer has a status of being an insider (Corbin Dwyer &\ninterviews undertaken in this study had a level of commonal-\nity; some participants were colleagues and some participants\nwere previously unknown to the research team, but like the\ninterviewer, all participants shared the experience of being a\nnurse and of being an NFC. In the nuances, pauses, and idi-\nomatic sayings of the participants'everyday speech, a consid-\nerable level of intent and meaning can be hidden (van Manen,\n1990). Nursing has language that has particular acronyms and\nspeech patterns that represent the everyday communication\nfor the profession. Participants would easily slip into the lan-\nguage of their everyday. The professional Dasein of the par-\nticipants and of the researcher was both nursing and of being\na family carer, and in that shared world, there was a connec-\ntion or as Heidegger expressed it a \"Being-there-too.\"\nThis Being-there-too (Auch-dasein) with them does not have the\nontological character of a Being-present-at-hand-along-\"with\"\nthem within a world. This \"with\" is something of the character\nof \"Dasein\"; the \"too\" means a sameness of Being as\ncircumspectively concernful Being-in-the-world. (Heidegger,\nThe connectedness of Auch-dasein cultivated a level of\ntrust that facilitated the interview process. Trust and rapport\nare necessary to build the relationship between participant\nand the interviewer to an immersion phase where there is a\ndeep level of participation (Di Ciccio-Bloom & Crabtree,\n2006). The shared language and experience of nursing is a\ncombination that can promote understanding and create a\nlink of trust between participant and interviewer.\nThe Where\nThe question of where to hold an interview with peers at first\nseems to have only practical considerations: somewhere\nquiet to allow the conversation to be taped, somewhere pri-\nvate to preserve confidentiality and promote trust, some-\nwhere comfortable so the participant and interviewer can\nconcentrate on the story, and a place that is not intimidating\nso that the participant feels secure (Bryman, 2008;\nLiamputtong, 2009). These are pragmatic considerations\nwith considerable impacts on the ability of the participant to\nrelax and develop trust with the interviewer and the inter-\nview process (Di Ciccio-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006).\nIssues of location can be easily overcome but do not\naddress the powerful forces of felt-space on the interactions\nand responses at interview. The dimensions of felt-space as\ndescribed by Merleau-Ponty are not restricted to mere cubic\nmeters or closed doors but have spiritual, personal, and social\nimplications for those present (Sadala & Adorna, 2002). The\nphysicality of our situation or \"space\" can affect behavior\nand responses at both conscious and subconscious levels\n(van Manen, 1990). The sacred tones of a church or temple\nmay prompt or inhibit social behaviors that are in contrast to\nthose initiated within the invigorating atmosphere of a sports\narena. Moreover, the site chosen for the interview has the\npotential to shift the power dynamic within the interview.\nDifferent locations may shift dominance from the participant\nto the researcher and vice versa (Elwood & Martin, 2000).\nFor example, an interview held in a hospital ward where the\nparticipant is an expert staff member but the interviewer is in\nunfamiliar surroundings will assert a different authority and\ndirection to the exchange than a neutral setting where the\npower balance may be more equal. A startling illustration of\nthis impact was made during the initial interviews. In the\nearly stages of data collection, the lead researcher (L.Q.)\nagreed to requests from participants for interviews to be con-\nducted at their place of work. At a purely practical level, the\nworkplace provided a convenient and central location and so\nit was agreed to meet at an inner city hospital. The interviews\nwere organized to be held in a non-clinical room, and consid-\nerations of privacy, quiet and the allowance of ample time\nwere taken into account. However, the workplaces presented\nunforeseen obstacles: The participants were still in uniform\nand \"at work,\" and within that professional mindset, it was\ndifficult to gain information about their personal experi-\nences. Responses to open questions were clipped, jargon-\nized, and disconnected from the participants' experiences.\nExploration of personal experiences was sparse, while\ndetailed information on pathophysiology and treatment was\nfreely given. The interviews reflected the efficient format of\na clinical handover, but the focus of the research was not\ngathering clinical data. Rather, it was aimed at exploring the\nexperiences of being both a family member and a nurse when\ncaring for a chronically sick relative, and this information\nwas either lacking or provided in a lean and meager outline.\n4 SAGE Open\nAs the interviews were coming to a close, the interviewer\nnoted a sense of distraction and time-urgency as professional\nresponsibilities resumed priority for the participant. The\nresearcher found there was a need to intervene and direct the\ninterview more frequently than usual to guide the conversa-\ntion back to exploring the lived experience. This was in sharp\ncontrast to interviews completed in people's homes, where\nparticipants appeared more relaxed and in control of the pro-\ncess of the interview. There was a difference in tone, lan-\nguage, and emphasis in the participant responses from\ninterviews that were held in clinical workplace settings,\ncompared with those held in neutral or home environments.\nThere was a consistency in the differences between \"at work\"\ninterviews and \"home\" or \"neutral\" interviews. van Manen\n(1990) recognized the influence of \"lived space\" and\ndescribed it as a \"category for inquiring into the ways we\nexperience the affairs of our day to day existence\" (p. 103).\nOne of the factors of a nurse's day-to-day existence is the\nimpact of being \"in uniform\" on language, demeanor, and\noutlook (Shaw & Timmons, 2010). Outcomes from research\nstudies indicate that uniform can influence the level of confi-\ndence and self-esteem of the professional nurse and can set\nboth personal and public expectations of behavior (Shaw &\nprovides delineation between professional roles and personal\nroles; donning a uniform has a powerful connection with\nassuming the role of a health professional, and conversely\nremoving uniform allows the nurse to step away from that\nrole and resume his or her personal responsibilities (Pearson,\nExploring the dynamics of the dual role of the NFC is an\nessential part of the research, and conducting interviews at\nparticipants' places of work, while they were in uniform,\nseemed to distance the participants from their experiences as\nNFCs. The work environment placed participants in a differ-\nent role from the one being researched and may have imposed\nimplicit and deeply engrained professional standards of com-\nmunication and behavior. The uniform and the professional\npersona inextricably attached to the participants did not\nallow the researcher to tap into the life experience being\nexamined. Of interest, Walker (2011) also found that place\nand space were controllable variables during interview and\nin her study on family-witnessed cardio-pulmonary resusci-\ntation. Workplace interviews brought the responses into con-\ntext, whereas the more emotionally charged interviews were\nheld in the home. On reflection, interviewing the participants\nat their place of work and in uniform was counterproduc-\ntive; it set conflicting expectations and impeded the collec-\ntion of rich thick data. The research team has since avoided\nusing interview venues that alter the dynamics of the partici-\npants' role and ensured that the venue was not work related,\nthe participants were not in uniform, and they were not\nabout to commence or had not recently finished work.\nVenues that shifted the position of power and authority\nsuch as the lead researcher's workplace were also avoided.\nIt is recommended that ensuring a neutral environment is\nintegral to providing safe and ethical research (Kvale &\nBrinkmann, 2009). The role of the participant, the language\nthey used, and levels of trust and rapport are all directly\ninfluenced by the space in which the interview is conducted.\nThe How\nConversational interviewing in a phenomenological study\nrequires the researcher to undertake an examination of their\nown origins, bias, and understandings; to be supportive of\nparticipants; to be open to understanding their experiences;\nand to judiciously share experiences and reciprocate with\nparticipants through a dialogical interview process (Corbin\nimportance of understanding our origins or \"historicality\"\nand \"situatedness\" as being primary to developing under-\nstanding of others (Heidegger, 1962). The innumerable frag-\nments of our personal background--birthplace, childhood,\nschooling, cultural background, profession--will form our\nparticular understanding of the world. Within Heideggerian\nphilosophy, reflexivity is performed to raise awareness of the\nresearcher's life perspective rather than as a means to bracket\nthese understandings aside (Dowling, 2007). Reflexivity\ninvolves the researcher turning their attention inwardly to\nacknowledge and explore personal assumptions, prejudices,\nand bias to stimulate understanding of how these may impact\non the research (Clancy, 2013). In addition, reflexivity\nenhances awareness of ethical issues inherent in conducting\nresearch into deeply sensitive and personal matters, and as a\ndirect consequence of this awareness, the researcher is able\nto protect the participants from unnecessary harm (Gullemin\nProviding support for participants prior to data collection\nthrough the distribution of information sheets and consent\nforms is accepted as a requirement prior to any data collec-\ntion. Additional to these stock standards, a phenomenologi-\ncal study might include an explanation to participants of the\ntype of information researchers are seeking from them. To\ncapture the essence of the person's Dasein researchers need\nto acknowledge that they value the everydayness of the par-\nticipants' lived experience, so participants were asked to\ndescribe the experience as they lived it. Researchers advised\nparticipants that they valued what others might not see as\nimportant, the emotions and perceptions that were important\nto the participant. Participants were encouraged to use anec-\ndotes that portrayed the intensity of the lived experience and\nwere asked to simply relate their experience of being an NFC\nin as much detail as they were comfortable with. It is in the\nminutiae of emotions, smells, and sounds that understanding\nof the intensity and complexity of the experience can be\nfound (van Manen, 1990). The provision of background\ninformation and expectations of the research provided a\nshared purpose between the participant and the researcher.\nProviding support for participants was necessary to establish\nQuinney et al. 5\na trust relationship and so enable the very purpose of the phe-\nnomenological study: that is to understand and explore the\nessence of a human experience and to develop a conversa-\ntional partnership with the participant that will reveal the\nmeaning of that experience (van Manen, 1990).\nIt was not uncommon that prior to the interview starting,\nthe participant would initiate a social conversation about\nshared places of work, shared collegial relationships, and\nshared experiences. Most often, the conversation lapsed\nquickly into the everyday language of nursing, full of acro-\nnyms that would be unintelligible to a non-nurse and humor\nthat might be confronting to a non-nurse. This often-short\ninteraction held the beginning of the development of rapport\nand trust. The sharing of carefully selected stories from the\nexperience of the interviewer can reduce the power differen-\ntial, establish authenticity and build trust, enabling the inter-\nview relationship to move quickly from tentative introduction\ninto a phase of immersion in rich data (Dickson-Swift,\nJames, Kippen, & Liamputtong, 2006). Corbin Dwyer and\nBuckle (2009) framed this attitude as \"You are one of us and\nit us versus them (those that do not understand)\" (p. 58).\nConversational interviews generally begin with a \"grand\ntour question.\" The broad nature of the starting point provides\nthe participant with the scope to reveal the details of their\nexperiences according to their priority and personal signifi-\ncance (Spradley, 1979). The interviewer guides the progress\nof the interview through the judicious use of prompts and\nunscripted questioning to clarify and confirm understanding\nwithin a natural dialogue between two people (Roberston-\nMalt, 1999; Smythe, Ironside, Sims, Swenson, & Spence,\n2008). Conversational interviews proceed with minimal\nintervention, so the interaction is significantly less directive\nthan structured and semi-structured interviews (Corbin &\nMorse, 2003). The interviewer is intent on listening to what-\never the participant says as opposed to directing and control-\nling the exchange and is not only open to but adopts a\nwillingness to allow the participant to steer the conversation\nthere is a greater potential for discovery as the interviewees\nmay reveal insights and experiences that the researcher had\nnot predicted (Curry, Nembard, & Bradley, 2009).\nThe phenomenological conversation with peers requires\nthe researcher to adopt a stance of openness to the unex-\npected (Smythe et al., 2008). Within this study, participants\nbrought new insights and new opinions that had been gath-\nered from different vantage points. The understandings and\nperceptions of the participants contributed to a significant\nrepository of data that could be used to build a composite\nunderstanding of the phenomenon of being an NFC of a fam-\nily member during acute exacerbations of a chronic disease.\nEven though as a researcher who had lived a similar experi-\nence, some of the stories held resonance for the lead\nresearcher and there were opportunities to share stories.\nSharing stories can be a way of enhancing reciprocity, lev-\neling the participant/researcher power balance and being open\nand honest about the lead researcher's \"insider\" status\n(Hayman, Wilkes, Jackson, & Halcomb, 2011). However, it is\nimportant to recognize that having \"insider\" status holds risks\nto the integrity of the interview. The participant may assume\nthat the researcher understands the concept that they are\nspeaking of and not go into depth about it.Alternatively, there\nis the danger that a researcher may misinterpret the language\nof the participant and place their own meaning onto their\nwords (Corbin Dwyer & Buckle, 2009). It is important to\nverify the intended meaning with the participant as the inter-\nview progresses so that the essence of the participants'experi-\nence is captured. In addition, caution should be exercised on\nbehalf of the interviewing researcher regarding the extent of\nsharing stories and self-disclosure as there are significant\nrisks in this approach. Providing detailed information that has\nan overlay of opinions and researcher bias may influence the\ndirection and emphasis of the stories provided by the partici-\npant, thereby skewing the data (Brannick & Coghlan, 2007).\nOver disclosure may hold risks for the researcher as the par-\nticipant is not bound by principles of confidentiality and\ninformation about the researcher could be used outside the\ninterview (Hayman et al., 2011; McConnell-Henry et al.,\n2010). The advantage to being a member of this particular\ngroup provided a commonality that allowed a more immedi-\nate acceptance and level of trust (Corbin Dwyer & Buckle,\n2009). It also provided the lead researcher with fluency in the\neveryday language of being a nurse and of being an NFC.\nNurses who are also researchers have dual roles, primar-\nily as a researcher but also as a nurse with an obligation to\nthe professional standards and duty of care. The duality of\nprofessional roles and researcher roles can result in role con-\nflict (Polkinghorne, 2005). Frequently, there were emotional\nresponses from participants as they told extremely personal\nstories of loss, burden, and frustration. The automatic caring\nresponse from a nurse is to reach out to offer comfort, but\nethical boundaries of research requires the interviewer to\nremain in the role of researcher (Asselin, 2003; McConnell-\nHenry et al., 2010). There is a clear distinction between the\nrole of researcher, which is to obtain information, and the\naim of the nurse, which is to provide comfort. To avoid role\nconflict or confusion, the interviewer followed the well-\nestablished precedent of clarifying that their role was one of\na researcher and to maintain the stance of researcher in lan-\nguage and attitude. Also in line with common practice, the\navailability of a qualified counselor was made explicit\n2005). However, when faced with the circumstances of dis-\ntressed participants describing difficult and sensitive life\nexperiences, there was inevitably empathy and deep connect-\nedness. In the intensity of those moments, the transcripts\nshow long silences, and the researcher felt a sense of pro-\nfound and shared togetherness. Corbin and Morse (2003)\nadvised researchers to recognize the emotional sharing of\nfeelings but be able to step back and focus on providing the\nsupport that the participant might need.\n6 SAGE Open\nRecommendations for Applied\nPhenomenology\nThe proposed framework is not offered as a definitive frame-\nwork for phenomenological research but rather as a useful\nstarting point for reflection. At the heart of the proposal is a\nrecommendation that the quality of data collection will be\nimproved by adherence to the philosophical underpinnings\nof phenomenology, and organizing interviews so that the\nparticipant is able to develop a trust relationship with the\ninterviewer and is able to access the role, language, and\nspace that is reflected in the research question. Employing\nthese strategies may deepen and enrich data collection and\nmay align the process of data collection with the research\nmethodology. Within the framework depicted in Figure 1,\nthere are four overlapping considerations of space, language,\nrole, and trust that impact on the quality of dialogue in the\nconversational interview. These elements are interdependent\nand can have positive and negative influences on the suc-\ncessful conduction of a peer interview. The authors suggest\nthat when conflicting considerations are removed, there is a\nclearing for the interviewer and interviewee to meet and\nexplore a shared dialogue. The successful conversational\ninterview is situated within this uncluttered central space that\nhas had encumbrances, hindrances, and deviators removed.\nIt is here that the essence of the phenomenon for each partici-\npant can be uncovered and the Dasein of the participant be\nrevealed. The proposed framework mirrors the concepts of\n\"Who, Where and How\" and may be useful as a structure to\nuse when planning data collection within a phenomenologi-\ncal methodology.\nHeidegger highlights interpretation of the richness of\neveryday experiences as the conduit to understanding \"Being-\nin-the-world.\" For researchers, this fundamental principle\nguides all aspects of the research method including data col-\nlection. To apply a hermeneutic research approach to the phe-\nnomenon, it is essential that participants are enabled to provide\nvivid, rich, and authentic accounts of their experiences. The\nauthors discuss how management of \"space, language, role,\nand trust,\" can reduce tension and barriers for the participant\nand clear a passage to access the experiences of everyday.\nIssues of Space\nThe relationship between the physical space we are in and\nourselves can influence our perceptions and our interpreta-\nforms and forges our understanding and can have consider-\nable power on expression, personal interaction, and commu-\nnication. Heidegger suggests that there is an ontological link\nto our way of being and the space we are in, \"but inasmuch\nas any entity within-the-world is likewise in space, its spati-\nality will have an ontological connection to the world.

When the\ninterview is situated in a space that allows the participant to\nremain in the role that is consistent with the research focus,\nthe participant is enabled to respond to the questions authen-\ntically in that role. To place the person in an alternative envi-\nronment may cause a level of confusion or role conflict that\nFigure1. Data Collection Framework for Phenomenology.\nNote. When distracters that cause role confusion or present conflicting\nexpectations are able to impact on the participant the interview can\nproduce diluted and meager data. To facilitate participants to access the\nspecific experiences of the research, extraneous influences should be\nremoved or minimized from the interview environment, and positive\nand authentic influences should be sought to augment access of genuine\nthick, rich data. In this study, researchers have identified factors of \"space,\nlanguage, role, and trust\" for consideration; however, the factors that\nlimit or potentiate accessing thick rich data will be defined by the context\nof the study and will not be limited to those described here.\nQuinney et al. 7\ncreates unnecessary barriers to the collection of rich thick\nIssues of Language\nCultivating the optimal environment for peer interviewing\nbetween a nurse researcher and an NFC presented a tension\nbetween allowing the language of nursing to cultivate a level\nof trust and not allowing the language of nursing to divert the\ninterview into a clinical report. Language within nursing has\ntraditionally not been an avenue for subjective contempla-\ntion but rather a means to objectively convey details between\nhealth professionals using minimal extraneous or emotive\ninformation (Finnegan, Marshall, & Flanagan, 2010). It is\nsuggested that language changes as participants move from\none role to another. Traditions and historicity of language\nreflects the world it refers to (Walsh, 2010). When in the\nspace of a nurse and in the role of a nurse, the traditions of\nnursing will be reflected in the language that is used.\nConsequently, the language and story that is the focus of\nthe study may be missing if the participant is situated in a\nrole, or a way of Being-in-the-world, which has a tradition of\ndiscouraging one sort of language perhaps that of subjective,\nemotive language and encouraging a different sort of lan-\nguage perhaps that of clinical abbreviations. \"Language is\nnot identical with the sum total of all the words printed in a\ndictionary; instead language is as Dasein is . . . it exists\"\nof making our interpretations of the world manifest to others:\na way of recognizing and pointing out events and experi-\nences that are of particular significance to Dasein (Dreyfus,\n1991). Language obtains meaning from the world we dwell\nin, which is influenced by the role and space we occupy.\nThe considerations of space and role are clearly interde-\npendent and have some influence upon the language with\nwhich the participant's story is relayed. Professional roles\nplace significant expectations on demeanor and language. It\nwas found that although the NFC would use the language of\nnursing in their home to expedite understanding with another\nhealth professional, the tone of the delivery was very differ-\nent from the abbreviated and objective reports of interviews\nheld in a workplace. When the participants were interviewed\nat home, they relayed stories that were full of emotion, rich\nin description and highlighted by anecdotes that enabled the\nresearchers to connect to the participant's stories.\nFamiliarity with the everyday language of the participant\ncan allow the interviewer access to a huge reservoir of mean-\ning that might be lost on someone who is not familiar with\nthat language (van Manen, 1990). The specifics of a shared\nlanguage are in itself a way of Being-in-the-world and for the\nparticipants and interviewer can be opportunity to explore\nthe Dasein of nursing and of being an NFC.\nThe way in which discourse gets expressed is language.\nLanguage is a totality of words--a totality in which discourse\nhas a \"worldly\" Being of its own; and as an entity within-the-\nworld, this totality thus becomes something which we may come\nIssues of Role\nGathering rich, authentic data is facilitated when the partici-\npant is in the role under inquiry. When interviewing a nurse\nabout clinical matters, it is reasonable to conduct the inter-\nview in a quiet part of the clinical environment. When con-\nducting interviews about family carers, careful planning and\nplacement of the interview will allow the participant to more\nfully access the memories and lived experiences that are\nbeing researched. Aspects of the participant's role, which\nmay be determined by role, space, and language among other\nfactors, are important considerations when arranging phe-\nnomenological interviews to ensure the data are both rich\nand genuine and that the essence of the phenomena is brought\nforward. Heidegger directs us to observe the essential ele-\nments of the person's everyday Dasein. \"The answer to the\n`who' of everyday Dasein is to be obtained by analysing that\nkind of Being in which Dasein maintains itself proximally\nIn addition, role conflict has been identified as an ever-\npresent risk for nurse researchers (Asselin, 2003; McConnell-\nHenry et al., 2010). In situations where there are sensitive\nand emotive issues or issues where standards of care are not\nmet, there is a danger that the nurse researcher can disregard\ntheir role as a researcher and respond as a health provider or\nas a nurse counselor. When interviewing participants who\nare also colleagues and/or friends, there can be a blurring of\nroles and the shift between friend/colleague to researcher and\nback again can be difficult (Taylor, 2011). The participant\nmay be aware that the researcher/friend now has new insights\ninto deeply personal and sensitive aspects of their life world\nand reassurance about the integrity of the researcher needs to\nbe both voiced and actioned (Karnieli-Miller, Strier, &\nPessach, 2009). Pre-existing friendships may result in an\nassumption on the part of the interviewer that they already\nunderstand the perspective of the participant, thereby blur-\nring the perception and interpretation of the data provided by\nparticipants (Taylor, 2011). Nurse researchers conducting\nresearch that involve participants who have a pre-existing\nrelationship need to be aware of potential conflict and to pro-\nactively manage issues of trust through reflexivity and reci-\nprocity and so that role conflict is minimized.\nIssues of Trust\nEstablishment of a relationship that has a basis of trust is\nfundamental to achieving the desired outcomes for both\ninterviewer and interviewee. Facilitation of trust in the par-\nticipant\u00adresearcher relationship begins in the interactions\nprior to the actual interview and continues throughout.\nNurturing this initial and fragile stage of establishing trust\n8 SAGE Open\nrequires time and attention to the nuances within the shared\ncontribute to nurturing trust include providing a safe private\nspace so that the participant feels comfortable and confident\nwhen speaking about very personal aspects of their life.\nThe term conversational interview intimates that there is\nreciprocity and dialogue between the participant and the\nresearcher. Transition into dialogue that provides rich and\nthick data can be achieved more quickly when a common\nand shared language releases the participant from the need to\ninterpret or alter their speech patterns for the interviewer.\nThe participant is able to relax into the speech of their every-\nday, \"what is said-in-the talk, as such; the communication;\nand the making known. These are not properties which can\nbe just raked up empirically from language. They are exis-\ntential characteristics rooted in the state of Dasein's being\"\n(Heidegger, 1962). Following on from this, trust can emerge\nquickly when the participant and researcher have a level of\ncommon understanding from being members of a group with\nsimilar but different life experiences (Corbin Dwyer &\nBuckle, 2009). Heidegger provides a phenomenological con-\ntext for this\nThis Dasein-with of the Others is disclosed within-the-world for\na Dasein, and so too for those who are Dasein with us (die\nMitdaseienden), only because Dasein in itself is essentially\nBeing-with. The phenomenological assertion that \"Dasein is\nessentially Being-with\" has an existential\u00adontological meaning.\nThe amount of time required and the degree of nurturing\nto establish trust is unique; there is no time schedule to\nachieve a perfect interview. However, during the interview\nopportunities exist to establish a reciprocal relationship that\nis grounded in dialogue and can potentiate a positive experi-\nence for both the participant and the interviewer (Kvale &\nBrinkmann, 2009). Mutual respect and trust enables the\ninterview to transcend the superficial and provide deep rich\ndata for the purpose of the research. Recognizing the crucial\nsignificance of the quality of the relationship imposes\nresponsibilities upon the interviewer to make provisions for\nthe needs of the participant while remaining true to the pur-\npose of the dialogue, which is to explore the lived experience\nand describe the essences of that experience.\nConclusion\nThe dual role held by NFC's may well provide them with\npowerful insights and important perspectives that are not\navailable to other health care workers. The lack of research\nin this area represents a lost opportunity to inform the prac-\ntices of health care and improve outcomes for all people who\nare chronically ill. Conducting conversational interviews\nwith this group of participants presents the challenge to peer\nresearchers to glean data consistent with a Heideggerian\nhermeneutic study and respect the gift of the participant's\nstories. Issues of space, language, role, and trust were identi-\nfied as crucial in achieving an interview environment which\nprovided NFC's with an opportunity to voice their lived\nexperiences. The article reinforces the development of a trust\nrelationship to enrich the experience for both participant and\ninterviewer. Practical examples of how contextualizing the\nresearch question from the standpoint of the participant and\nproviding an authentic space which reflects the contribution\nof the participant can enhance the interview process have\nbeen provided.\nHeidegger celebrated the facticity of our lives and opposed\nthe Cartesian approach of reducing our lived experiences to\nsurface qualities (Harman, 2007). The framework that has\nbeen offered has been explicated through the philosophies of\nHeideggerian hermeneutics and provides a platform to dis-\ncuss the dearth of methodical direction associated with\nHermeneutic Phenomenology. It is incumbent upon research-\ners working within a Heideggerian construct to align meth-\nodology with the philosophy of phenomenology.\n"
