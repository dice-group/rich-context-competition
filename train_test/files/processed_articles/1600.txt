Blacks have the high-\nest cancer incidence rates: They are about\n60% more likely to develop cancer than\nare Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders\nand more than twice as likely to develop\ncancer as American Indians. Between\namong whites (-1.2% per year), Hispan-\nics (-1.7% per year), and American Indi-\nans (-0.7% per year), and remained rela-\ntively stable among blacks and Asian/\nPacific Islanders.3\nWhite women are more likely to de-\nvelop breast cancer than are women of\nother racial and ethnic groups, and black\nwomen are more likely to develop can-\ncers of the colon and rectum.3 Black men\nhave the highest incidence rates for can-\ncers of the colon and rectum, lung and\nbronchus, and prostate. They are also at\nleast 50% more likely to develop prostate\ncancer than men of other racial and eth-\nnic groups.\nBlacks are about 33% more likely\nto die of cancer than are whites, and\nmore than twice as likely to die of cancer\nas are Asian/Pacific Islanders, American\nand 1996, mortality rates decreased sig-\nnificantly among whites (-0.5% per\nyear), blacks (-0.9% per year), and His-\npanics (-0.6% per year); remained rela-\ntively stable among Asian/Pacific Is-\nlanders; and may be increasing among\nAmerican Indians.3\nBlack women are more likely to die\nof breast (see article by Dignam in this is-\nsue of CA, page 50) and colon and rectum\ncancers than are women of any other\nracial or ethnic group, and they have ap-\nproximately the same lung and bronchus\ncancer death rate as white women. As\nwas seen with incidence rates, black men\nhave the highest mortality rates of colon\nand rectum, lung and bronchus, and\nprostate cancers.3\nCancer is the second leading cause of\ndeath among children between one and 14\nyears of age in the US; accidents are the\nmost frequent cause of death in this age\ngroup (Table 12). The most commonly\noccurring cancers in children are leu-\nkemias (in particular, acute lymphocytic\nleukemia), tumors of the central and sym-\npathetic nervous systems, lymphomas,\nsoft-tissue sarcomas, and renal tumors.3\nOver the past 20 years, there have been\nsignificant improvements in the five-year\nrelative survival rate for many childhood\ncancers, especially acute lymphocytic and\nacute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's\nlymphoma, and Wilms' Tumor (Table 13).\nyear relative survival rates for childhood\ncancers at all sites combined improved\nLimitations and Future Challenges\nOur estimates of the expected numbers of\nnew cancer cases and cancer deaths\nshould be interpreted with caution when\ntracking trends over time. These estimates\nmay vary considerably from year to year,\nparticularly for rare cancers and for states\nwith smaller populations. We therefore\ndiscourage the use of these estimates to\ntrack year-to-year changes in cancer oc-\ncurrence and death. The recorded num-\nber of cancer deaths and cancer death\nrates from the National Center for Health\nStatistics, and SEER cancer incidence\nrates are generally more informative sta-\ntistics for the purpose of tracking cancer\ntrends. For example, breast cancer inci-\ndence rates increased about 1% per year\n1996. Despite the stabilization of inci-\ndence rates during the latter time period,\nthe estimates of new breast cancer cases\nOur estimates are based on the most\ncurrently available cancer mortality and\nincidence data; however, these data are\nthree and four years old, respectively, at\nthe time that the estimates are calculated.\nAs such, the effects of large changes oc-\ncurring in the three- or four-year interval\ncaptured by our modeling efforts. Finally,\nour estimates of new cancer cases are\nbased on incidence rates for the geo-\ngraphic locations that participate in the\nSEER program and, therefore, may not\nbe representative of the total US.\nDespite these limitations, our esti-\nmates do describe current patterns of\ncancer incidence and mortality in the\nUS. Such estimates will assist our con-\ntinuing efforts to reduce the public\nhealth burden of cancer as we enter the\nReferences\n1. National Cancer Institute: SEER Cancer\n1998 Submission.
