Previous research on differences between Black and White older adults has produced inconsistent results\non whether a gap in disability exists and whether it persists over time. The present research identifies several reasons for\nthe inconsistent results to date and examines Black/White differences in disability trajectories over 6 years.\nMethods. Data from the North Carolina Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (1986\u00ad\n1992) are used to estimate the disability gap and trajectory over time for both Black and White older adults.\nResults. Results indicate that a disability gap between Black and White adults exists, but after socioeconomic\nresources, social integration, and other health indicators are adjusted for, the trajectories of disability by race are not\nsignificantly different. Controlling for incident morbidity over time accounts for the significant difference in level of\ndisability between the two groups.\nDiscussion. This research supports the ``persistent inequality'' interpretation, indicating that Black adults have higher\nmorbidity and disability earlier in life compared with White adults, and that the gap neither converges nor diverges over\ntime.\nSOCIOLOGICAL, epidemiologic, and clinical research has\nconsistently shown that there is a glaring difference in\nhealth between White and Black Americans. Black adults\nhave consistently poorer health, fewer visits to a doctor, and\nhigher mortality rates for a wide range of conditions (Clark &\nlikely to have longer hospital stays and more days sick in bed\nthan White Americans (Liao, McGee, Cao, & Cooper, 1999). In\naddition, Black adults are at higher risk for most types of\ncancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke than their\nWhite counterparts (Manton & Stallard, 1997).\nThe evidence regarding racial differences in disability dur-\ning later life, however, has been less clear. A number of\nstudies have shown that Black older adults have much poorer\nphysical functioning than White older adults, indicating that a\ndisability gap exists (Clark & Maddox, 1992; Ferraro, Farmer,\n& Wybraniec, 1997; Ostchega, Harris, Hirsch, Parsons, &\nresearch shows that the disability gap increases over time\nthe gap decreases and even converges among the oldest old\nMendes de Leon et al., 1997). The disability gap goes beyond\nconvergence in the later years, some argue, such that a ``disabil-\nity crossover'' emerges around age 80, at which point surviving\nBlack adults have better physical functioning than their\nGiven the inconsistency in the results to date, further\nresearch is needed to clarify whether aging amplifies, reduces,\nor maintains earlier inequalities. The purpose of this article is to\nidentify reasons for the inconsistent results and examine Black/\nWhite differences in disability trajectories over time.\n \nWhy the Inconsistent Results?\nTo better understand the inconsistent results, we find it\nimportant to note that there are theoretical or conceptual frame-\nworks that support either amplification or reduction of the\ngap. Most of the research pointing to a widening of the dis-\nability gap in later life is premised upon a cumulative disad-\nvantage perspective (Dannefer, 1987). It is widely understood\nthat many Black people experience a cascade of disad-\nvantages from birth to later life. Many of these disadvantages\nare related to economic inequality, but they are interwoven in\nother systems of stratification. Cumulative disadvantage theory\nholds that there are enduring effects of these early experi-\nences. People are set on health trajectories as a result of\ndisadvantages experienced across the life course, and the ef-\nfects amplify in later years. Indeed, this idea bears much re-\nsemblance to the double jeopardy hypothesis in studies of\nminority aging, but that hypothesis specifies older adulthood\nitself as a key disadvantage (Bengtson, Burgess, & Parrott,\nIn contrast, convergence of health inequality in later life is\noften seen as a matter of selective survival. Whereas Black\npersons have higher mortality in the early years, a more select\nset of them reaches older ages, when compared with White\npersons. This has also been coupled with hardiness (Williams &\nLawler, 2001) and acquired-immunity hypotheses (Preston,\nHill, & Drevenstedt, 1998), suggesting that older Black persons\nare, to some degree, a survivor elite. Moreover, in sample sur-\nveys, there is the added concern of selective sampling,\nwhereby nonrespondents are more likely to be disadvantaged\n(e.g., physically or cognitively impaired). In short, failure to\nconsider differential racial mortality--and nonrandom selec-\ntion, more generally--may give the appearance of decreasing\nhealth disparities.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nBeyond the conceptual frameworks used, there are several\nsubstantive and methodological issues that may account for the\ninconsistency in the empirical literature. First, race differences in\ndisability among older adults have often been attributed to\ndifferencesinsocioeconomicstatus.Infact,someresearchersfind\nthat the disability gap does notexist--or is greatly reduced--after\nthey account for differences in education and income among\nBlack and White adults (Guralnik, Land, et al., 1993; Liao et al.,\nHammond, 1993). However, not all findings are consistent with\nthis premise, indicating that other risk factors in addition to\nsocioeconomic status contribute to the racial disability gap (Clark\nde Leon et al., 1997). The issue may be which measures of\nsocioeconomic status are considered. The mechanisms linking\nsocioeconomic status to health have been shown to be different\nfor Black and White older adults, underscoring the need for\na multidimensional approach to the measurement of socioeco-\nnomic status (Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997). Many studies\nuse only one or two indicators, typically education, income, or\nalthough important, gives only part of the economic picture\nbecause wealth accumulation is critical to understanding\nconsumption patterns and lifestyle choices of older people.\nOccupational history may also be important for understanding\ndisability because certain types of work are associated with\nphysical demands that may accelerate or prevent disability.\nSecond, morbidity is seen as the key antecedent of disability,\nand specific health conditions such as diabetes, stroke, hip frac-\nture, and heart attack may lead to a sharp increase in disability\n(Guralnik, LaCroix, et al., 1993; Guralnik, LaCroix, Branch,\nscribe it, pathology is the first stage of the disablement process.\nMost of the longitudinal studies examine the effects of initial\nmorbidity on subsequent disability (Clark, 1996; Liao et al.,\nincident morbidity, failure to account for it may lead\ninvestigators to miss an important part of the disablement\nprocess. One study that incorporated change in morbidity found\nthat it was part of an overall spiral of health decline (Ferraro\net al., 1997). Although that investigation made use of a count\nof comorbidity, it may be useful to next consider the effects\nof specific diseases on disability, especially because of the dis-\ntinct morbidity profiles of Black and White older adults.\nThe way previous researchers have treated morbidity,\nsocioeconomic status, and the relationship between them\nmay well account for much of the inconsistency in findings on\nthe Black/White disability gap. Nevertheless, there are two\nmethodological limitations that may add to the inconsistency.\nFirst, much of the research examining Black/White differences\nin disability has been conducted on single-wave samples\nWhite-Means & Hammond, 1993) or panel studies of few or\nSeeman et al., 1994). Morbidity incidence and subsequent\ndisability require time to fully develop and may not be detected\nwhen all measures are collected at the same time point or when\nthe time lag is too short.\nSecond, panel data, especially with three or more waves, are\nexcellent for studying the disablement process, but they also\nentail the complication of attrition. Death, refusal, and loss\nto follow-up could potentially reduce the number of subjects\nat subsequent waves, and attrition is likely to be nonrandom\n(Lillard & Panis, 1998). Black Americans, older adults, less\nhealthy persons, and men have higher mortality rates, in-\ncreasing the likelihood that the remaining sample will be dis-\nproportionately White Americans, younger adults, healthier\npersons, and women (Guralnik, Land, et al., 1993). With few\nexceptions (e.g., Mendes de Leon et al., 1997), previous re-\nsearch on race differences in disability has not accounted for\npotential selection bias that is due to attrition. The likely\nconsequence is that the gap in disability between Black and\nWhite adults over time may be underestimated because the\nremaining sample is younger and healthier.\nThe present research seeks to help resolve the inconsis-\ntency in research findings on the Black/White disability gap\nin later life by addressing the limitations of previous research\nenumerated herein. A fuller, although not comprehensive, set of\nsocioeconomic status (SES) variables is examined. Morbidity,\nincluding incident morbidity over six follow-up periods,\nis considered in studying the disablement process. Disability\ntrajectories are estimated with structural equation models while\naccounting for attrition. The research focuses on three ques-\ntions. First, does a disability gap exist between Black and\nWhite older adults? If yes, two additional questions follow\nlogically. Does the gap widen, shrink (perhaps to the point of\nreversing the gap), or remain stable over time? Does current or\nincident morbidity narrow or account for the racial disparity in\ndisability among older adults? Consistent with the cumulative\ndisadvantage perspective, it is hypothesized that the racial dis-\nability gap exists in later life and will widen over time. It is\nanticipated that race differences in the number of prevalent\nhealth conditions will most likely account for much of the racial\ndisability gap, relative to incident morbidity, but that selected\nhealth conditions that develop during the course of the study\n(e.g., stroke) will heighten disability.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThis research uses data from the North Carolina Established\nPopulations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\n(EPESE). Residents were sampled from five counties in North\nCarolina to reflect urban and rural counties in the Southeast\nUnited States. Baseline data were collected in household\ninterviews in 1986, and six subsequent annual waves were\noversampled so that the final sample of 4,162 adults aged 65\nsample also includes 26 persons who were not classified as Black\nor White. These persons were combined with the White subjects\nin the file that was archived with the Interuniversity Consortium\nfor Political and Social Research. Thus, it is impossible to\nidentify these cases in the publicly available data. Thirty-five\npercent of the sample did not complete all seven waves, leaving\n2,567 respondents at the seventh interview. Of those who did\nnot finish the study, only 129 did not due to refusal or loss to\nfollow-up; the vast majority of attrition was due to death. De-\ntails of the sampling and interviewing procedures can be found\nin the article by Cornoni-Huntley and colleagues (1993).\nMeasurement\nTable 1 contains all of the variables, the coding, means,\nand standard deviations for the total sample and separately for\nBlack and White adults. The dependent variable for these\nanalyses is disability and is based on respondents' reports of\ntheir level of ability to perform seven activities of daily living\n(ADLs): walking, eating, dressing, grooming, transferring to\na chair from the bed, bathing, and using the toilet (Katz, Ford,\nMoskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffee, 1963). There were three\npossible response categories: able to perform the task without\nhelp (0), able to perform the task with some help (1), or unable\nto perform the task independently (2). The questions about\nphysical function at baseline asked participants if they had\ntrouble any time in the preceding 12 months. A follow-up\nquestion asked if the participants still had trouble performing\nthe task. Respondents who needed help in the previous year\nbut did not currently require aid to perform the task were\nconsidered to be independent and were coded as 0. This made\nthe measures at baseline consistent with each of the follow-up\ninterviews, which capture current dependencies only. The re-\nsponses from the seven ADL tasks (within the same wave) were\nthen summed, creating a single measure of disability ranging\nfrom 0, meaning the respondent needed no help in any do-\nmain, to 14, meaning the respondent could not perform any of\nthe tasks independently (a \u00bc .89). This measure is identical\nat all seven waves. There were 86 respondents who were alive\nand interviewed but did not answer the ADL questions at\none or more waves.\nSocioeconomic status is measured with several variables.\nEducation has four categories: 0 to 7 years (1); 8 to 11 years\nincome is measured with five categories ranging from less\nTable 1.

Those who own\ntheir home are coded as 1; all others are coded as 0. Measures\nof employment are also included. Those who were currently\nemployed at baseline are identified in a dichotomous variable\n(1 \u00bc employed; 0 \u00bc not employed). Respondents were also\nasked the primary type of work they performed during their\nyears of employment. Only two were significant in preliminary\nmodels and were therefore retained: professional career and\nlabor career. Both are coded so that 1 equals the name of the\nvariable and 0 is used for all others. The reference group for\nthese analyses includes those who performed primarily retail,\nservice, managerial, or operative work during years of\nemployment.\nSeveral indicators of social integration were included in\nthese analyses. Marital status was identified with two binary\nvariables: married and widowed. In both cases, those with that\nmarital status were coded as 1. All others were coded as 0.\nFrequency of religious service attendance ranged from never\n(1) to more than once a week (6). Total number of living\nchildren ranges from none (0) to five or more (5). Respondents\nwere also asked the following question: ``Other than your\nchildren, how many relatives do you have that you feel close\nto?'' The response categories range from none (0) to 5 or more\n(3). Those who live alone were identified with the value of 1 in\na binary variable. All others were coded as 0.\nSelf-reported depression is measured with a sum of 20\nitems from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression\nScale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Respondents were asked about\ntheir general feelings in the past month, such as whether they\nenjoyed life, had the blues, had restless sleep, or felt people\ndisliked them, with possible responses being ``yes'' (1) or ``no''\n(0). Four items were reverse coded and all 20 items were then\nsummed. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive\nsymptomatology or depressive mood.\nSeveral indicators of health status and behavior, including\nseven existing health conditions, were also measured in these\nanalyses. Respondents were asked if they had ever been told by\nmedical personnel that they had cancer, heart trouble (including\nheart attack), stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, hip fracture,\nor broken bones. Each is coded as 1 if the condition is present\nand 0 if not. Incontinence is measured separately and ranges\nfrom never (1) to all of the time (5). Current smokers and past\nsmokers were each identified with binary variables.\nDemographic variables include being Black, being female,\nand living in a rural area. All three are binary variables, in\nwhich 1 equals the name of the variable. All others are coded as\nAnalysis\nThe first stage of the analysis uses the continuous measures\nof disability at all seven waves to estimate the overall level and\ntrajectory of disability. These trajectories are estimated by using\nlatent growth curves in structural equation models. Individual\nchange in disability is modeled as a function of time and is\nthen used to estimate change in disability for the total sample\nFigure 1 illustrates the proposed measurement model of the\ntrajectory of disability over time. Both of the latent constructs\nhave seven indicators of disability, one at each wave. Level\nis a latent construct of the average level of disability for all\n7 years. Trajectory is a latent construct of the rate of change in\ndisability over time. A nonlinear trajectory, where the paths to\nthe third through seventh wave disability measures are freely\nestimated rather than fixed to a particular value, was tested but\nFigure 1. Conceptual latent growth model of disability over 7 years: North Carolina Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of\nthe Elderly, 1986\u00ad1992. The latent construct for the level has fixed paths to each measure of disability: the value of 1 for the path to disability at each\nwave. The latent construct for the slope has fixed paths for the first two measures of disability, 0 and 1, respectively, to set the metric of the slope\n(McArdle & Hamagami, 1991). Each subsequent disability measure is fixed to a consecutively higher number (2, 3, etc.) to estimate the linear slope.\nwas not a significantly better fit than the linear slope. In the\nfull model, both latent constructs of level and trajectory are\nregressed on baseline exogenous covariates. Key instrumental\nvariables in the models are noted in the tables.\nThe research questions of whether a disability gap exists\nbetween Black and White older adults and what happens to that\ngap over time are tested by estimating a measurement model\nof the disability trajectory for the total sample, with only race,\ngender, and age as exogenous covariates. If a gap does exist,\nfull models are then estimated with socioeconomic resources,\nsocial integration, and morbidity indicators to test whether these\ncovariates account for the racial health disparity. The final stage\nof these analyses is to test the time-varying impact of incident\nmorbidity on disability and determine whether accounting for\nthe temporal effect of this relationship explains the remaining\nracial disability gap. The level and trajectory of disability are\nestimated in the manner described herein, but incident health\nconditions (since the previous wave) are lagged to estimate dis-\nability at the subsequent wave. This provides adjusted estimates\nof disability prior to the calculation of the level and trajectory\nIn this sample of older adults, there is significant attrition.\nEach model is adjusted for nonrandom attrition by using a\nhazard rate instrument based on the inverse Mills ratio ex-\npressing the likelihood of not remaining in the study for all\nseven waves (Heckman, 1979). A probit equation estimates the\nlikelihood of completing all seven waves of the study. Based on\nthat likelihood, an inverse Mills ratio is calculated for each case\nso that high values indicate a strong likelihood of not com-\npleting the study. This variable is entered into the substantive\nThere are several advantages to the latent growth curve\nprocedure for these analyses. First, no assumption about the\nlinearity of the disablement process over time is required, and\nthis is actually tested. Second, it incorporates information from\nall seven waves of data simultaneously in the same model in-\nstead of simply capturing change between end points or consec-\nutive pairs of survey waves. Third, the latent growth curve\nmodels can incorporate time-varying covariates, capturing\nchange that occurred during the study.\nRESULTS\nFor the research questions in this article to be answered, four\nseparate latent growth curve models were estimated. Table 2\ncontains comparisons of model fit across all four models; Tables\n3 and 4 present the estimates of the covariates for each model.\nModel fit across all four models will be compared first, followed\nby a discussion of the covariates in each individual model.\nModel 1 is the basic disability model, with only race, sex,\nand age as exogenous covariates. Model statistics indicate\na fairly good fit. The goodness of fit index and the incremen-\ntal fit index are both .99. The root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA) is .05, which is at the threshold for\nacceptance (Kelloway, 1998). The level, which is .48, is the\nadjusted mean of disability for 7 years. The adjusted slope, .10,\nis the rate of change in disability over time. This means that for\neach year, the average change in disability is an increase of .10.\nModel 2 enters all of the covariates into the model and\nreestimates the level and slope. Model fit improved from\nModel 1. The RMSEA decreased to .01 and the incremental fit\nindex increased to 1.00. The adjusted level of disability slightly\ndecreased, and the slope slightly increased. Model 3 uses a\nmultigroup estimation for Black and White adults, controlling\nfor all of the covariates in Model 2. Model fit is again strong;\nthe RMSEA value is equal to .01 and the goodness of fit index\nfor both groups is .99. Black older adults have a significantly\nhigher level of disability than White older adults, but after the\ncovariates are controlled for, the slope is not significantly\ndifferent by race.\nModel 4 extends the analysis by including incident morbid-\ndegrees of freedom. The incremental fit index is 1.00 and the\nRMSEA is .01. This is an excellent fit, especially for a second-\norder latent growth model because of the addition of another\nlevel of latent variables (Sayer & Cumsille, 2001).\nTable 3 contains the estimates for Models 1, 2, and 3. For\neach latent growth curve model, results presented are the\nestimates of the covariates on the level and slope for disability\nover time. When sex and age are accounted for, Black older\nadults are significantly more likely to have higher levels of\ndisability and steeper slopes over the observation period. This\nmeans that the disability gap does indeed exist, with Black\nolder adults having significantly higher levels of overall\ndisability. In addition, Black older adults have a significantly\nsteeper trajectory of disability, indicating that their levels of\ndisability increase at a faster rate than those of White older\nadults. This provides evidence that the disability gap continues\nto widen over time.\nAs shown in Table 3, Model 2 introduces all of the covari-\nTable 2.

This model also includes\nthe adjustment for nonrandom attrition. The separate sample\nanalysis (Model 3) reveals that when SES and other covariates\nare controlled for, Black older adults are more likely than White\nolder adults to have a higher level of disability (.51 vs. .42) but\nno longer have a significantly steeper slope (.12 vs. .10) than\nWhite adults. This means that Black adults have a higher\naverage level of disability and that the gap persists over\ntime, neither increasing nor decreasing. Other predictors of a\nhigher level of disability are being depressed, being incontinent,\nhaving had a stroke, having high blood pressure, or having a hip\nfracture. A significantly lower level of disability was predicted\nby living in a rural area, being employed at baseline, having had\na labor career, being a homeowner, attending religious services\nmore frequently, not living alone, and being a current smoker.\nThe trajectory or slope of disability over time is higher for\nolder adults, those with diabetes at baseline, those who live in\na rural area, and those who did not have a professional career.\nThe slope of disability was also significantly predicted by the\nhazard rate variable for attrition. The relationship was positive,\nindicating that persons who were at the highest risk of attrition\nhad steeper disability slopes. In short, disability estimates in\npanel data without an adjustment for nonrandom attrition likely\nunderestimate true health disparities.\nModel 3 estimates the level and slope of disability separately\nfor Black and White adults, using the multigroup method in\nLISREL 8.5. Both groups share many of the same predictors of\nthe level and slope of disability. Current employment, frequent\nattendance at religious services, and current smoking at base-\nline predict lower levels of overall disability. Being depressed,\nbeing incontinent, and having had a stroke or a hip fracture are\npredictive of higher levels of overall disability for both Black\nand White adults. The trajectory of disability over time is\nhigher among the oldest Black and White adults, those who\nare not married, and those with diabetes.\nSeveral covariates, however, are not consistent across race\ngroups. Even though the relationships were significant for one\nTable 3.

Additionally, the protective effect of living in\na rural area holds for Black older adults only; living in a rural\narea predicts lower overall levels of disability, but not for\nWhite adults. Having a professional career is actually associ-\nated with higher levels of disability for Black adults, but it\nalsopredictsloweroveralltrajectoriesofdisability.Alternatively,\nhaving a labor career is associated with higher slopes of dis-\nability only for White older adults. Home ownership predicts\nlower levels of disability for White adults only.\nAmong health conditions, high blood pressure does not\nsignificantly affect the level or trajectory of disability for Black\nadults. It does, however, have a detrimental effect for White\nadults. Having diabetes likewise does not affect the overall le-\nvel of disability for Black adults, but it is associated with lower\nlevels of disability for White adults. Having broken bones at\nbaseline predicts lower disability slopes for Black adults but\nhas no significant effect for White adults. The negative rela-\ntionship between broken bones and the slope of disability over\ntime is probably indicative of the recovery process associated\nwith healing.\nNonrandom attrition is consequential for both groups. The\nattrition lambda is positive and significant for the slope of\ndisability among White older adults, indicating that those\nwho were at highest risk of attrition had higher trajectories\nof disability. Black older adults have positive and significant\nlambdas for both the level and slope of disability. Thus, those\nBlack subjects with the greatest likelihood of attrition had\nhigher levels of disability and the most rapid increases in\ndisability. This indicates that models that do not account for\nnonrandom selection underestimate the amount of disability--\nespecially among Black older adults.\nThe final stage of the analysis tests whether incident morbid-\nity, a direct measure of changing health status, accounted for\nall or some of the remaining racial disability gap. Table 4\npresents those results.\nAt each wave, respondents were asked whether they had\ndeveloped heart trouble, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes,\nhip fractures, broken bones, or cancer since the last interview.\nRather than being cumulative, these questions measure incident\nmorbidity. As seen in Table 4, the incident health conditions at\neach wave were not used as independent predictors of the level\nTable 4.

This is because the level and slope are\nestimated by using the disability measures from all waves\nsimultaneously, and using incident morbidity to estimate the\nlevel and slope would violate temporal ordering. Instead, dis-\nability at each wave was regressed on its wave-specific health\nconditions.\nIncident heart trouble, stroke, hip fracture, and broken bones\ncontributed to higher disability at the following wave. Newly\ndiagnosed cancer also predicts higher disability at later waves.\nThere were few changes in the other covariates compared to\nModel 2. However, the remaining significant difference in the\ndisability level between Black and White older adults was\nexplained with the incorporation of time-varying morbidities.\nDISCUSSION\nThis article began with three research questions: Does a racial\ndisability gap exist? If yes, what happens to that gap over time?\nDoes incident morbidity explain all or part of that gap? These\nanalyses demonstrate that, indeed, a disability gap between\nBlack and White adults exists and that the gap persists over\ntime. Before SES, morbidity, and social support were con-\ntrolled for, the gap continued to increase over time, which is\nconsistent with the cumulative disadvantage theoretical frame-\nwork (Dannefer, 1987). After social and health factors were\ncontrolled for, however, Black adults manifested a consis-\ntently higher level of disability, consistent with previous\nresearch on the double jeopardy hypothesis showing stability\nin race differences in health across the life course (Ferraro,\nsample of the EPESE, these results are parallel with these\nother studies, indicating persistent inequality in disability over\ntime between Black and White older adults, neither diverging\nnor converging. These findings are not consistent, however,\nwith a number of studies that have found a ``disability cross-\nover.'' Similar to the mortality crossover, some scholars report\nthat the racial disability gap converges and that the oldest-\nold Black adults eventually have better physical functioning\nthan their White counterparts (Clark et al., 1993; Guralnik,\nTo extend the examination of racial disability trajectories, we\nasked the following question: Is it possible that simply\ncontrolling for baseline health conditions did not account for\nthe impact from incident morbidity on physical function over\ntime? The final model in the analysis tested the effect of time-\nvarying indicators of morbidity on disability. In this study, all\nof the health conditions (heart trouble, stroke, diabetes, broken\nbones, broken hip, and cancer) except high blood pressure\nwere positively associated with disability at a minimum of one\nwave. It is not surprising that hypertension did not have an in-\ndependent effect on disability. It is often a risk factor for other\ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular health conditions such as a\nheart attack or stroke (Manton & Stallard, 1997).\nAfter covariates in Model 2 were controlled for, the\ndifference in the slope of disability between Black and White\nadults became nonsignificant. It is known that older Black\nadults are significantly more likely to have a number of health\nconditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular\ndisease, stroke, and most types of cancer (Bradley, Given, &\nBaseline health conditions accounted for some of the differ-\nence in overall level of disability by race, but the model in-\ncorporating incident morbidity rendered the racial differences in\ndisability nonsignificant. Thus, capturing the ``moving picture''\nof morbidity among older Black and White adults accounted for\nthe remaining disability gap and provided a better understand-\ning of the dynamics of health decline.\nThis article makes several contributions to the research on\nrace differences in health. First, it examines the disability gap\nbetween Black and White older adults with seven repeated\nmeasures of both disability and morbidity over time. With the\nuse of latent growth curve models, it was demonstrated that\nBlack older adults experience steeper increases in disability\nover time compared with White older adults, which is similar to\nmorbidity, socioeconomic resources, and social integration\nwere controlled, Black adults continued to have a higher level\nof disability but no longer differed significantly from White\nadults in the rate of disablement over time. Thus, examining the\ngroups separately demonstrates that even though a number of\npredictors of disability vary by race, the disability gap does not\ncontinue to increase over time. The gap is quite stable, indi-\ncating a persistent inequality among Black and White older\nadults. This finding is less common in the literature, but is\nconsistent with some previous studies (Clark & Maddox, 1992;\nThe second contribution is the adjustment for the effects of\nnonrandom attrition. In this sample of older adults, age and\nmortality selection do not temper the disability gap, as has been\nhypothesized in the past. In fact, older adults who were at the\nhighest risk of attrition had significantly higher levels of dis-\nability and steeper disability slopes and the bias was greatest\nfor Black older adults. A number of studies that have found\na disability crossover between Black and White older adults did\nnot account for selective survival (for an exception, see Mendes\nde Leon et al., 1997) and may be underestimating the\nexistence--and persistence--of disability. After an adjustment\nfor nonrandom attrition, these models provide no evidence that\ndisability converges or crosses over for Black and White older\nadults. Indeed, results from the present study suggest that\nfailure to consider attrition may give the appearance of\na convergence in disabilities among Black and White adults.\nFinally, time-varying indicators were incorporated into the\nestimates of the level and trajectory of disability over time.\nRather than relying solely on information at baseline, the time-\nvarying indicators allow the models to capture changes in pre-\ndictors over the course of observation. Although some variables\nsuch as income may not change drastically over the course of\nstudy, changes in morbidity can be very consequential. A single\nhealth condition such as a stroke could cause a sharp spike in\ndisability, but if it did not occur prior to baseline, then it may\nnot be captured in the model. Other time-varying covariates\nmay be consequential to physical functioning, such as changes\nin marital status, living arrangements, social support, and\ncognitive ability. These should be considered in future research.\nThere are two limitations of note in the present study. First,\nthese results are from a single geographic region in North\nCarolina and cannot be generalized to other areas of the United\nStates. Indeed, Mendes de Leon and colleagues (1997) found\ninconsistent results on the racial disability crossover in two\ndifferent areas of the nation; Black older adults had less\ndisability after age 75 than their White counterparts in the New\nHaven EPESE, but no such crossover was found in the North\nCarolina EPESE. The absence of a disability crossover between\nBlack and White older adults in North Carolina that has been\nfound in other regions may be due to differences in geography,\nsocial structure, and history. Health trajectories, begun decades\nbefore, may manifest consistently higher disability among sur-\nviving Black adults in North Carolina compared with those in\nother areas of the nation.\nSecond, the measurement of several key concepts is limited. In\nthese analyses, SES included income, education, home owner-\nship, employment status, and primary occupation. However, for\na complete understanding of the nature of economic disadvantage\namong older Black and White adults and its impact on subsequent\nhealth trajectories to be gained, a full spectrum of measures\nshould be included such as sources of income, eligibility for\nsocial programs, and intergenerational transfers. Additionally,\nthis research utilizes a single, one-dimensional measure of\ndisability. Restrictions in self-care such as bathing, dressing,\nand using the bathroom independently do not represent the vast\nmajority of community-dwelling elders. Hence, measurement of\ndisability that focuses on these extreme limitations in physical\nfunction risks a ``floor effect,'' whereby the majority of the\nsample has no or very few reportable difficulties. Further\nexamination of the nature of the racial disability gap requires\na multidimensional approach as called for in Verbrugge and Jette\n(1994), including the social, emotional, higher level physical\nfunctioning, cognitive, and sensory domains of disability.\nDisability is one more health outcome for which a racial\ndisparity exists. Even after nonrandom attrition is adjusted for,\nBlack adults have significantly higher levels of disability. Con-\ntrolling for SES, morbidity, and other covariates at baseline\ndid not fully explain the racial disability gap between Black and\nWhite older adults. Only after the time-varying effect of incident\nmorbidity was measured on the slope and trajectory of disability\ndid the residual race differences disappear. This means that Black\nelders, despite their hardiness, are more likely than their White\ncounterparts to experience compromised physical function as\na result of new health conditions and diseases.\n"
