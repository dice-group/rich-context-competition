This exploratory,\nqualitative study responds to a call in the literature to better understand what occurs in mentoring interactions by examining\nstorytelling as a mentoring tool. The focus is on how stories can convey meaning, inspire listeners, and transmit wisdom to\nhelp prot\u00e9g\u00e9s grow, learn, and develop in their jobs and careers. Interview data from 39 professionals working in a wide\nvariety of industries resulted in a rich data set of 48 work-related mentoring stories. Hermeneutical analysis enabled us to\nidentify key mentoring functions that are fulfilled in the narrative text of stories. We conclude that storytelling is indeed a\npowerful tool in mentoring--allowing mentors to calm their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, encourage them, help them solve problems, build\ntheir confidence, teach them, give them direction, and provide numerous other functions.\n",

They had just finished\nup at a women's shelter, where steam wisping from an iron had\nset off an alarm. Not much to it . . . for Jordan Sullivan, another\n15 hour shift was unspooling without what he so eagerly awaited.\nA fire. In his 96 days in the field as a firefighter, a probie out of\nthe Fire Academy--the Rock, as it's familiarly known--it had\nnot happened. Around the firehouse, the veterans continually\nswapped fire stories. That was how they both taught and regaled\none another, and the stories were good ones. He could not\ncontribute. He hadn't had a fire (Kleinfield, 2014, p. A1).\nMentors are all around us. In our own lives--both profes-\nsional and personal--they help us set goals, navigate diffi-\ncult situations, overcome challenges, develop skills, and\nlearn the ropes. But how is it that mentors impart their wis-\ndom? How do they act on the influence they have? What do\nthey say to inspire and role model for their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Those\nquestions about how mentors actually mentor are at the heart\nof the current research.\nMentoring relationships are central themes in many forms\nof popular culture and literature. Mentors appear in Homer's\nOdyssey, Frankenstein, and the Great Gatsby (Alleman &\n2007), but also in more contemporary films. For example,\nthe 1988American classic, Bull Durham, is a baseball movie,\nbut it is also a film about mentoring. Crash Davis, a veteran\nplayer is brought into the minor leagues to educate and teach\nEbby LaLoosh (aka Nuke, a hotshot rookie pitcher), but,\nwhile instructing Nuke on methods of control for his chaotic\npitching, Crash also acclimates Nuke to the pressure facing\nmajor league hitters while teaching him the ins and outs of a\nbaseball career (Mount & Shelton, 1988). Jump ahead to\n2013 and the R-rated hit film The Wolf of Wall Street depict-\ning Matthew McConaughey in a brief role early on in the\nfilm as Mark Hanna, mentor to Jordan Belfort (played by\nLeonardo DiCaprio). It is Hanna's questionable advice that\ntransforms Belfort from a young, na\u00efve, newly licensed\ntrader to the vile, scandalous crook that overshadows the\nscreen for nearly three hours (Hill, 2013). Belfort starts by\nthinking,\nBut if you can make your clients money at the same time, it's\nadvantageous to everyone, correct?\nTo which Hanna retorts,\n1Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY, USA\n2ADP, Global Enterprise Solutions North America, Roseland, NJ, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nCaroline P.

Move the money from your client's\npocket into your pocket (Scorsese, 2013).\nIn essence, Crash and Hanna are mentoring Nuke and Belfort\nby providing essential career advice, offering personal sup-\nport, helping them understand the way the industries work,\nand teaching them how to be good at their jobs.\nWhat these examples shed light on is not simply mentor-\ning in popular culture. They point to an underresearched area\nof the mentoring literature--how exactly it is that mentors\nhelp their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn. The body of literature on mentoring\nand related forms of developmental interactions has identi-\nfied many of the complex interpersonal, psychosocial, and\noutcome-related issues of mentoring, but the nature of the\ndevelopmental interactions that take place between mentors\nand their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s is less understood. This exploratory study\nwill examine one possible way that those relationships are\nmanifest--it will examine what role, if any, storytelling\nserves in mentoring interactions and how stories help men-\ntors fulfill advice-giving, supportive, and other developmen-\ntal functions of mentoring.\nOur motivation behind studying storytelling in the men-\ntoring context stems from the power of stories themselves.\nFirst, stories are multidimensional (Simmons, 2001), so they\ngo beyond just giving an audience an example. Second, sto-\nries illustrate what one means without imposing too much\ndetail to convey the idea of what is involved (Denning,\n2005). Moreover, the act of telling a story adds emotion and\nvisual details to the dialogue; in this way, storytelling is the\nprocess of translating the narrative into a compelling picture\nSimmons, 2001). As a result, storytelling allows for truthful,\nclear, and natural communication (Denning, 2005). Because\nmentoring scholars have indicated a gap in understanding\nhow mentors perform their functions (Chan, 2008), the cur-\nrent study will provide valuable insight into this underex-\nplored area.\nTheoretical Background and Relevant\nLiterature\nUnderpinning this research is a basic assumption that prot\u00e9-\ng\u00e9s learn from their mentors. Social learning theory would\nargue that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s can observe mentors as models, they can\nimitate them, and they can learn from the mentor's experi-\nences through a social exchange or socialization process\nThat theoretical context helps to explain how mentors can\nserve a developmental function for their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s whereby\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s need not only learn from experiencing something\nthemselves. Rather, they can learn by observing others or\nthrough a social process--akin to mentoring and, in this\ncase, storytelling. The following pages provide more detail\non the learning-by-mentoring process, the functions it pro-\nvides, and what that exchange or interaction can look like.\nMentoring Literature\nThe concept and practice of mentoring has been studied in a\nvariety of disciplines including education, psychology, and\nmanagement, making it an interdisciplinary concept\n& Schau, 1991). Although many definitions of mentoring\nhave been offered in these fields, most tend to agree that\nmentoring is a developmental interaction or partnership\n2001) in which a senior colleague (mentor) provides support\nand guidance to a junior colleague (prot\u00e9g\u00e9) for the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's\npersonal/professional growth (however, the mentor and pro-\nt\u00e9g\u00e9 can be on the same hierarchical level, in a reverse men-\ntoring relationship with a mentor junior to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, or\npart of a group of mentors (D'Abate et al., 2003; Eby et al.,\n2007; Eddy, D'Abate, Tannenbaum, Givens-Skeaton, &\n1988). Mentoring is sometimes characterized as a relation-\nship that can be intense and emotional (Kram, 1985;\nLevinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & McKee, 1978;\nShapiro, Hazeltine, & Rowe, 1978) or it can be seen as a\nprocess defined by the functions it provides (D'Abate et al.,\nFor example, its meaning has been based on the specific\nfunctions of upward mobility and support it provides to the\nSingh, Bains, & Vinnicombe, 2002) or, more specifically,\nlearning, career development, and/or emotional support\nfunctions through a variety of behaviors such as coaching,\ngoal setting, role modeling, encouraging, and socializing or\norienting the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to the company or industry (D'Abate\ncontext of the current study, though, one definition stands\nout. Lester and Johnson (1981) define mentoring as a \"one-\nto-one learning relationship between an older person and a\nyounger person that is based on modeling behavior and\nextended dialogue between them\" (p. 119). This notion of\nextended dialogue is what is in question in the current\nstudy--its substance, its meaning, its function, and its role in\ndelivering mentoring's value.\nFunctions of Mentoring\nThere has been a good bit of attention paid to the functions\nmentoring serves. From (a) psychosocial functions that build\nthe prot\u00e9g\u00e9's self-confidence and sense of identity to (b)\ncareer-related functions focusing on career/organizational\nadvancement, to (c) role modeling functions (Allen, Eby,\nD'Abate and Alpert 3\nmentoring has emerged as a complex interpersonal construct.\nIt can be broken down into 15 subfunctions that fall into\ncareer, psychosocial, and role modeling categories (Jacobi,\nnected to three high-level learning, career progression, and\nemotional/psychosocial support functions (e.g., teaching,\nadvising, problem solving, affirming, and confidence build-\nTypes of Mentoring\nIn addition to serving a number of functions, mentoring can\ntake various forms. Some mentoring relationships are more\ntraditional wherein the mentor is older or at a higher hierarchi-\ncal level and works face-to-face with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 via a formal\nmentoring program or a more informal, spontaneous, or seren-\ndipitous means of finding a good developmental partner\ntoring can take many alternative forms; some of those include\ngroup mentoring, reverse mentoring, distance/e-mentoring,\nand multiple mentor situations (Baugh & Scandura, 1999;\nBenefits of Mentoring\nEven though mentoring can take many forms and offer a\nvariety of developmental functions to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, it can also\nbe a two-way street with the relationship benefiting the men-\ntor (and the organization) as well as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. A mentor\ncan find career enrichment in the form of improved job per-\nformance, productivity increases, enhanced sources of infor-\nmation, a broader network, expanded technical/managerial/\ninterpersonal skills, unexpected recognition in the organiza-\ntion, a more motivated staff, as well as the good feelings (i.e.,\npsychic rewards) of helping others and being energized by a\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9's fresh perspective (Allen & Eby, 2003; Allen,\nProt\u00e9g\u00e9s, of course, can benefit from improved job perfor-\nmance, increased job satisfaction and organizational com-\nmitment, a stronger skill/knowledge set, more confidence, a\nbroader perspective, more understanding of the field/indus-\ntry/job, higher pay, and faster promotions (Allen et al., 2004;\nBut what surprises some is that the benefits of mentoring can\nfar exceed the mentor or the prot\u00e9g\u00e9--the organization can\nbenefit as well. Mentoring has been shown to benefit busi-\nnesses with the knowledge transfer that occurs, improved\nproductivity, greater employee loyalty, increased employee\nmotivation, and lower turnover (Crosby, 1999; Domeyer,\nallows businesses to facilitate growth via enhanced promo-\ntion of the corporate culture (Singh et al., 2002; Wanberg,\nThe Mentoring Interaction\nDespite all that is known about mentoring, the functions it\nserves, and the benefits it brings, not as much is known about\nwhat exactly occurs in the developmental interaction itself.\nWe do know that the location of the interaction and the mode\nof communication affect the relationship (Rutter, 1987;\nSullivan, 1995). For example, face-to-face and distance\n(email, telephone, and Internet chat) interactions can result in\ndifferent outcomes. We also know the duration of the rela-\ntionship and the frequency with which the mentor and pro-\nt\u00e9g\u00e9 interact will affect the outcomes of the mentorship. For\ninstance, studies have shown that relationships are more\nvaluable when the interactions are more frequent and when\nthe individuals involved have known one another for an\nextended period of time (Chao, Walz, & Gardner, 1992;\nLocke & Latham, 1990). In addition, the extant literature\ntells us the interactions themselves can be focused on differ-\nent developmental topics: work/life advice (i.e., centered\naround balancing work and family, managing stress), career\nadvice (in which the focus is on the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's career path,\nnetworking, and advancement), and job/skill/task advice\n(giving advice on a job-related task or problem (Eddy et al.,\nYet with all that we know about mentoring interactions,\nresearchers still do not know enough about how the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nlearns. There is some exploratory research suggesting that\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s tend to learn through observation and explanations\nfrom their mentors--observing the mentor's behaviors and\nthe way she or he interacts with others (Archard, 2012;\nstudy, a Chief Financial Officer described a time in his career\nwhen observation helped him learn:\n[I] observed [a senior management officer] managing other\npeople because he wasn't the smartest kid on the block and he\nwasn't the toughest kid on the block and he was managing\nwheelers and dealers and doing it effectively. And so my boss\nand I spent a lot of time looking at people in the organization,\nfiguring out how they manage people, and figuring out how to\nmanage them as a result of those observations.\nAnother way prot\u00e9g\u00e9s may learn is through explanation.\nHezlett (2005) suggests that, in some way, the mentor is\nexplaining something to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by giving advice, offering\ninformation, and/or explaining how to do something. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\nalso learn from their interactions with their mentors (Hale,\n2000), by \"gaining insights from the impact their mentors'\nthat observation and explanation may play in how prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\n4 SAGE Open\nlearn, more research is needed to examine this process--in\nother words, what is it that occurs in the mentoring interaction\nthat helps the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 learn, grow, and develop?\nStorytelling\nOne possible way that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s may learn is through stories\ntold by their mentor. Storytelling has received some attention\nfor its applications in adult learning, coaching, faculty devel-\nopment, and management development (Caminotti & Gray,\non mentoring has identified this potential in mentoring\nexchanges. Chan (2008) sought to understand mentor prac-\ntices for predoctoral students and noted that \"little research\nhas been conducted on the actual practices in a mentoring\nrelationship, [and] it is unclear how mentors fulfill [mentor-\ning] functions\" (p. 264). Chan's article identified validation,\nresponsiveness, and giving time as mentoring practices in the\nfour mentoring dyads she studied--sharing candid stories\nabout their own personal experiences in graduate school was\nanother mentoring practice that emerged from her data.\nHowever, little focus was given in the article to what those\nstories might have been about or how (as a mentoring prac-\ntice) they served mentoring functions.\nBecause stories tend to illustrate points better than simply\nstating the point themselves (Schank, 1990), a story can be\ndefined as a narrative account of an event, or events, that\nweaves the relational aspects of detail, character, and values\n2001). They can be powerful mechanisms for learning as\n\"most experiences are shared through story, some long, some\nshort, but always through a story\" (Caminotti & Gray, 2012,\np. 431). Stories are comprised of layers; the external layer\nfocuses on the aspects of the story that is analyzed and dis-\nsected into parts, while a story's internal layer focuses more\non the actual experience and how that experience conveys an\nimage and/or message (Denning, 2005). Stories can enhance\none's perspective, change perceptions, or motivate the lis-\ntener as they persuade and influence others, create commu-\nnity, transmit knowledge, and share wisdom (Brown,\nSimmons, 2001). It has been said that \"we value stories\nbecause they are like reports of research projects, only easier\nmakes sense, then, that storytelling has been used as a tool\nfor learning in a multitude of disciplines including history,\nEnglish, and business. In business, the concept has been seen\nas both a management development tool as well as a career\ndevelopment tool. According to Denning (2001),\nStorytelling enables the individuals in an organization to see\nthemselves, the situation they are currently in, and the\norganization in a different light and accordingly take decisions\nand change their behavior in accordance with these new\nperceptions, insights, and identities (p. xiv).\nIt enables people to connect to what is important and helps\nthem make sense of their current situation within society,\nbusiness, an organization, or their own careers. Therefore,\nbased on this understanding, it is plausible that storytelling is\none way that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn during a mentoring interaction,\nyet as Carr andAnn (2011) note, \"What eludes us is a breadth\nand depth of analysis of how coaches [or mentors] use stories\nand for what reasons\" (p. 237).\nStatement of Purpose\nFrom the preceding discussion, it should be evident that\nhow mentors help their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn is an underresearched\narea of the mentoring literature. Given that (a) mentoring is\na valuable developmental relationship for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, men-\ntors, and their employing organizations and that (b) research-\ners have identified the functions mentoring serves, the\ncommon types of mentoring relationships, and some charac-\nteristics of the interaction, the means by which this develop-\nmental support and sharing of expertise occurs still deserves\nmore clarification. Granted, exploratory research has sug-\ngested that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn through observation, explanation,\nand interaction with their mentor or mentors (Hezlett, 2005).\nHowever, the actual interactions that are occurring, the top-\nics of conversation, and the mechanics of sharing expertise\nremain unknown--a gap that is particularly evident when\nstorytelling has been argued to serve as a powerful mecha-\nnism for learning.\nFor that reason, the current study attempts to bridge the\nmentoring and storytelling divide to explore how a mentor's\nstories could be the mechanism that shares the mentor's\nexpertise, teaches the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, gives the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 advice and\nencouragement, and boosts the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's confidence, while\npossible serving other mentoring functions (D'Abate et al.,\nexamine storytelling for its role in mentoring interactions.\nMethod\nTo examine the utility of storytelling in mentoring, the cur-\nrent research utilized qualitative methods to capture rich\ndescriptions of mentoring interactions and to enhance under-\nstanding of the context of any storytelling event that was\nrecounted (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Paired with an explor-\natory approach, we examined whether stories are an effective\nor ineffective tool in mentoring, as well as explored what\ncharacteristics of stories are effective in fostering learning\nand development.\nSampling\nIt was not our goal to study mentoring in a particular field or\nindustry; instead, we sought participants from a variety of\nindustries and backgrounds who were currently serving as\nsomeone's mentor or who had been a mentor or a prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nD'Abate and Alpert 5\nConvenience and purposive sampling techniques (Kerlinger,\nGiven that one of the researchers had a family member who\nwas in a C-suite position and had worked with many differ-\nent industries over the years, she had access to this large cir-\ncle of personal contacts/acquaintances who could speak to\nthe experience of storytelling as part of the mentoring rela-\ntionship or interaction. From this pool of prospective partici-\npants, we utilized a snowball sampling method--asking\ninterviewees to offer one or two names of other individuals\nwho might also meet the needs of the study (Welch, 1975).\nSuch procedures produced a pool of 39 interviewees varying\n46% were female. They represented a wide array of indus-\ntries including law, medicine, marketing, finance, religion,\nfood and beverage, consumer products, telecommunications,\nand sales and held high-level positions in their respective\nfields (e.g., Chief Financial Officer, CEO and President,\nClinical Psychologist, Executive Director of Compliance,\nExecutive Vice President of Sales, and Senior Vice President\nof Marketing).\nData Collection, Coding, and Analysis\nThe interviews were held face-to-face in either the partici-\npant's office or a neutral location (e.g., coffee shop) and fol-\nlowed a semistructured interview protocol (see the appendix)\nwhich comprised of open-ended questions pertaining to\nmentoring relationships the participants had been in or were\nin at the time. We started by gaining consensus around the\ncentral concept of mentoring by discussing a definition of the\nterm. We, then, asked participants open-ended questions\nabout their experiences as a mentor and/or a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (e.g.,\ncan you think of someone you've mentored or who has men-\ntored you, what did you learn from them, etc.). They were\nthen asked to share a story (or stories) that they had told to\ntheir prot\u00e9g\u00e9s or had been told by their mentors. Participants\nwere asked to specifically describe what they learned from\nthe stories and how they applied the lessons to their careers,\nor--from the mentor's perspective--what they were trying\nto teach their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s through the stories. The interviews\nwere recorded with permission and then transcribed; record-\nings were destroyed following transcription with only the\nresearchers having access to the recordings. After transcrib-\ning, the interviews were analyzed on a password protected\nspreadsheet by the researchers using textual analysis, in the\nform of hermeneutics.\nHermeneutics encompasses the issues of text and inter-\npretation while discovering the authentic message hidden\n2012). In other words, hermeneutics allows researchers and\ninterpreters to see how symbolic texts are, and how they refer\nto something beyond their literal meaning and beyond the\nauthor's intended meaning (Phillips & Brown, 1993; Prasad,\n2002). Hermeneutics is extremely useful in studying people\nas organizations as it \"get[s] to the kernel of events and activ-\nities by understanding the relationship between the obvious\nfeatures of a text and the driving forces behind them\" (Prasad,\nthe story itself but also the context of each story. The \"exami-\nnation of the context [of each story] sheds light on the [story]\nitself, whereas an examination of the text, in its turn, [illumi-\nnated] our understanding of [each story's] context\" (Prasad,\ntrate how lives can be understood, revealed and transformed\nin stories and by the very act of storytelling\" (Sandelowski,\ngo beyond each participant's story (or stories) at face value\nand discern the functions of mentoring each story provided.\nBefore getting to the results, it is important to illuminate\nthis hermeneutical analysis method with an example, rather\nthan just the description provided above. Let us use one of\nthe stories we gathered to illustrate this method. This tech-\nnology director tells a story to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 regarding when he\nfirst started his career. He made a significant error by delet-\ning a mail system on the organization's server:\nI was starting, my very first year, and, I blew it. I blew it bad. My\nboss told me to delete a system. It was an email system where it\nwas located. So he said \"Delete the mail system.\" So I went and\nfound a directory that said \"mail\" and I deleted it. And then\nabout a half an hour later, 4:30 in the afternoon, the phone\nstarted ringing. People couldn't print, and I didn't think anything\nof it, and everyone said we will deal with it in the morning.\nWhen I got in at 7:30 the next morning, people couldn't log onto\nthe system because that directory that said \"mail\" on it held all\nof the information for people to get on: passwords, print\npasswords, everything else. And there was a group of about 200\nto 250 people . . . that couldn't work. It was bad.\nAlthough the appearance of this story seems like just a tale\nof making a mistake early in one's career, the authentic\nmeaning, however, is much more. Using hermeneutics as\nour analytical method pushed us to not analyze the story by\nthe words or sentences, but by the larger message. Being\nforced to think about the story as a whole, to understand the\ncontext, helped us see that the mentor, in telling this story to\nhis prot\u00e9g\u00e9, is saying that everyone makes mistakes--that it\nis okay to fail.\nTherefore, it was our method to take the story's informa-\ntion and, working independently, code it according to men-\ntoring functions from the literature. We started with the list\nof definitions provided by D'Abate et al. (2003) for 23 dif-\nferent mentoring functions and whittled that down to 12\nfunctions that could possibly be served by storytelling. The\nexcluded 11 functions could not be achieved via storytelling\nbecause they described activities that a mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nwould actually do together (such as collaborating, when the\npair actually work together; observing, when the mentor\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

These functions were derived from D'Abate, Eddy, and Tannenbaum's (2003) framework of mentoring and developmental interaction functions. A\nnumber of functions from that framework did not apply to the current study because they involved activities that a mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would actually\ndo together (e.g., a mentor observing a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a mentor providing a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with an opportunity to practice a skill), rather than functions that could be\nserved by a story (e.g., a mentor encouraging a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with his or her story).

Table 1 lists the resulting\n12 mentoring functions, grouped into three categories that\nhad potential for being served by storytelling. This coding\ntaxonomy (LeCompte, 2000) was the basis for our herme-\nneutical analysis; in other words, it was our coding schema\nwhereby we coded the overall message of each story for the\nfunctions it was serving.\nTo further clarify our method, we coded the sample story\nabove as providing the emotional support function of affir-\nmation by offering the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 support in the form of accep-\ntance and confirmation. This story also served a teaching\nfunction--in the sample text, the mentor was teaching the\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 about failure. As the mentor stated,\nI was trying to teach [my prot\u00e9g\u00e9] that it's not failing that is the\nissue here. It's [how] you deal with the failure [and] what you\nlearned from the failure.\nValidity Issues\nFirst, in regard to data saturation, which is a key component\nin the validity of research findings (Fusch & Ness, 2015),\nwe subscribed to general convention among qualitative\nresearchers. For example, Guest, Bunce, and Johnson\n(2006) note, \"Twelve interviews should suffice\" with larger\nsamples for less clear research questions (p. 79), and Fusch\nand Ness (2015) indicate that saturation occurs when addi-\ntional data results in the same coding and themes. So, while\n\"there is no one-size-fits-all method to reach data satura-\nhad a clearly defined research question and coding schema,\nso we assumed data saturation was reached when each\nfunction we were coding for was represented--with some\nfunctions present in more than 20 stories. Thus, for this\nstudy, data saturation was achieved with 48 stories culled\nfrom 39 interviewees.\nSecond, in keeping with methods of establishing validity\nin qualitative studies, three different procedures were used to\ndetermine the credibility of the inferences drawn from the\ndata (i.e., the credibility of the research findings; Creswell &\nlens (Creswell & Miller, 2000) was applied to check reliabil-\nity using Holsti's (1969) method. We computed \"the ratio of\ncoding agreements to the total number of coding decisions\"\nby comparing the coding patterns of one researcher against\nthe researchers made 20 coding decisions and agreed on 15\nof them, our coefficient of reliability (CR) would be .75. In\nthis case, with agreement on 95 out of 112 pieces of data\ncoded, an 85% CR or level of interrater agreement was\nD'Abate and Alpert 7\nachieved. Second, a participant-based lens was applied in the\nform of member checking. Given the high-level positions of\nmany of our interviewees, we were not able to meet with\nthem a second time for the participants to confirm how the\ndata were interpreted (Creswell & Miller, 2000). Instead, we\nrelied on data from the participants themselves at the time of\nthe interview. Recall that the data collection process involved\nasking participants to share stories from their own mentoring\ninteractions, as well as inviting participants to explain what\nthey thought they had learned (or in the case of mentors,\nwhat they thought they had taught) through the story in ques-\ntion. These data (kept separate from the story text during the\ncoding process) helped establish validity (see \"Validity\"\nunder \"Results\" section) and support \"the `goodness' of ana-\nlyzed data\" as it allowed the researchers to double check that\nthe codes applied (and inferences drawn) were in agreement\nwith what the participants thought they had learned or taught\nexplain rich, thick description as another method of estab-\nlishing validity in qualitative research. Providing as much\ndescription as possible to the reader \"creates verisimilitude\";\nin other words, the inclusion of extensive detail \"produce[s]\nfor readers the feeling that they have experienced or could\nexperience, the events being described in a study\"--in this\ncase, making the reader understand what it is/was like to hear\na story from a mentor firsthand (Creswell & Miller, 2000, p.\n129). For this reason, we present extensive description of the\nstorytelling data collected.\nResults\nThe 39 interviews provided 48 stories rich in detail and sig-\nnificantly different from one another. For example, some of\nthe stories told were in the third person, were short and\nstraight to the point, and used sayings to help clarify the\npoint to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Other stories were actual experiences of\nthe interviewee or the interviewee's mentor. These stories\nwere effective because they produced emotion, sometimes\neven laughter or tears, out of both the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the mentor.\nAt the same time, other personal stories were told to bring a\nsense of relief to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and to let them know that they\nare not alone--that certain situations happen to everyone.\nMentoring Functions Served\nAnalysis of the interview data demonstrated that the stories\nmentors tell their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s serve a variety of key mentoring\nfunctions--some serving one function while others serving\nseveral (see Table 1 for frequency/percentages of functions\nbeing represented in stories, as well as rank from most fre-\nquently served mentoring function to least).\n[add paragraph indent]For example, a Director of Fixed\nIncome Analytics reported telling her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s a story of the\nchallenge she had in trying to sell her company's product to\nCompany X:\nI was selling into Boston for years and years, and [Company X]\nbought every product from every other vendor but me . . . I was\ntrying to figure out how I [could] get into [Company X]. So I\nwould visit them consistently, build relationships, and I kept\ncalling and calling on them . . . And what happened, just in\nconversations, is they said that they get financial data from\nmany different sources and there's a lot of time they have to\n[devote to] maintain that data for the quality. And the data\nactually is the basis for compensation for the portfolio managers\n. . . so it's very critical data. And so, they're getting it from all of\nthese different sources and it's very expensive data management.\nWell, I knew . . . that we did the same thing for our own system.\nSo . . . I arranged for us to do what is called a feed of data, a data\nfeed to [Company X]. Now this goes back over ten years ago\nwhen this was not popular. Now this is a very big thing. So this\nwas a new product for our company. We made gobs of money,\nand they basically told me anytime they needed more data they\nwould call me. So it was like a cash cow. So, it really was\nfiguring out their need and being persistent and no other vendor\ncould do that . . . And now it's big business, but in those years, it\nwasn't. The story is talking about persistence, about not giving\nup because they didn't close the door in my face. They always\nsaid, \"We have no need for your product,\" but I kept the\nconversation going.\nTextual analysis showed that multiple mentoring func-\ntions were served by this story including teaching, role mod-\neling, encouraging and motivating, problem solving, and\nsocialization to the sales industry. First, this story provided\nthe function of teaching by helping prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn how to be\nconsultants and how to gain the trust of the client. Second,\nthis story also provided the functions of role modeling and\nencouraging with its references to persistence and not giving\nup. This mentor's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are not only able to learn from\nthis example, but also, by seeing that their mentor did not\ngive up when facing a challenge, the story encourages and\nmotivates them not to give up when a situation becomes dif-\nficult. Third, the role modeling function is also served by this\nstory. As the interviewee explained,\n[The story] talks about figuring out the [customer's] need . . .\nYou've got to figure out the need and see what in my tool chest\nmeets that need?\nFinally, the story teaches prot\u00e9g\u00e9s about the sales industry\nand the challenges they could possibly face when working in\nthe field of sales (i.e., a socialization function).\nMost Prevalent Functions\nWhen examining the interview data, it appears that most of\nthe functions served by the stories were teaching and role\nthese functions, respectively. Socialization was also prevalent\nin the stories with 13 (27%) of the stories demonstrating this\nfunction. Calming was served by 19% of the stories, encour-\nagement by 17%, problem solving and confidence building\n8 SAGE Open\nby 15%, and direction and personal/emotional support were\nserved by 8% of the stories. The most frequent emotional sup-\nport function served was affirmation with a frequency of 10\n(or 21%). The following example shared by a clinical psy-\nchologist depicts a story that provides affirmation:\nWhat I share [is] my first meeting as well as the continuation of\ntherapy with this particular difficult patient. I had this patient\nthat was 15 or 16 years old, and he walked into my office. All I\nknew about him prior to walking into my office was that he had\nbeen in the foster care system for probably about a decade, so\nvirtually for all of his life, that he had committed arson, has been\nconvicted of arson, and had been in juvenile hall. He had a\nrecord, and he was probably in gangs . . . He was living at a\nhalfway house at that point since no foster family wanted him.\nWhat I share with [my prot\u00e9g\u00e9] was . . . this 15 or 16 year old\nboy walked into my office and he closed the door and I was\nsitting in a chair which was in the middle of my office, and he\nproceeded in a very menacing way of walking 360 degrees\naround my chair. He was trying to set his territory. He was trying\nto let me know that he was a dangerous fellow. And then he\npulled out his knife, it was about six or eight inches [long] and\nsaid, \"I'll just use this,\" and started flicking at his fingernails. So\nclearly his communication to me was that he has always been in\ncharge or that he feels that he has a need to be that way because\nhe is always being threatened and that he was not going to be\neasily engaged in the process. I, then, share with her that after he\nhad finished walking around me, this 15 or 16 year old boy with\nhis knife, . . . the first thing that I said to him was, \"In this room,\neverybody stays safe, so I would appreciate it if you would take\nyour knife and put it outside and then come back in,\" which he\ndid. I think he was a little disarmed by the fact that I wasn't\nfreaking out. I didn't show him fear . . . He then came back in\nand he wasn't going to talk and he was just doing this because he\nwas mandated by the court as part of his probation and I said,\n\"Fine, do whatever you want. Have you ever done this before?\"\nHe said, \"Oh yeah. They always drag me to this or that or\nwhatever, but this is stupid . . . No one is going to analyze me.\"\n[To which] I opened up a cabinet and said, \"Got a lot of stuff in\nhere. Anything interest you?\" To which this 16 year old [tough\nkid] pulls out Candy Land.\nThrough hearing this story, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was able to realize\nthat she was not alone and many psychologists have experi-\nenced a situation with a difficult patient. This valuable bit of\naffirmation came along with a key teaching moment--help-\ning the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 learn skills for communicating with challeng-\ning patients.\nAnother story provided by an attorney provides a differ-\nent perspective on the teaching function of mentoring:\nOne story was actually a story that was told to me, and it is . . .\nuseful in learning how to argue an appeal. It [is] . . . about [a\nlawyer who] had gone up to the Court of Appeals to argue a\ncase. He was the respondent. The appellant got up and argued\nand beat the crap out of the appellant. So when he got up, he\nsaid, \"If the court has no questions, I'll rest on my brief.\" In the\ncourse of time, he won the appeal, and he sent the client a bill for\n$15,000. The client called him up and said, \"You know, that is a\nlot of money. You said like five words.\" He said, \"You are right.\nI will send you a new bill . . . A trip to the Court of Appeals and\nIn essence, her mentor was teaching her how to argue an\nappeal and that:\nYou have to know when not to talk . . . [and] when to stop\ntalking.\nAs for confidence building (a form of social\u00ademotional\nsupport), a physician reported telling the following story to\nmedical school students who are smart but (according to her)\nnot very sure of themselves--this is not a story she tells to\nstudents who exude arrogance in any way, but to those who\nneed to know it is okay to be assertive sometimes in their\nmedical careers. According to this mentor,\nThey have to know that there is a place for assertiveness . . . One\nof the stories I tell is one where I was an intern and . . . the low\nman on the totem pole. A ten year old girl came in unconscious\nand she was found to be a juvenile diabetic. As the first person\nto see her, I got close to her grandmother who was actually\nwatching her over Christmas break while her parents were away.\nThe grandmother was quite agitated, of course. This happened\nall of a sudden and the patient was going into shock, so I was\nwith them first and for most of the time. I felt that she needed\nmore fluids. My senior resident disagreed and I stayed [with] her\nall night and kept turning up her IV to give her more fluids. He\nwould come in and get very agitated with me because he\ndisagreed. He lowered the IV rates, and I was in a difficult\nsituation because I felt I was inexperienced, but I wanted to trust\nmy gut reaction. But I kept sneaking the IV in, and I stayed with\nher all night as she went into shock. And it got worse, and she\neventually had to go to the operating room . . . The surgeon who\nwent in was horrified and said he hadn't seen anything like that\nin a child in his career. She died, and I was touched deeply by it.\nI had gotten close to the family and the girl and [I] was\nemotionally conflicted because I felt like I could have saved her\nif I had stood up [more] for myself . . . In medicine, when\nsomeone dies, we have what is called a morbidity and mortality\nconference where they go over the case and see why someone\ndied. It was very emotional for me and the people who were\nsupporting the senior resident who had presented his case to put\nhimself in a better light. I got angry and told them . . . \"I don't\nmake a good Nazi. I didn't want to follow orders.\" And they\nwere saying, \"But you are only an intern and you were supposed\nto follow orders and you didn't follow orders.\" The surgeon\nsupported me, but, because of my outburst, they threatened to\nkick me out of the program and, at that point, I had to decide . .\n. \"Well,\" I said, \"then kick me out. I feel like what I did was\nresponsible, and I took care of my patient the best way I could.\"\n. . . There is a downside to not being assertive when deep down\nyou know that you are right.\nGiven that mentoring can serve three high-level functions\n(learning, emotional support, and career progression), it is\nD'Abate and Alpert 9\nalso important to recognize that one story alone can accom-\nplish all three functions. Analysis of the following story from\nan Executive Vice President of Sales shows that the sharing\nof a personal career experience can satisfy role modeling\n(learning), affirmation (emotional support), and socialization\n(career progression) needs for a prot\u00e9g\u00e9:\nThere was a new buyer at [Superbig Grocery Store]. Sales in the\nfirst six months were through the roof. We were so pleased . . . I\nwent in with a sales report and an award. We had, at these times\n. . . little . . . trophies. So I gave him the sales report, and he took\nthe report and ripped it up and threw it in the garbage. And I was\nwith a broker sitting next to me, and I looked at the broker and\nhe didn't say a word and gave me no direction. I was like, \"Oh\nboy, what do I do now?\" Well, we would like to present you with\nthis . . . award. I gave him the little trophy, and he took it and\nthrew it in the garbage. I started sweating. I felt it dripping down\nthe sides of my body. He says, \"Do you know what you are\ndoing right now?\" And I said to him, \"I have no idea what I am\ndoing right now.\" Well, he said something like \"I was wasting\nhis time and my time\" and he said, \"there is only one way to sell\napple juice, 99 cents.\" Well, I said, \"Listen, at 99 cents, I lose\nmoney.\" He says, \"You are not listening to me. That is the only\nway to sell the product, 99 cents. Alright? This meeting is over.\nGet out of here.\"And I said, \"Okay.\"And I got up and the broker\nfollowed me out. And we are in the hallway and I said, \"Oh\nman!\" And the broker says to me, \"You were great in there.\" I\nsaid \"What? I was great in there?\" He says, \"You were great.\" I\nsaid \"How? Were you in the same meeting that I was in? Because\nthat meeting in there, that was not great!\" He says, \"He was\ntrying to get you upset. He was trying to get you mad. He was\ntrying to get something out of you, and you didn't let him get to\nyou.\" And I said, \"Well, I didn't do that on purpose because I\nwas really scared in there.\" Turned out, the second we left the\noffice, he went to the garbage and he took out the trophy, and he\nran down the hall to one of the owners of [Superbig Grocery\nStore] . . . and he says, \"Look at what I just won! Look at what I\njust got us!\" So he was trying to get me upset. This is some of\nthe enjoyment he got in dealing with the power. He is the buyer.\nThat is where the power is. I'm the salesman. I'm the low level\nguy and, by not overreacting and by not getting into a fight, he\ntook a liking to me and he thought I was honest when I said I\ncan't afford this.\nIn terms of role modeling, the story itself is about how the\nmentor dealt with this tough situation, which provides an\nexample of how the mentee might deal with one too. In addi-\ntion, the text of this story serves a valuable socialization\nfunction--telling the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 how things work in this field.\nFinally, as the interviewee himself noted,\n[There are] a lot of situations where buyers have been rude,\ncrude, mean, . . . and it is okay to take it . . . You can't win every\nbattle. You are going to lose some. It's okay to just go back and\ntry again.\nThat statement alone explains why this narrative provides\nacceptance and affirmation to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who hears it.\nValidity\nAs described earlier, one of several methods utilized to estab-\nlish validity in this qualitative, exploratory study was mem-\nber checking (Creswell & Miller, 2000). Indeed, the textual\ndata of the stories paired with member-checking data (gath-\nered at the time of the interviews, but kept separate during\nhermeneutical/textual analysis) did provide a good bit of evi-\ndence that the inferences drawn were in agreement with what\nthe participants thought they were teaching or learning. For\nexample, we coded the following story from a global market\nresearch executive as serving a role modeling function of\nmentoring:\nThis is a story [about something that took place] at a very big\nmeeting with a very large, very well-known technology firm.\nWe were bidding on a multi-million dollar study and project,\nand it was a bunch of our senior people which included our CEO\nand our President, and we worked through lunch. It was a fairly\nhard-fought thing because the company was fairly rigid in its\nthinking at that time, and they were also very strict on pricing.\nAnd we're a quality firm . . . we demand that we, at least, get\npaid for the type of work that we do . . . But we also brought in\na boxed lunch while we worked through lunch over this thing.\nLunch was on paper plates (even though they had [porcelain]\ndishes there), [and] when lunch was over, our CEO (while still\ntalking and making his point) was going around picking up the\npaper plates and putting them in the garbage. When the meeting\nwas over, the CEO said, \"I wanted to show them that we have\nhumility\" . . . he was teaching a lesson . . . \"We're there to be\ntheir consultants, and we will do anything for them. And, while\nI'm not telling them I'm going to go there and pick up their\ngarbage for them, but just the fact that they could see the CEO\nof this fairly large research firm get up and help clean off the\ntable.\" He didn't state that he was doing [it], he just did it as a\nmatter of fact . . . as if he were in his own home.\nWhen asked what this story about a CEO's humility taught\nhim, the participant explained the role modeling value. He\nexplained how this story would show a prot\u00e9g\u00e9:\nThat I'm humble and not rigid [and it demonstrates] that we are\nhere to serve them . . . that was the point he was making [in\npicking up after everyone].\nSo, the way in which our coding aligned with the partici-\npant's member checking data helps establish validity in this\nqualitative study.\nAnother example from an executive communications\ncoach also illustrates this validation process. This is a story\nshe has told her prot\u00e9g\u00e9:\nOne of my clients asked me to shadow a group of their sales\npeople and go out on client meetings. So we figured out a way to\nintroduce me [as] a consultant that [could help them] . . . So I\nwent out on a meeting with a consultant who was meeting with\nan older woman, her two sons, her accountant, and her attorney.\nAnd I said, \"You know . . . if you were this guy going out to meet\nwith this group of people . . . who is the decision maker there?\"\nAnd he said, \"Well, the woman, of course. It's her money . . .\nShe had herself, two sons (an older and a younger son), an\naccountant, an attorney, and the investment planner [who all] sat\nin front of them and gave all of the eye contact and delivered all\nof the data to the accountant who he thought was the person who\nmanaged the mother's estate. When they were all finished, he\ngave a little eye contact to the attorney and to the woman and the\nolder brother, and as we walked out the door, I followed behind.\nAnd the attorney and the accountant walked out the door, and\nthe mother and two sons followed behind on either side. And she\nfirst looked at the older son and said, \"So, what do you think?\"\nAnd he said, \"I don't know. I wouldn't work with him. He didn't\npay me no mind.\" [And then] the mother asked the other brother,\n\"What do you think?\" And he said, \"You know, Mom, it is your\nestate. But when you are gone, I'm not sure I really want to work\nwith this company. This guy seems like all he wants to do is\nwork with the decision makers. We want to have a personal\nrelationship with the guy that is managing our money.\" So she\nsays okay and the company did lose that account. And it took\nthis investment manager a long time to regain the confidence of\nthe woman, and he had to spend a lot more time playing golf\nwith the younger brother and doing some other things to get to\nknow them.\nOur hermeneutical analysis coded this story for serving the\nteaching function of mentoring. Indeed, member checking\ndata from the participant confirmed this interpretation. She\nexplained,\nOnce you lose an account, it is harder to start and try to get a new\naccount. So when I had my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 think about the story I just\ntold, we revamped his game plan for [his upcoming] meeting\nbecause what I made him think about is in that list of data that\nyou want to present at the meeting, how much of it [concerns]\nthe younger folks--the people who are going to inherit that\nestate. And he said, \"You are right.\" There are a couple of things\nthey are going to be concerned about. And I said the other thing\nyou need to do is to look at them when you are talking about that\ndata. Because if everybody is invited to that meeting, everybody\ndeserves equal time. Those kids wouldn't have been invited if\nmom didn't see them as influencers and have some input on her\ndecision . . . the story was what taught him to be aware of,\n\"[Darn], I could lose this account if I don't pay attention to who\nthe influencers are beyond the decision maker.\"\nIt is reassuring that our own analytical coding process\naligned with the interpretations of the participants them-\nselves. That these data were kept separate from the story data\nduring our coding process helped us confirm that we did \"get\nDiscussion\nThe current study set out to fill a gap in the literature--to\nunderstand what occurs in the mentoring interaction (Hezlett,\ndialogue\" (p. 119) between a mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Although a\nfew studies have used storytelling as a means of collecting\ndata on when, where, and why mentoring exchanges take\nplace (e.g., Spezzini, Austin, Abbott, & Littleton, 2009) or\nraised the possibility that stories might play a role in mentor-\nthe content of mentoring stories and the functions they serve\nhave remained unclear. In response, the current study pro-\nvided evidence that storytelling is an important mentoring\npractice. Both hermeneutical analysis of the narrative text of\nthe stories, as well as comments by the interviewees them-\nselves, showed that a mentor's stories can serve key mentor-\ning functions.\nFurther analysis might suggest why storytelling works in\nmentoring interactions. Our participants helped us understand\nthe power of storytelling may rest in a number of key charac-\nteristics. First, stories are real in some way so they are relat-\nable. A pharmaceutical communications executive told us,\nThe point of [the story] is that it make[s] it real . . . [this is what]\nreally makes a difference, that sinks in.\nA clinical psychologist added,\nI feel that storytelling is a really important way of communicating\nin a mentoring relationship. A person relates more to a story than\nto a lecture.\nIndeed, it may be the emotion inherent in a story that makes\nthem more relatable. A technology director told us,\n[Stories are] hard and emotional. The reason that storytelling\nworks is that you have to find the emotional ground.\nAnother reason storytelling might be powerful in mentoring\nis because stories are rich in detail which makes them more\nimpactful than simple instructions or advice given without\nthe context of a story. One of our interviewees, a doctor,\nexplained,\nStories are also more than just words; they convey images.\nA similar explanation was provided by the founder of a con-\nsumer food products firm who told us,\nIt helps to give them some color, some technicolor behind an\nissue . . . By giving them the experience in a story, it . . . makes\nit more vivid. It makes it more memorable. It's not just a piece\nof advice; it's advice that comes from an experience.\nIn summation, stories are emotional. They are memora-\nble. They do not just tell the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 what to do or deliver\nadvice on a problem. Instead, they inspire. The results of this\nstudy demonstrate that because stories are more than just\nwords, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are able to remember pieces of stories their\nmentors told them and apply them to their everyday life.\nStories, therefore, are impactful--so impactful, that they\nD'Abate and Alpert 11\nmight go beyond the relationship between just one mentor\nand one prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to become company folklore. As one media\ndirector explained,\nI do know that parts of the stories [I tell] get retold because I\nhear these people . . . who repeat them when I sit in the\nbackground and watch them make presentations or interact with\nour internal or external clients. I hear pieces of these stories get\nrepeated which I like because it is usually done not identical to\nthe way that I've retold them. They were extrapolations of the\ninformation I was trying to convey to them.\nFuture Research and Limitations\nBased on the results of the current study, future research\nmight take alternate data collection paths to explore other\nbenefits of storytelling as a means for mentoring or examine\nhow storytelling affects other aspects of mentoring (e.g.,\nmentoring phases). First, out of the 39 interviews, nine (23%)\ncould not be used for data because the interviewee shared\nstories about when they were mentoring or being mentored,\nrather than the story they or their mentor used in a develop-\nmental interaction. To avoid this problem, future research\nmight approach the semistructured interview so the inter-\nviewee is prompted in a different way:\nPretend I [the interviewer] am your prot\u00e9g\u00e9. What's an example\nof a story you would tell me to make a point?\nBy placing the interviewee in a hypothetical situation, the\ninterviewee may be able to recall a story they told to their\nactual prot\u00e9g\u00e9(s) they could not without such a prompt. In\naddition, the semistructured interview should include not\nonly a definition of mentoring but also the definition of a\nstory. Several interviewees were confused with the term story\nand did not realize that the experiences they share with their\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s or peers might actually include such stories.\nClarification of the term and examples or personal experi-\nences the interviewees had that fall under the definition of\nstories would be very useful toward the success of future\nstudies. Finally, since this study examined how prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\nlearned through storytelling, future research might also exam-\nine the power of storytelling in different phases of mentoring\n(i.e., initiation, cultivation, separation, and redefinition; Chao,\nbe how different types of stories are used to achieve varying\ndevelopmental goals in different phases of mentoring.\nConclusion\nDespite these limitations and suggestions for future research,\nthe current research offers a perspective on mentoring that has\nnot yet been explored in depth. It suggests that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn\nfrom their mentors through mentoring interactions, specifically\nthrough the stories that mentors tell their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. As Hezlett\nwrote (2005), \" . . . the literature offers only limited insights on\nhow prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn from their mentors . . . \" (p. 512), so there is\nstill a need to examine what and how prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn from their\nmentors.Authors have only recently started to identify storytell-\ning as a potential mechanism for mentoring (e.g., Chan, 2008),\nbut have not provided data on story content, functions, or prac-\ntices. This study satisfies at least part of that need. It suggests\nthat stories are one way that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s learn with the stories serv-\ning learning, emotional support, and/or career progression func-\ntions of mentoring. This exploratory study demonstrates that\nstorytelling is, indeed, a powerful and effective mode and\nmethod of mentoring.\nAppendix\nSemistructured Interview Protocol\n1.

It will help to ensure that we are on the\nsame page when we discuss your experiences . . .\nMentoring has been defined as a partnership or a developmental\ninteraction in which a senior colleague (the mentor) provides\nsupport and guidance to a junior colleague (the mentee) for the\nmentee's personal/professional growth. The mentor is usually\nfocused on giving the mentee learning, career development, and/\nor emotional support through a variety of behaviors such as\ncoaching, goal-setting, role modeling, encouraging, and\nsocializing or orienting the mentee to the company or industry.\nOftentimes, the mentor is senior to the mentee, but s/he can be\non the same hierarchical level (peer mentoring), junior to the\nmentor (reverse mentoring), or part of a group of mentors (group\nmentoring) (D'Abate, Eddy, & Tannenbaum, 2003; Eby, Rhodes,\n& Allen, 2007; Eddy, D'Abate, Tannenbaum, Givens-Skeaton,\nDoes that make sense to you? Do you see the mentoring rela-\ntionship differently? If so, how?\n6. Given that definition, please think of someone that\nyou mentor (if they do not mentor someone [or have\nnot in the past], go to Question 7). No names please.\nDoes this person work at the same company that you\ndo? Do you mentor them through a formal mentoring\nprogram or informally? If informal, how did your\nrelationship develop? Is there a particular story you\nhave told your mentee? You might have told this\nstory to help them understand a point you were trying\nto make, to teach them something, to share your\nexpertise, or some other reason. Please describe this\nstory in detail. Why did you tell your mentee this\nstory? Is this story based on your own personal expe-\nrience? If not, where did you hear this story? Did you\nmake it up? Do you think telling this story helped\nyour mentee? How so? What do you want your men-\ntee to remember or learn from this story?\n7. Okay, let us go back to the definition of mentoring\n(see above). Now, think of someone who has men-\ntored you (if you have not been a mentee, then go to\nend). Again, no names please. Can you recall a story\nthat your mentor told you as part of your mentoring\nrelationship or interactions? Please describe the story\nin detail. How did you feel after hearing this story?\nWhat did you learn from this story, how did it affect/\nhelp you, and how did you apply these lessons learned\ntoward your career?\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAlleman, E., & Clarke, D.
