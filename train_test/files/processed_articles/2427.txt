Our results indicate the salience of both\npeer selection and peer influence effects for friendship tie choice and adolescent drinking\nbehavior. Concurrently, the main effect models indicate that parental monitoring and the pa-\nrental home drinking environment affected adolescent alcohol use in the small school sam-\nple, and that parental home drinking environment affected adolescent drinking in the large\nschool sample. In the small school sample, we detect an interaction between the parental\nhome drinking environment and choosing friends that drink as they multiplicatively affect\nfriendship tie choice. Our findings suggest that future research should investigate the syner-\ngistic effects of both peer and parental influences for adolescent friendship tie choices and\ndrinking behavior. And given the tendency of adolescents to form ties with their friends'\nfriends, and the evidence of local hierarchy in these networks, popular youth who do not\ndrink may be uniquely positioned and uniquely salient as the highest rank of the hierarchy to\ncause anti-drinking peer influences to diffuse down the social hierarchy to less popular\nyouth. As such, future interventions should harness prosocial peer influences simultaneous-\nly with strategies to increase parental support and monitoring among parents to promote af-\nfiliation with prosocial peers.\nCitation: Wang C, Hipp JR, Butts CT, Jose R, Lakon\nCM (2015) Alcohol Use among Adolescent Youth:\nThe Role of Friendship Networks and Family Factors\nin Multiple School Studies.

Recent reports find that 71% of 9th- to 12th-\ngrade students indicate having had at least one drink of alcohol (other than a few sips) during\ntheir lifetime, with about one fifth of them starting to drink by age 13 [1]. The high prevalence\nof underage drinkers, and early initiation into drinking practices, has led to decades of research\non the consequences of adolescent alcohol use. Studies have linked adolescent drinking to\nother adolescent problem behaviors, including automobile accidents [2,3,4,6], drug abuse\n[3,4,8], engagement in risky sexual activities [2,3,4], school absenteeism [3,9], and poor or fail-\ning grades [3,4,5,7]. Thus, despite the declining rates of alcohol use among youth, adolescent\ndrinking remains a key agenda item for the public health community to address.\nEcological models [10,11] suggest that multiple contextual influences shape adolescent de-\nvelopment and health behavior. Adolescence is a critical time period during which various con-\ntextual influences--including those exerted by youths' friends and parents prominently as the\nprimary socialization forces--affecting adolescent development and their health behavior. The-\noretical intuition from ecological models suggests that both peer and parental influences might\nact both independently and in synergy as they impact the simultaneous processes of adolescent\nfriendship tie choice and adolescent drinking.\nPeer networks are a salient reference group for youth, with peers playing a particularly im-\nportant and influential role in helping shape adolescents' evolving social worlds [12]. Various\ncharacteristics of adolescent peer networks are salient for youths' friendship tie choices. Reci-\nprocity among adolescent friendship pairs is a strong force affecting friendship tie formation\namong adolescent youth [13]. Indicators of degree, including in-degree centrality which is the\npopularity of an actor in a network [14], and in-in degree assortativity, which is the tendency\nto choose network actors who are similarly popular, are important for friendship tie selection,\nas popular youth may have many options for forming friendships, and likewise may be more\nlikely to choose similarly popular friends. Another degree based network indicator, out-degree,\nis an indicator of the number of ties a network actor sends [14], and reflects an actor's expan-\nsiveness in the network. Adolescents who send out more friendship tie nominations are salient\nin a network. In addition, the number of transitive triplets and three-cycles, which reflect local\nhierarchy in a network, are likely important for friendship tie choice as youth occupying posi-\ntions in these triadic structures have an opportunity to influence one another, likely on multi-\nple dimensions including on friendship tie choices.\nIn addition to shaping adolescents' friendship tie choices, peer networks also shape adoles-\ncent drinking behavior. Two important socialization processes operating in peer networks are\npeer influence and peer selection. Peer influence is the process wherein youth alter their behav-\nior such that it aligns with that of their peers. Peer selection is the process by which youth select\nfriends who are similar to themselves, on various dimensions. Adolescent alcohol use can be\nconceptualized as a result of both peer influence and selection processes, with friends influenc-\ning one another's drinking behavior and adolescents selecting friends who engage in similar\nlevels of drinking [15\u00ad20]. And in-degree popularity has also been positively related to adoles-\ncent drinking behavior across studies [21\u00ad24].\nStochastic Actor-Based (SAB) models [25,26] have offered keen insights into adolescent al-\ncohol use, allowing researchers to disentangle peer selection and peer influence effects. These\ndynamic models estimate friendship tie choice and drinking behavior changes simultaneously.\nOne study found both selection (i.e., \"birds of a feather\" or homophily effects) and influence\n(i.e., social contagion) effects for drinking behavior when using longitudinal data of youth in\nthe West of Scotland [27]. Similar studies based on longitudinal data collected in Netherlands\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nrole in study design, data collection and analysis,\ndecision to publish,or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n[28], Italy [29], Finland [30], and Sweden [31] also found both selection and influence processes\nunderlying adolescent drinking behavior similarity. The first study to utilize the SAB modeling\nstrategy to examine the drinking behavior among adolescents in the United States was Mundt,\nMercken, and Zakletskaia [32], using two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent to Adult Health (AddHealth), a nationally representative survey of US adoles-\ntional studies, Mundt, Mercken, and Zakletskaia [32] found only a significant selection effect\nbut no influence effect for alcohol use. A study utilizing data from 450 15-to-17 year-old stu-\ndents attending a public high school in the Northeastern United States between 2004 and 2006\nshowed the opposite effect, with only a significant peer influence effect on alcohol use [33].\nMoreover, a third study, using the PROSPER dataset--which followed 13,214 6th-to-9th grade\nreported both significant influence and selection effects for drinking behavior similarity [34].\nParents are also influential referents in adolescents' social worlds, affecting both adolescent\nfriendship tie choices and their drinking behavior. Parents exert influences on the socialization\nof adolescent youth through multiple processes, including the provision of social support and\nparental monitoring. Indeed, parental influences have a critical impact on adolescent develop-\nment, particularly in the area of building youths' social competence regarding friendship for-\nmation. One study indicated that familial factors are associated with social competence, peer\nacceptance, and the ability to form and maintain close friendships among youth [35]. More-\nover, theoretical guidance from Social Control Theory [36,37] casts parental monitoring as a\nkey process deterring youth from affiliating with delinquent peers, which may then act to lessen\nthe probability that youth begin using substances such as alcohol. As such, parents may affect\nthe likelihood that their adolescent children will select friends who drink. A recent cross-\nsectional study examining adolescent substance use suggested that youth reared in families\ncharacterized by a lack of familial obligations, emotional closeness, and support, were more\nlikely to affiliate with substance using peers, and that moreover, having these peer relationships\nwas associated with more substance use [38]. To the extent that parents are successful at moni-\ntoring their children, the adolescent child may have less opportunity to associate with friends\nwho drink, as parents may prohibit friendships with other youth who drink or prohibit their\nadolescent children from being in situations which present opportunities to drink [39]. It is\ntherefore possible that parents' characteristics might interact with youths' friendship selection\nas both factors may impact one another in relation to adolescent friendship networks.\nPast studies also demonstrate that parental influences affect adolescent drinking behavior\ndirectly. Previous research indicates that parental support prevents the early initiation of alco-\nhol use and reduces the frequency of alcohol use among adolescents [40,41,42]. Moreover, pa-\nrental monitoring and supervision have been negatively associated with adolescent alcohol use\n[19,43]. Not all parental influences, however, are protective for alcohol use, as youth in homes\nin which parents drink or parents display high levels of permissiveness for adolescent drinking\nare more likely to increase their alcohol use levels over time [44,45,46].\nIt is possible that peer and parental influences may function together in impacting adoles-\ncent friendship tie choices and drinking behavior, given insights from ecological models of de-\nvelopment suggesting that influences from these two contexts may act synergistically [10]. In a\nstudy of 4,230 7th to 12th graders, parental drug (including binge drinking) attitudes had an in-\ndirect effect on the risk of adolescent drug use, which was mediated through peer drug use\n[47]. In another study, Marshal and Chassin [48] found that parental support and discipline\nbuffered the effects of peer group affiliation on alcohol use of female adolescents. It may be that\nparental attitudes and behavior relevant to monitoring, support, and parental drinking operate\nsynergistically with youths' affiliations with peers who use alcohol in affecting youths'\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nfriendship tie choices. Having said that, extant studies have not systematically examined these\nparental influences as they affect the co-evolving processes of friendship tie choice behavior\nand alcohol use among adolescents, nor have they examined the interactions under study. As\nsuch, whereas past studies have found a positive peer influence effect on adolescent alcohol use\n[15\u00ad20], the current study goes a step further to examine whether youth whose parents engage\nin close monitoring or provide strong emotional support, or have a home environment con-\ndoning drinking behavior, are more or less likely to adopt the drinking behavior of their friends\nthrough a peer influence effect on their own drinking behavior. Secondly, the current study\nalso assesses whether parental support, parental monitoring, and the parental home drinking\nenvironment interact with whether youth choose friends who drink as both factors might mul-\ntiplicatively affect youths' friendship tie choice.\nFinally, we also examine the effect of depressive symptoms among adolescents on their alco-\nhol use. Adolescent drinking has been positively related to depression in previous studies\n[23,49\u00ad53]. Depressive symptoms in adolescent youth have also been related to youths' friend-\nship tie choice behavior [54]. As such, we examine the role of depressive symptoms as they re-\nlate to adolescent drinking behavior.\nThe current study builds upon extant literature examining the importance of peer influence\nand selection processes related to adolescent friendship tie choice and alcohol use. In addition,\nwe also focus on the role of key parental influences on adolescent friendship tie choice and al-\ncohol use behavior. With data from the AddHealth study, we explore the co-evolution of ado-\nlescents' friendship ties and their drinking behavior over two waves. We hypothesize that we\nwill observe both peer influence and peer selection effects, as adolescents will select friends\nwith similar alcohol use levels, and adjust their drinking behavior based on the drinking behav-\nior of their friends. We also expect that parental monitoring, parental support, and the parental\nhome drinking environment, will influence the friendship tie choice and adolescent drinking,\nboth directly and synergistically.\nData and Methods\nData\nThe data utilized in this study come from early waves of AddHealth. The respondent record/\ninformation was anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. This study has been approved\nby the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Irvine (2013). This study\ndoes not employ human subjects directly, as our analyses utilize secondary data which are de-\nidentified. AddHealth participants provided written informed consent for participation in all\naspects of AddHealth in accordance with the University of North Carolina School of Public\nHealth Institutional Review Board guidelines that are based on the Code of Federal Regulations\non the Protection of Human Subjects 45CFR46: http://www.hhs.\ngov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html. Written informed consent was given by par-\nticipants (or next of kin/caregiver) for their answers to be used in this study.\nAddHealth is a longitudinal study of a stratified sample of US schools from 7th to 12th grades\n[55]. The AddHealth data is one of the richest adolescent network data sources collected to date\nin the United States. The network boundary is defined by a meaningful social and policy-relevant\nunit, the school, with information on basic demographics (i.e., gender, race, age), attitudes and\nbehaviors, and ecological structures (i.e., family, school, neighborhood), as well as on all friend-\nship relations. Thus these data are ideal for examining the co-evolution of friendship networks\nand drinking behavior in school based contexts. Although the AddHealth data were collected\nnearly 20 years ago, these data continue to be relevant to the mechanisms of in-school friendship\nformation, and continue to be widely used in current public health studies [32,56\u00ad62].\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nAddHealth contains a saturated sample of 16 schools out of the total 132 participant schools\n[55]. Among the 16 schools, there is a special education school with constant student turnover,\nand another school with an administrative error in which the students' IDs at the earlier wave\ncould not be matched with those at later waves. Thus these two schools are not suitable for longi-\ntudinal network analysis. Of the remaining 14 schools, two are large schools (over 1,000 students\nenrolled) often called \"Jefferson High\" and \"Sunshine High\" [56,63] whose macro settings were\nquite different from the other 12 small schools with fewer than 200 students enrolled [64,65].\n(Among the twelve small schools, network size, or number of respondents, is between 30 and 197.\nThe mean is 107 and SD is 53.46.) Given computational power issues, we could not estimate the\nmodel for the biggest school, \"Sunshine High.\" Since our analysis requires longitudinal measures\nof friendship networks, we focus on two samples: 1) a saturated sampling of 1,284 students from\n12 small schools, and 2) that of 976 students from the second biggest school, \"Jefferson High\" [63].\nDuring the administration of the AddHealth survey, all students in 14 schools were invited\nto take the survey over three waves. Information on the social and demographic characteristics\nof the respondents was collected, as well as their risk behaviors including alcohol use. Adoles-\ncent sociometric networks were constructed from a network elicitation item asking respon-\ndents to name up to five male and five female best friends from a name list of students in\nhis/her school, and thus researchers are able to attain longitudinal complete sociometric net-\nworks in these schools. The measures of youths' parental contexts came from a parent survey\nbetween April and December of 1995, the same time when the respondents also took a wave 1\nIn-Home Survey. However, due to another administrative error, about 37% respondents in the\n12 small schools and about 5% respondents in \"Jefferson High\" were recorded to nominate\nonly one (instead of five) female and male best friends. To overcome this limited nomination\ndifficulty, in this study we utilize the information retrieved from the first (In-School Survey\n1996) time points for our dynamic network analysis, skipping that from the second time point\n(wave 1 In-Home Survey).\nMeasures\nThe dependent (behavior) variable measures drinking frequency in the past 12 months. At\nwave 1, the survey question was \"During the past twelve months, how often did you drink beer,\nwine, or liquor?\" with response categories of \"0--never\", \"1\u00ad1 once or twice\", \"2\u00ad2 once a\nmonth or less\", \"3\u00ad2 or 3 days a month\", \"4--once or twice a week\", \"5\u00ad3 to 5 days a week\", and\n\"6--nearly every day.\" In waves 2 and 3, the survey question was \"During the past 12 months,\non how many days did you drink alcohol?\" with response categories of \"1--every day or almost\n\"7--never\". We recoded these such that response categories specify non-drinkers (0 = never),\ncasual-drinkers (1 = 1 or 2 days), light-drinkers (2 = once a month or less or 3\u00ad12 times in the\npast 12 months), medium-drinkers (3 = 2 or 3 days a month), and heavy-drinkers (4 = more\nthan 1 or 2 days a week). (We do not have a measure of drinking intensity. The only related\nquestion asked over all three time points was \"During the past twelve months, how often did\nyou get drunk?\" However, students may interpret the number of drinks required to be \"drunk\"\nvery differently, and we therefore do not include this measure.)\nPredictors of drinking behavior include gender (0 = male, 1 = female), grade (7~12), depres-\nsive symptoms, parental support, parental monitoring, and the parental home drinking environ-\nment. Depressive symptom status is generated as a factor score of 19 ordinal items modified\nfrom the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Cronbach's  = 0.87) [66].\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nParental support and parental monitoring are computed as standardized factor scores\n(means = 0, standard deviations = 1) through confirmatory factor analysis, with Root Mean\nSquared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) about. 05 and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) greater\nthan. 95, which both suggest a good fit. Items indicating parental support include whether the\nstudent had talked about a personal problem with their parents (0 = no, 1 = yes), whether the\nparents and the student communicated well, whether the parents were warm and loving, wheth-\ner the student reported a \"good relationship\" with parents (same response categories for three\nitems above: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree,\n5 = strongly agree), the student's closeness to their parents, and how much the student felt his or\nher parents cared about him or her (same response categories for two items above: 1 = not at all,\n2 = very little, 3 = somewhat, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = very much). Items indicating parental monitor-\ning include whether parents let the student make decisions about a weekend curfew, the people\nthe student hung around with, how much television the student watched, which television pro-\ngram the student watched, and what the week night bedtime was (0 = yes, 1 = no), and the pres-\nence of parents when the student was back from school (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = some\nof the time, 3 = most of the time, 4 = always, 5 = they brought the student home from school),\neating dinner (0~7 days per week), and going to bed (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = some of\nthe time, 3 = most of the time, 4 = always). Home drinking environment is measured by sum-\nming up two binary measures (0 = no, 1 = yes): parental drinking was coded as \"yes\" if the par-\nent reported that they drank at least once a month, and alcohol availability was coded as \"yes\" if\nthe adolescent respondents reported positively that \"alcohol is easily available at home\".\nPlan of Analysis\nTo explore the co-evolution of friendship networks and drinking behavior in continuous Mar-\nkov time, we utilize the SAB model with the R-based Simulation Investigation for Empirical\nNetwork Analysis (RSiena) package [67]. The SAB model assumes that a respondent will make\ndecisions that optimize his or her network and behavior status in the next time step based on\nhis or her current state of network-behavioral configuration, which is referred to as the objec-\ntive function. The objective function is defined as f(,x) = Sk\nk\nSik\n(x), where k\nis the kth esti-\nmated parameter for the actor-specific effect sik\n(x) and x is the joint network-behavioral state.\nPositive values of the objective function indicate the preferred direction of changes, while nega-\ntive values suggest the avoidance of such changes. In RSiena, the objective function of network\nchanges and behavior changes are estimated simultaneously to generate both a network and a\nbehavioral equation. Together, these constitute a set of interdependent equations with the rate\nfunctions i\n(,x), which indicate the expected frequency of changes in the networks or behav-\nior the actors make between observation points. The model is then estimated by simulating the\nnetworks and behavior forward in time. Thus, there are many micro-steps in the model in\nwhich actors update their objective functions regarding alcohol use behavior and network tie\nchoice. A Method of moments (MoM) estimation is used to estimate the network and behavior\nparameters such that the main characteristics of the networks and behaviors are most\nclosely approximated.\nAs shown in Table 1, in the network equation predicting friendship tie choice, we include\nseveral structural network effects, i.e., out-degree and reciprocity capturing tie preference, tran-\nsitive triplets and three cycles measuring triadic closure, and in-degree popularity and in-in de-\ngree assortativity (square root) differentiating the tendency towards preferential attachment vs.\ndegree assortativity [68,69]. The network equation (friendship tie choice) also controls for sim-\nilarity measures, including similarity on gender, grade, and parent education level (as a proxy\nof family socio-economic status). The function of parental influences on friendship tie choice is\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\ntested by the inclusion of respondents' parental support, parental monitoring, and their paren-\ntal home drinking environment. For the behavior variable alcohol use (z), we specify it as a\nmain effect on alter attractiveness (drinking alter), as a main effect on network activity of ego\n(drinking ego), and as a similarity (homophily) effect.\nAs shown in Table 2, in the drinking behavior equation, the linear and quadratic shape pa-\nrameters model the long-term trend in alcohol use. The in-degree item measures whether ado-\nlescents receiving more in-coming ties (more popular) drank more over time. We measure the\npeer influence effect as the sum of negative absolute difference between ego's and alters' behav-\nior averaged by ego's out-degree. Additional covariates such as gender, grade, and depressive\nsymptoms are controlled to test how the parental factors--i.e., parental home drinking envi-\nronment, parental support, and parental monitoring--affected adolescent drinking in Model 1.\nWhereas Model 1 includes all the measures described (the \"main effects\" model), Models 2\nthrough 4 assess the moderating role of an adolescent's parental factors. Thus, we included\nTable 2.

Likewise, in these same models we included interaction terms of friends' influence effect\n(peer influence) with parental support, parental monitoring, and the parental home drinking\nenvironment in Models 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\nIt should be noted that when the interaction between parental support and friends' influence\nwas added to the behavior equation of Model 2 for the 12 small schools, many of the effects\nwere dramatically inconsistent with that in Model 1, 3, and 4: both their parameters and stan-\ndard errors appear to be magnified (as shown in the shaded area of S1 Table). A further exami-\nnation of the correlations among the parameters suggests collinearity issues due to this specific\ninteraction effect. We therefore removed this interaction from the behavior equation of Model\n2 for the 12 small schools. We have also tried estimating a Model 5 for each sample, with all po-\ntential moderators included in the same SAB model. However, due to the high collinearity\namong these interaction effects, the model cannot reach convergence.\nThere are various approaches to combining multiple networks, including a meta-analysis ap-\nproach and combining different sub-projects into one multi-group project with rate parameters al-\nlowed to differ across sub-projects. In this study we followed Cheadle and Goosby [64] and\nCheadle and Schwadel [65] to explore the general tendency of the network and behavior dynamics\nin the 12 small schools by combining their friendship networks into one large network and using\nstructural zeroes to indicate that ties between the schools are not permitted (see [67], page 81).\nAlthough we aimed to explore the general tendency of network and behavior dynamics in\nthe 12 small schools, we also considered possible variations across schools along several key di-\nmensions: (1) urban, suburban vs. rural, (2) public vs. private, (3) single race vs. multiple race,\nand (4) different response rates. For the first three dimensions, we estimated ancillary models\nincluding interactions between dummy variables for these contextual variables and key drink-\ning effects. They were insignificant, suggesting that co-evolution of friendship tie choice and\ndrinking behavior was similar across different types of schools (e.g., see S2 Table along with S1\nFile). Among the 12 small schools, 10 had response rates above 70% and 2 had response rates\nbetween 55%~70%. To account for the influence from response rate, we ran ancillary models\nwith friendship networks of the 10 small schools combined into one large network and com-\npared the results with those from the 12 small schools. The parameters were quite similar in\nthese separate models. These results are available from the authors upon request.\nIn this way we can list the results of the 12 small schools and \"Jefferson High\" side by side to\nobserve their similarities and differences. Respondents showing up at either an early or later\nobservation point are included in the analysis. They were also allowed to join or leave their net-\nworks (e.g., graduates, movers, dropouts), with structural zeroes indicating they were no longer\nthere at this time point (see [67,70]). Missing data are handled by RSiena software and imputed\nwithin the models as Huisman and Steglich [71], and Ripley, Snijders, Boda, V\u00f6r\u00f6s, and Pre-\nciado [67] suggested. We assessed the goodness-of-fit of the models by comparing network sta-\ntistics and drinking distribution of 1,000 simulations based on our model to the observed\nnetwork and the fit was quite good (e.g., see S1 and S2 Figs. along with S2 File).\nResults\nDescriptive Results\nThe alcohol use and network descriptive statistics of the 12 small schools and \"Jefferson High\"\nare summarized in Table 3. (The distribution of drinking behavior in each of 12 small schools\nis shown in S3 Table.) Among the small school sample, 52% students reported they were non-\ndrinkers during the In-School Survey, and this proportion increased to 61.1% during the wave\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\n2 In-Home Survey. Although the number of non-drinkers also increased in \"Jefferson High\", as\nsuggested by the proportion of light- (2 = once a month or less or 3\u00ad12 times in the past 12\nmonths), medium- (3 = 2 or 3 days a month), and heavy-drinkers (4 = more than 1 or 2 days a\nweek), drinking was a far more prevalent behavior in this school than in small schools. The\ngroup size of casual-drinkers (1 = 1 or 2 days) decreased in both samples, and their members\neither became non-drinkers, or chose to increase their drinking frequency to other levels.\nAmong the 1,284 respondents in the 12 small schools, the number of out-going ties de-\ndue to graduation, moving, dropping out, and attrition/non-response/missing network data.\nA similar pattern was also observed in \"Jefferson High\". The proportional change of reciprocal\nties was more variable in the small schools (from 0.45 to 0.33). The transitivity index, which\ncaptures the tendency for individuals to experience triadic closure, was found to be relatively\nstable over time, although stronger in small schools (34%) compared to \"Jefferson High\"\n(18~20%). As indicated by the Jaccard index, there was a high turnover of friendship ties in\nboth samples, with only 21~22% of ties persisting over the two waves.\nThe descriptive statistics of covariates are reported in Table 4.\nNetwork Evolution: Friendship Tie Choice\nAs shown in the network equation of Model 1 in Table 5 and Table 6, we observe significantly\npositive parameters for drinking similarity in both samples, although the estimated parameter\np <. 05). These provide evidence of a peer selection effect, as students were more likely to select\nas friends others with similar levels of alcohol use.\nIn both samples we also find that those drinking more frequently were more popular than\nthose drinking less frequently, although they seemed to be even appealing in small schools\n(b = .28, p <. 05) compared to \"Jefferson High\" (b = .11, p <. 01). Adolescents having higher\ndrinking levels were inclined to nominate fewer best friends that those with lower drinking lev-\nels, but this effect is only significant in \"Jefferson High\" (b = -.08, p <. 05).\nTable 3.

The Jaccard index measures the network stability between successive waves.\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nIn terms of structural network effects, the significantly negative out-degree (b = -2.09,\np <. 001 in small schools and b = -2.51, p <. 001 in \"Jefferson High\") and the significantly posi-\nson High\") suggest that adolescents in both samples tended to form fewer ties, but when they\ndid such ties were more likely to be reciprocal ones. The adolescents also preferred to be friends\nwith their friends' friends (triadic closure), as indicated by the positive transitive triplets effect\nnegative three-cycle effect implies a tendency toward local hierarchy (b = -.14, p <. 01 in small\nschools and b = -.43, p <. 001 in \"Jefferson High\"). Adolescents were more likely to be named\nas a tie if they already had many in-coming ties (high in-degree popularity) (b = .07, p <. 001\nin small schools and b = .04, p <. 05 in \"Jefferson High\"). And the negative parameter for in-in\ndegree assortativity (square root) again suggests the presence of preferential attachment as ado-\nlescents with high in-degree were more likely to be nominated as best friends by those with low\nin-degree, but this effect is only significant in the small school sample (b = -.07, p <. 01).\nWe find that homophily preferences in gender and grade drove friendship tie formation: ad-\nolescents were more likely to send friendship nominations to other adolescents with the same\nhomophily effects of parental educational levels are insignificant in both samples, after control-\nling for the other measures in the model.\nAs for how the parental influences affected friendship tie choice, we find that adolescents\nwho received more parental support nominate more friends in the 12 small schools (b = .35,\np <. 001). This effect for parental support was insignificant in \"Jefferson High\". And we find\nthat more parental monitoring and a home drinking environment did not affect tie choice.\nWhen focusing on the moderating effect of family contexts on friendship tie choice in Mod-\nels 2 to 4 of Tables 5 and 6, although the signs of interaction parameters are as expected, the\nonly statistically significant effect is that between the parental home drinking environment and\ndrinking alter in the small school sample (b = .18, p <. 05): whereas higher-level drinkers were\nTable 4. Descriptive statistics of covariates.\nGrade level (%)\nParent education level (%)\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nmore popular in general, those with high levels of drinking in their home environment were\nparticularly likely to form ties with those who drink more, see Fig. 1.\nBehavior Evolution: Alcohol use\nAs shown in the behavior equation of Model 1 in Table 5 and Table 6, we find a significant peer\ninfluence effect (b = .22, p <. 05 in the small schools and b = .36, p <. 05 in \"Jefferson High\"),\nTable 5.

Additional significant effects were found for grade in small schools (b = .03,\np <. 05) and gender in \"Jefferson High\" (b = -.09, p <. 01): higher-grade adolescents in the 12\nsmall schools and males in \"Jefferson High\" were generally found to increase their drinking fre-\nquency over time more than their counterparts.\nRegarding the parental influences, we find that adolescents who experienced more drinking\nat home were more likely to increase their own drinking frequency (b = .10, p <. 001 in small\nschools and b = .06, p <. 05 in \"Jefferson High\"). Adolescents with higher levels of parental\nmonitoring engaged in less drinking behavior over time, but this effect is only significant in\nsmall school sample (b = -.39, p <. 05). The parental support respondents received had a nega-\ntive effect on the frequency of adolescent drinking, although not significant in either case.\nTurning to the interaction effects included in Model 2 to Model 4 of Table 5 and Table 6,\nthere was no evidence that parental support, parental monitoring, or the parental home drink-\ning environment moderated the peer influence effect in either sample.\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to disentangle peer selection and peer influence processes and other key net-\nwork effects simultaneously with salient parental influences by examining the co-evolution of\nfriendship tie choices and drinking behavior among adolescents in two AddHealth samples. Be-\ncause the network size and drinking prevalence were relatively different in the two samples--\ne.g., Jefferson High was a much larger school with intensive adolescent alcohol use--one might\npresume that the co-evolution mechanisms of friendship tie choices and drinking behavior\nwould differ. Our models demonstrate that to the contrary, the evidence across the two samples\nwas typically quite similar. In the friendship tie choice equation, most measures had effects sim-\nilar in direction and statistical significance. The differences were mostly in magnitude of the ef-\nfects: in the friendship tie choice equation, whereas the network structural effects such as\nreciprocity, transitive triplets, and three-cycles were larger in \"Jefferson High\", the popularity of\nheavier drinkers and the selection effect of choosing ties based on similarity of drinking behav-\nior were smaller in \"Jefferson High\". The effect of peer influence was stronger in \"Jefferson\nFig 1. Interaction of home drinking environment ego and drinking alter on tie choice in Model 4 for the\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nHigh\" with more drinking behavior, implying that such a context may be particularly important\nfor transmitting norms about drinking behavior among adolescents. The most notable differ-\nences were that in small schools with lower levels of alcohol use, parental support had a much\nstronger effect on friendship tie choice, the parental home drinking environment had a much\nstronger effect on forming ties with those who drink more, and parental monitoring appeared\nmore effective in reducing drinking behavior.\nOur findings demonstrate that peer selection played a significant role in facilitating drinking\nbehavior similarity in the adolescents' friendship networks. Adolescents preferred to form\nfriendships with those who displayed similar levels of alcohol use. These results support previ-\nous findings regarding the importance of peer selection in accounting for behavioral similari-\nties across dyads in friendship networks [32,34]. At the same time, our findings also indicate\nthe important role of peer influence in friendship networks, as do previous studies [33,34],\ndemonstrating the importance of peer influence in adolescent networks. Overall, our findings\nsuggest that both peer and parental factors were instrumental in shaping both friendship tie\nchoice and drinking behavior.\nRegarding our findings pertaining to friendship tie choice, we observe that heavy-drinkers re-\nceived more in-coming ties and hence were more popular. Also using data from the AddHealth\nIn-School survey, Balsa, Homer, French, and Norton [21] found that popularity (also measured\nas ego's in-degree) was positively associated with drinking frequency. However, they acknowl-\nedged that their cross-sectional design prevented them from assessing the causal ordering or the\nextent that a reciprocated relationship existed between these two measures [21]. Our findings\nsuggest a unilateral relationship between alcohol use and network popularity: whereas alcohol\nuse increased popularity, more popular adolescents did not drink more over time.\nOur findings also suggest that while adolescents' peer relationships were central to their\nlives, parents still had influence on both adolescent alcohol use and friendship tie choice. First,\nin line with previous studies [44,45,46], adolescents were more likely to engage in underage\ndrinking if the parents provided a favorable environment for adolescent alcohol use. In our\nstudy, these respondents in such family environments were not only particularly likely to form\nfriendship ties with adolescents with high drinking levels, but our model implies that through\npeer influence they would over time engage in higher levels of alcohol use.\nWe also observed a negative relationship between parental monitoring and drinking in the\nsmall school sample. Our finding is consistent with prior studies indicating a negative relation-\nship between parental monitoring and adolescent drinking behavior [19,43]. That parental\nmonitoring is risk protective for substance use has been shown in these studies, which highlight\nthe continuing role of parents in enforcing rules and discipline during the high school years\nhelped reduce the alcohol use level among adolescents, at least in the small school sample.\nOur findings also indicated a negative relationship between parental support and alcohol use.\nThis finding is consistent with past studies indicating a negative relationship between parental\nsupport and drinking behavior [40,41,42]. It is likely that the provision of parental support ren-\nders adolescents more able to develop social competencies necessary to form friendship ties.\nOur findings differ from a previous study using Add Health [32] that did not find a signifi-\ncant influence effect. There are several reasons for these different results. First, there is different\nsample selection, as our study utilizes data from the In-School Survey and the wave 2 In-Home\nsurvey, but not data from the wave 1 In-Home Survey to avoid difficulty due to limited nomi-\nnations, whereas Mundt and colleagues [32] selected respondents from the wave 1 In-Home\nsurvey and the wave 2 In-Home Survey. Second, our study includes respondents present in ei-\nther wave, whereas Mundt and colleagues [32] only included those who completed the survey\nat the first time point (assuming those not completing the survey are not part of the network).\nThird, our study integrates parental factors into the friendship tie choice and drinking\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nequations, which had important effects in the models. Fourth, we utilized a different strategy\nfor handling multiple networks, as we combined the friendship networks of the 12 small\nschools into one large network, whereas Mundt and colleagues [32] employed a meta-analysis.\nFinally, we utilized a different peer influence specification. Each of these factors likely contrib-\nutes to the differences in results across these two studies.\nOur study has several limitations. First, all the analyses are based on self-reported data from\nAddHealth. One consequence of using self-reports of illicit substance use is underreporting.\nSome studies find that adolescent reporting is better than parent, peer, or other reporting [72].\nStill, future studies may benefit by using multiple measures of alcohol use (e.g. employing phys-\niological or biological indicators of alcohol use) to ensure high internal validity [73]. Second,\nthe friendship networks were retrieved through a name generator limited to a maximum of five\nmale and five female best friends and thus were not a fully accurate portrayal of a respondent's\npeer network. It is unclear how our findings would have differed had the adolescents sampled\nbeen allowed to nominate all of their friends. Third, the AddHealth data did not include infor-\nmation on alcohol use behavior of other family members, i.e., respondents' brothers and sisters.\nIt would be much better for future studies to account for various levels of familial influences.\nDespite these limitations, our findings have implications for future studies. Our findings\nsuggest merit in further examination of the role of the parental influences under study as they\naffect co-evolution of friendship networks and drinking behavior among US adolescents, as\nwell as the mechanisms underlying the relationship between alcohol use and network populari-\nty. Given that those in a home environment which favored drinking were particularly likely to\nform friendship ties with higher-drinking-level adolescents suggests a need to study this possi-\nbility more closely.\nOur findings also have practical implications for health behavior change interventions tar-\ngeting adolescent alcohol use. Motivated by intuition from intervention studies applying con-\ncepts from the opinion leader literature [74,75] employing the general strategy of identifying\npopular youth as means to transmit prosocial peer influences through a network system, we\nsuggest that one way to promote positive peer influences against drinking and to likewise\ndampen the influence of drinkers in peer networks is to target popular youth who do not drink\nand are connected through transitive triplets. Given the hierarchical structuring of our data (as\nindicated by the significantly positive transitive triplet and significantly negative three cycle ef-\nfect), popular youth are uniquely positioned, and as well uniquely salient in the highest rank of\nthe hierarchy. Peer influences exerted by popular youth will likely diffuse down the social hier-\narchy to less popular youth. In addition, given the salience of reciprocated ties among adoles-\ncent youth, another intervention strategy would target mutually reciprocated friendship pairs\nof youth (i.e., drinking pairs, non-drinking pairs, and mixed drinking status pairs) to promote\nanti-drinking peer influences, social support, and resistance training skills to influence one an-\nother to stop drinking or not begin drinking. Lastly, parents should be targeted to both increase\ntheir capacity to provide support to and monitoring of their adolescent children, in order to\nhelp their children foster friendships with prosocial peers who are not substance users.\nConclusion\nIn sum, this study examined the co-evolution of friendship networks and drinking behavior\namong two representative samples of US adolescents. Adolescents with similar alcohol use lev-\nels were more likely to form friendships than their peers with more dissimilar alcohol use lev-\nels, and adolescents also adjusted their drinking behavior to match that of their best friends.\nMoreover, we found that those who drank more were more popular, but popular adolescents\ndid not drink more over time. Our findings also indicate that the parental home drinking\nAlcohol Use among Adolescent Youth\nenvironment had a positive effect on adolescent drinking over time. Overall, our findings sug-\ngest in the importance of disentangling the effects of friendship networks and family contexts\nwhen trying to understand the co-evolution of adolescent friendship tie choice and alcohol use.\nFuture studies should further explore the risk and protective aspects of these peer and parental\nenvironments for adolescent alcohol use.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Fig. GOF Testing of SAB Model 1 for Jefferson High.\nS2 Fig. GOF Testing of SAB Model 1 for 12 small schools.\nS1 File.
