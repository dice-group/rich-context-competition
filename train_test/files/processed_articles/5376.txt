Understanding\nthe reasons for government spending growth has been a central concern of public sector economists. This is due to the fact\nthat most economies of the world have consistently had increased government expenditures. Nigeria is not an exception.\nThere is need to ascertain the determinants of size of government expenditure in Nigeria. Short-Run Error Correction\nModel and long-run static equation were used for comparing the influence of those variables on the size of government\nspending. The long-run static equation served as a test to compare short-run dynamics with the long-run relationships.\nOrdinary least squares (OLS estimation technique was used. The stationarity tests showed that none of the variables was\nstationary at level form, but only after their first difference. The results of this study show that the size of revenue and\ngrowth rate of national income (output) and private investment significantly influence the size of public expenditure both in\nthe short run and long run. External and domestic debts significantly influence the size of government expenditure only in\nthe short run. It is recommended that the revenue base should be expanded; conducive environment should be created for\nprivate investment to thrive, and debt accumulation should be reduced and used for stabilization only in the short run. The\nconclusion to draw from this study is that revenue, private investment, and income boost public spending while public debts\nmight be counterproductive.\n",

According to Bergstrom\nand Goodman (1973), the costs of providing these goods and\nservices are borne by the community and the demand for\nthem is decided collectively. Many developing countries are\ncurrently undergoing substantial macroeconomic and struc-\ntural adjustment. Whether or not such programs are affecting\ngovernment expenditure and hence longer term economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction is still not clear. Fiscal opera-\ntions of governments, especially of developing countries, are\ncrucial because public expenditures provide channels for\ntheir growth.\nThe link between public expenditure and economic\ngrowth has attracted considerable interest on the part of eco-\nnomic researchers both at the theoretical and empirical lev-\nels. Roughly speaking, one may distinguish between two\nopposing views: On one hand, there is the Keynesian\napproach according to which government spending is an\nimportant policy tool to be used to ensure a reasonable level\nof economic activity, correct short-term cyclical fluctuations\nin aggregate expenditure (Singh & Sahni, 1984), and secure\nan increase in productive investment, thus providing a\nsocially optimal direction for growth and development (Ram,\n1986). The opposite view is that excessive state intervention\nin economic life affects growth performance in a negative\nway for two reasons: First, because government operations\nare often conducted less efficiently, they reduce the overall\nproductivity of the economic system; second, because exces-\nsive government expenditure (usually accompanied by high\ntaxation levels) distorts economic incentives and results in\nsub-optimal economic decisions (Barro, 1990; King &\nUnderstanding the reasons for government spending\ngrowth has been a central concern of public sector\n1University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nEzebuilo Romanus Ukwueze, Department of Economics, University of\nEmail: ezebuilo.ukwueze@unn.edu.ng\nDeterminants of the Size of\nPublic Expenditure in Nigeria\nEzebuilo Romanus Ukwueze1\n Keywords\nstationarity, revenue size, public expenditure, Phillips\u00adPeron, Wagner's law\n2 SAGE Open\neconomists going back at least as far as Wagner (1893) and\nbeginning in more recent times with Downs (1957). An\n\"excessive\" size of government is often alleged to be the\ncause of many economic ills in both developed and devel-\noping countries, including slow economic growth, large\ngovernment deficits, internal imbalances, and external\nimbalances. Studies have given many factors that necessi-\ntate the rise in government expenditure as foreign aid\npopulations and urbanization (Shelton, 2007), political\nregimes and institutions (Milesi-Ferretti, Perotti, &\nNigeria has consistently had deficit spending over the\nyears without equivalent rate of economic growth.

He found that rate of urbanization, government\nrevenue, population density, external reserves, and type of\ngovernment jointly or individually influence public expen-\nditure on infrastructure in Nigeria. Adebayo, Adebusuyi,\nand Ishola (2014) investigated the impact of public expen-\nditure on industrial growth of Nigeria and found that gov-\nernment expenditure on administration, economic services,\nand transfers maintained a negative long-run relationship\nwith industrial growth in Nigeria while government expen-\nditure on social services maintained a positive long-run\nrelationship. They concluded therefore that there is no\ncrowding-out effect.\nIt is then necessary to investigate the determinants of the\nsize of public expenditure in Nigeria. This article is poised to\ninvestigate the determinants of the rising tide in public\nexpenditure in Nigeria. The section \"Literature Review\" is a\nreview of relevant literature, the section \"Data and Method\nof Analysis\" dwells on data and discussion of findings, while\nthe section \"Conclusion\" concludes the article.\nLiterature Review\nThe earliest theory of public expenditure could be traced\nto Adolph Wagner (one of the leading German economists\nof his time) who in 1883 propounded an interesting\ndevelopment thesis, which loosely held that as a nation\ndevelops its public sector and consequently public spend-\ning will grow in importance.\nThe theory of public expenditure is the theory of the costs\nof providing goods and services through the public sector\nbudget and/or the theory regulations and laws introduced that\nwill result in private sector expenditure. There are two\napproaches to the question of growth of public sector, namely,\nthe growth in absolute size of public expenditure and the\ngrowth in public sector in relation to economic magnitudes.\nAccording to Brown and Jackson (1994), public expenditures\nare represented in two broad categories, namely, exhaustive\npublic expenditures and transfer public expenditures.\nExhaustive public expenditures are government's purchases\nof labor, consumables, and capital goods and services. For\nthem, exhaustive public expenditures are purchases of inputs\nby the public sector and are calculated by multiplying the vol-\nume of inputs by the input prices. Economists have argued\nthat the larger the size of exhaustive public expenditure, the\nhigher the size of the opportunity cost--crowding-out\neffect--of private sector investment.\nFollowing Wagner's Law, as the national income rises,\nthe public expenditure also rises to meet the demands of\nthe people. As the economy grows and income rises, the\ndemand for goods, including public goods will rise, which\nas a consequence pushes the public expenditure up. With\nrise in per capita income, public provision of consumer\ngoods also rises.\nRelative rise in prices of goods and services, inflation, is\nanother factor responsible for increase in public expenditure.\nPublic services will become more costly, but it does not fol-\nlow that the share of public expenditure for Gross National\nProduct (GNP) must rise. Population change may also be a\nmajor determinant of the public expenditure share. Changes\nin the rate of population growth generate changes in age dis-\ntribution, and this trend is reflected in expenditures for edu-\ncation as well as care for the aged. Changes in the general\npopulation might affect some services, such as defense,\npolice protection, or fire protection, whereas, in other cases,\nit is a specific section of the population that is of importance\nfor the provision of the service, for example, the school-age\npopulation in the case of education.\nPeden and Bradley (1989) examined the effect of the size\nof government on economic output and productivity using\ngovernment activity in the economy has a negative effect on\nboth the economic base (GDP) and the economic growth rate\n(GDP growth)\" (p. 239). Peden and Bradley concluded that\nthe size of government, \"beyond the optimal point\" (p. 243),\nresulted in lower GDP, lower rates of GDP growth, and sig-\nnificant deterioration in productivity.\nF\u00f6lster and Henrekson (2001) examined the growth\neffects of government spending and taxation in \"rich\" coun-\ntries. F\u00f6lster and Henrekson limit their study to rich coun-\ntries due to differences in the composition of government\nspending between rich and poor countries. Covering the\nrobust negative relationship between government expendi-\nture and economic growth. Dar and AmirKhalkhali (2002)\nstudied the impact of government size on productivity in\n19 Organisation for Economic Co-oOperation and\nThey found that total factor productivity growth and the pro-\nductivity of capital are weaker in countries where the size of\ngovernment is larger. They also found that those countries\nwith smaller governments enjoyed efficiencies resulting\nfrom fewer policy-induced distortions (e.g., burden of taxa-\ntion), greater market discipline, which fosters more efficient\nuse of resources, and the absence of crowding-out effects\nthat weaken incentives for capital investment.\nPublic debt impacts on the allocation of the public budget\nto the extent that it favors government spending in some sec-\ntors and not others. As suggested by Alesina and Tabellini\n(1990), debt accumulation is very instrumental in the alloca-\ntion of the public budget. This is supported in the literature\nby Mahdavi (2004), who found that external debt has an\nimportant role to play in the allocation of the public budget.\nHe found that external debt impacts the structure of the pub-\nlic budget by increasing some shares of the public budget\nwhile starving other sectors. This relationship, as argued in\nthe literature (Mahdavi, 2004), reflects a greater role for the\ngovernment as the economy becomes more complex and the\ndemand for public goods and social programs rises. On this\nbasis therefore, we may infer certain changes in the composi-\ntion of public spending as the role of the public sector\nchanges in the process of development. At the early stages of\na nation's development, the government gets involved in\nalmost everything in the economy. But as the economy\nbegins to develop and private sector expands, the govern-\nment usually divests from some sectors and concentrates on\nthe provision of pure public goods.\nThe demographics of the population are important in the\ninternal allocation of the public budget. For example, a popu-\nlation structure with a high proportion of 0 to 14 years sug-\ngests that the government will be compelled to channel more\nbudget allocation to education to provide the necessary edu-\ncational resources and health spending to provide for the pri-\nmary health care. However, a high proportion of the\npopulation above 65 years will occasion a shift of the budget\nto the social services to provide for old age pension and\ngrants. Other aspects such as the population size and density\nand urban population are also important in the internal distri-\nbution of the budget. Because government spending, espe-\ncially health care and social security, tends to be related with\nthe demographic structure of any economy, we need to take\ninto account the variations of dependency ratio of the popu-\nSize of government as proxied by the ratio of government\nexpenditure to GDP to measure the burden of government on\nthe economy is also found to influence the direction of public\nexpenditures (Nyamongo & Schoeman, 2007). As observed\nby Mahdavi (2004), the relative size of government serves to\ncapture the effects of more cyclical factors, such as changes\nin the tax base and government non-tax revenues. It is also\nargued that the size of government is also associated with\nfactors that may impact the composition of total spending.\nThese may include the level of corruption, exposure to exter-\nnal risks such as trade shocks, and internal risks such as\npolitical instability and social conflicts.\nAdvocates of aid argue that aid helps developing coun-\ntries to release binding revenue constraints, strengthen\ndomestic institutions, pay better salaries to public employ-\nees, help in poverty-reducing spending, and improve the effi-\nciency and effectiveness of governance (Brautigam & Knack,\n2004). On the contrary, higher aid inflows could promote\nrent-seeking behavior by domestic vested interests that seek\ntax exemptions or to avoid paying taxes, which lead to reve-\nnue decline (Clements, Gupta, Pivovarsky, & Tiongson,\n2004). Also, critics argued that aid could lead to increased\npublic and private consumption rather than investment, and\ncould have contributed less to growth (Papanek, 1973;\nThe relationship between public capital spending and pri-\nvate investment has become an important topic of discussion\nand study in economic literature. Several researches on this\ntopic have produced ambivalent and controversial results:\nSome support the idea that public capital spending crowds in\nprivate investment, while others support the crowding-out\ntheory. Studies have shown that public investment spending\nand private investment are complementary rather than sub-\nstitutable (Lynde & Richmond, 1992). According to them,\nthe categories of public capital spending, which include\nexpenditure on research, roads and transport, water and\npower projects, education and health, increase productivity\nof the private sector and automatically spur the growth and\ndevelopment of an economy. A study carried out by Foye\n(2014) investigating the determinants of public capital\nspending in Nigeria, using Error Correction Model, found\nthat real GDP, government debt, trade openness, private\ninvestment, and foreign direct investment are among the\nmacroeconomic determinants of public capital spending. It is\nnecessary to note that public expenditure on education and\nhealth improves the productivity of labor and hence of the\neconomy. Therefore, rising private investment is a signal to\npolicy makers to increase in public expenditure on public\ndevelopment (capital) expenditure.\nIn similar way, employing data on manufacturing firms\nof a complementary relationship between public and pri-\nvate capital. While Jenkins (1998) concludes that in the\nlong run, aggregate public investment has either an ambiv-\nalent role or plays no role at all in determining private\ninvestment expenditure, Ndovorwi (1997), however, con-\ncludes that public infrastructural investment is positively\nrelated to private investment in the long run. However,\n4 SAGE Open\nNdovorwi (1997) used quarterly data, which he interpo-\nlated, but Jenkins (1998) used annual data and both studies\nwere for Zimbabwe. Muyambiri, Chiwira, Batuo, and\nChiranga (2010) investigated the relationship between\npublic and private investment spending for Zimbabwe,\nusing the Accelerator model and tested Pairwise Granger\ncausality, and found that private investment granger causes\npublic investment.\nIt has been noted in literature that the political environ-\nment rather than the economic alone affects the public\nspending among countries. For example, a study by Nadler\nand Hong (2011) on how political and institutional factors\nhave affected the U.S. fiscal variables, using standard mul-\ntiple regression analysis, found that controlling for a range\nof economic variables, high public sector union member-\nship, strong collective bargaining rights, and a strong dem-\nocratic orientation in the state legislature were associated\nwith increased yields, reflecting higher default risk. They\nfind that, all things being equal, states with weaker unions,\nweaker collective bargaining rights, and fewer left-leaning\nstate legislators pay less in borrowing costs at similar levels\nof debt and similar levels of unexpected budget deficits\nthan do states with stronger unions and more left-leaning\nlegislators.\nIn 2015, Hong and Nadller carried out a study to deter-\nmine whether political and institutional factors are ger-\nmane in determining how the U.S. fiscal variables are\naffected. One of their findings is that a strong democratic\norientation in the state legislature is significantly associ-\nated with an increase in the perceived risk of the state. The\nresults further suggest that, controlling for a range of eco-\nnomic variables, high public sector union membership,\nthe absence of right to work laws, and strong collective\nbargaining rights are significantly associated with an\nincrease in the perceived risk of the state and that the right\nto strike did not have any meaningful association with\nstate bond yields.\nFurthermore, Hong (2015) sought in his study to deter-\nmine the impact of budget rules on the U.S. fiscal policy\noutcome and whether the impact depends on political and\neconomic environments. He found that balanced budget\nrule is an important factor for fiscal policy outcome. He\nalso suggests that the impact of budget rules depends\ngreatly on political environments, especially on the party\nidentity of the executive power, that budget rules are much\nmore binding when the governor is a Republican, but the\nidentity of the party controlling the state legislature did not\nhave a significant impact. He further enunciated that the\nimpact of budget rules also depends on whether the gov-\nernment is divided. Budget rules were less binding in\ndivided branch government, in which one party controls\nthe governorship and another controls the legislature,\nwhile the impact of the rules was largely unaffected under\ndivided legislatures, in which different parties control each\nlegislative chamber.\nOkafor and Eiya (2011) studied the determinants of\ngrowth of government expenditure in Nigeria using ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) and found that population, public\ndebt, total government revenue, and inflation were all sta-\ntistically significant at 5% level, while inflation was not.\nEdame (2014) studied the determinants of public infra-\nstructure spending in Nigeria, using ECM. He found that\nrate of urbanization, government revenue, population den-\nsity, external reserves, and type of government jointly or\nindividually influence public expenditure on infrastructure\nin Nigeria. Aregbeyen and Akpan (2013) studied the long-\nterm determinants of government expenditure in Nigeria,\nusing a disaggregated analysis. In their analysis, they\nfound that foreign aid is significantly and positively affect-\ning recurrent expenditure at the expense of capital expen-\nditure; that revenue is also positively affecting government\nexpenditure; that trade openness is negatively influencing\ngovernment expenditure; that debt service obligation\nreduces all components of government expenditures in the\nlong run; that the higher the size of the urban population,\nthe higher would be government recurrent expenditure on\neconomic services; strong evidence that Federal govern-\nment expenditure is biased toward recurrent expenditure,\nwhich increases significantly during an election period\nthan would otherwise be the case. Similarly, Adebayo et al.\n(2014) investigated the impact of public expenditure on\nindustrial growth of Nigeria via co-integration and causal-\nity and found that government expenditure on administra-\ntion, economic services, and transfers maintained a\nnegative long-run relationship with industrial growth in\nNigeria while government expenditure on social services\nmaintained a positive long-run relationship. They con-\ncluded therefore that there is no crowding-out effect. From\nthese studies reviewed, there is evidence that all the stud-\nies combined economic, social, and political determinants\nof government expenditure in Nigeria.\nData and Method of Analysis\nThe data for this study were collected from the CBN publica-\nsoftware used was STATA Version 10. The size of revenue\nwas derived by taking the ratio of total government revenue\nto GDP, while size of the public sector was derived also by\ntaking the ratio of public expenditure to GDP. To capture the\ndeterminants of the size of public sector, short-run Error\nCorrection Model and long-run static equation were used for\ncomparing the influence of those variables on the size of\ngovernment spending. The choice of the model is based on\nthe necessity to understand the link between the size of pub-\nlic expenditure and its determinants in the short run and how\nthis relationship is transmitted into the long run. However,\nthe long-run static equation served as a test to compare the\nshort-run dynamics with that of the long-run relationships.\nThe estimation technique used is the OLS due to its features\nof best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE).\nTime Series Characteristics\nThe variables used for the determinants of public expendi-\nture size were tested for stationarity. The Augmented\nDickey\u00adFuller test and Phillips\u00adPeron test were used for all\nthe variables used as determinants of public expenditure, one\ncomplementing (confirming) the other. Table 1 shows the\nstationarity of all the variables.\nFrom Table 1, it could be seen that output growth is not\nstationary at the level form but became stationary after the\nfirst difference. The calculated value for the output growth\nat first difference is 5.648 in absolute value, and is greater\nthan the absolute values of the critical values for 1%\ncance, respectively. The Phillips\u00adPerron test also con-\nfirmed that the growth rate of output is not stationary at\nthe level form.\nThe stationarity test for the external debt (by Augmented\nDickey\u00adFuller) shows that it is not stationary at the level\nform, while with Phillips\u00adPerron test it is also non-stationary\nat all level of significance.\nA closer look at Table 1 for the domestic debt clearly\nindicates that the absolute values of the critical values for\nthe 1%, 5%, and 10% levels of significance are all greater\nthan that of the calculated value, which implies that\ndomestic debt is non-stationary at the level form. The\nPhillips\u00adPerron test also confirms the Augmented Dickey\u00ad\nFuller test.\nThe size of the public revenue is stationary at level form for\nall levels of significance. The Phillips\u00adPerron test also con-\nfirms this result at the same levels of significance. The p value\nfor the Augmented Dickey\u00adFuller test and Phillips\u00adPerron\ntest, respectively. Finally, investment is stationary at first dif-\nference forAugmented Dickey\u00adFuller test and Phillips\u00adPerron\ntest at all levels of significance.\nResults of the Determinants of the Size of the\nPublic Sector\nThe results of the determinants of public expenditure are\nstated in Table 2. The results of the Error Correction analy-\nsis for the determinants of the size of the public sector\nshow that some variables are significant in the short run\nwhile others are significant in the long run. All the vari-\nables were non-stationary at level form but became sta-\ntionary at the first difference; therefore, they entered the\nmodel in their first difference (their order of integration).\nDifferent models were estimated for this, but the discus-\nsion is based on the robust estimation. This is because it\nproduced better and more robust results. The size of reve-\nnue (government revenue/GDP ratio) is statistically sig-\nnificant at 5% level of significance and thus shows that a\npercentage change in the size of revenue will produce a\nlarge percentage change in the size of the public sector.\nThis implies that the size of government revenue is posi-\ntively and contemporaneously affecting the size of the\npublic sector. The nature of the relationship between gross\nprivate domestic investment and the public expenditure\nsize is positive in the short run and is statistically signifi-\ncant at 5% level of significance. In similar way, the growth\nrate of output is positively related with the size of the pub-\nlic sector and is statistically significant at 1% level, imply-\ning that increase in national output (income) will\nautomatically raise the size of the public sector in Nigeria.\nDomestic borrowing (debts) helps the size of government\nto expand. This is deciphered from Table 2, which shows that\nas the domestic debts increase, the size of the public sector\nalso rises. The variable (domestic debts) is statistically sig-\nnificant at 1%.\nTable 1.

Stata Software Output.\n6 SAGE Open\nExternal borrowing is also another factor that gives rise to\nincrease in the size of the public sector, because it has a positive\nlink with the latter and is statistically significant at 5% level.\nThe speed of adjustment of the model from the short run to the\nlong run is statistically significant at 1% level and takes about\n112% to adjust from the short run to the long period (equilib-\nrium). This error correction term is statistically significant.\nHowever, the long-run analysis shows that the size of the\nrevenue also affects the public sector. From Table 3, we see\nthat the size of revenue is positively related to the size of the\ngovernment and is statistically significant at 5% level.\nSimilarly, private investment is also positively related with\nthe size of public sector and is significantly different from\nzero at 1% level.\nThe results from Table 3 also show that growth rate of\noutput is a determinant of the size of public sector in Nigeria.\nIt shows that a percentage change in output growth will lead\nto 13.7 percentage rise in government expenditure, and is\nalso statistically significant at 5% level.\nPublic debts do not determine the size of the public sector\nas could be seen in Table 3. It is observed that domestic and\nexternal debts are, respectively, negatively and insignifi-\ncantly affecting the size of public sector. From this, it could\nbe inferred that in the short run, public debts can be growth\nenhancing by positively influencing the government spend-\ning, whereas in the longer periods, public debts undermine\neconomic progress by negatively affecting the public sector.\nConclusion\nBecause government revenue is a key factor in determin-\ning the size of the public sector, the revenue base should be\nexpanded beyond oil sector to include other unexploited\nsolid minerals, agricultural exports, and other avenues that\ncould increase the revenue base. This would boost and/or\nstrengthen the size of revenue and thus public sector\nexpenditure. Private investment and growth rate of output\nare also determinants of the size of the public sector.\nTable 2.

It could also be seen that this study supports\nWagner's Law that growth of national income raises the\nsize of the public sector.\nIt is advisable that the governments at all levels be very\ncautious in the manner they accumulate debts. In the short\nrun, both the external and domestic debts are contempora-\nneously affecting the size of the public expenditure but\nhave both negative and insignificant links with the size of\nthe public spending. This looks somewhat realistic because\nin the short run, the government makes these borrowings\nto offset some imbalances in its expenditure programs and\nfor stabilization policies, but they (debts) become counter-\nproductive as government would be tied to some debt obli-\ngations--interest payments, debt servicing, repayments,\nrescheduling, and so on.\nFinally, this study has been able to unravel the puzzle of\nwhat determines the size of the public sector in Nigeria as the\nsize of revenue, growth of national income (output growth),\nprivate investment, but public debts (external and domestic)\nnegatively affect the government spending signifying that\nthey (debts) can only be used to offset imbalances in the\nexpenditure programs and for short-run stabilization policies\nand that they become counterproductive later.\n"
