Pharmacological and non-pharmacological\nblood pressure (BP) augmentation therapies are pro-\nmising new treatments for acute ischemic stroke\n(AIS), which aim to improve cerebral blood flow to\nthe ischemic penumbra through mechanisms that\ninvolve recruitment of collateral and leptomeningeal\nvessels.1\u00ad4 A simple approach to increasing cerebral\nblood flow might be through tilting the head of patients\nwith AIS into a ``lying-flat'' (0) head position as\nopposed to the standard sitting-up (30) nursing care\nthat is used in many centers and countries, as recom-\nmended in clinical guidelines.5\u00ad8 Several observational\nstudies suggest that lying-flat improves cerebral blood\nflow velocity (CBFV) as measured by transcranial\nDoppler (TCD),9 but these data are not conclusive10\nand there is variability among clinicians over the best\nstrategy regarding head positioning in AIS.11 The aim\nof this study was to determine whether the lying-flat\nhead position within 12 h of symptom onset, as com-\npared to upright head position, improves CBFV on\nTCD to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in patients\nwith anterior cerebral circulation AIS.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis was an open, prospective, multicenter, inter-\nnational, cluster randomized, ``proof of concept''\nphase IIb controlled trial, with masked outcome assess-\nment. Three centers from two countries participated.\nAll received local ethics approval. The full study proto-\ncol has been published in detail previously.12\nEligibility\nInclusion criteria were age !18 years, have a clinical\ndiagnosis of anterior circulation AIS by brain imaging\nthat excluded hemorrhage or other cause of neuro-\nlogical symptoms, could be safely positioned either\nlying-flat (0) or upright (30) position before 12 h\nfrom symptom onset, have some degree of neurological\nimpairment defined by a National Institutes of Health\nStroke Scale (NIHSS) score !1 upon admission to hos-\npital, uncertainty of the balance of benefits and harms\nof different head positioning within the first 24 h of\nadmission, and written informed consent obtained.\nExclusion criteria were having any contraindication to\nthe lying-flat head position (e.g. active vomiting,\npneumonia, uncontrolled heart failure), have a low\npotential for benefit from either change in head pos-\nition, have a high probability of death within the next\n48 h, have a concomitant medical illness that would\ninterfere with the outcome assessments and/or follow-\nup, have decompressive craniectomy, carotid endarter-\nectomy or other early planned surgical procedure, and\nabsence of appropriate sonographic temporal bone\nwindow for TCD.\nRandomization and blinding\nAll eligible patients admitted during a given month\nwere randomly assigned to either lying-flat (interven-\ntion) or upright (control) head position. Thus, clusters\nwere months, not centers, which allowed stroke care\nteams to follow a monthly protocol without the need\nfor frequent changing of position for individual\npatients. Randomization of head position by month\nwas generated using the online program QuickCalcs,13\nbalanced by center, and managed by the principal\ninvestigator (VO) who had no involvement in TCD or\nfollow-up of patients; this permitted appropriate balan-\ncing of the intervention among clusters and centers.\nTCD results were assessed centrally by masked experi-\nenced neurosonologists. Adjudication of serious\nadverse events (SAEs) and endpoints were performed\ncentrally masking the intervention and following\ndetailed criteria. The 90-day assessment of modified\nRankin Scale (mRS) was conducted locally by trained\nstaff masked to the intervention and other clinical\ninformation.\nProcedures\nInterventions were two nursing stroke care protocols:\n(a) lying-flat head position or (b) upright head position.\nIn (a), patients were positioned to 0 as soon as possible\nafter the diagnosis of AIS was made by brain imaging,\nand this position is then maintained for the next 24 h.\nSide-lying was recommended for prevention of aspir-\nation. From 24 to 48 h, patients were allowed to have\ntheir head raised slowly (to a maximum of 15) and to\nensure they did not have any alteration in their neuro-\nlogical condition (i.e. avoidance of a decline in Glasgow\ncoma scale (GCS) scores of >1 point or an increase in\nNIHSS score of >4 points). After 48 h, patients may\nhave had their head elevated further to the standard 30\nor more. In (b), patients were positioned with their\nhead up to 30 or more as soon as possible after the\ndiagnosis of AIS was confirmed on brain imaging and\nmaintained this position for at least the next 48 h. If\nthere was a clear neurological deterioration, defined\nby a decline in GCS scores of 1 point or an increase\nin NIHSS of >4 points, the patient's position could be\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 13(6)\nOlavarri\nchanged. In all patients, checks of their position were\nmade hourly during 48 h after the intervention. All par-\nticipants were managed by a dedicated stroke team in\nan acute stroke unit, high dependency or intensive care\nunit. Brain imaging (computerized tomography and/or\nmagnetic resonance imaging, and TCD) was conducted\naccording to standardized techniques at baseline and at\nlater stages, according to local protocols. The following\ninformation was collected on admission: medical\nhistory, medications at time of admission, BP, heart\nrate (HR), and scores on the GCS and NIHSS, brain\nimaging findings to rule out hemorrhagic, mean CBFV\nand pulsatility indexes (pin) by baseline TCD on both\nMCA with the patient in 30, according to a standard\nprotocol. Additionally, data were collected on arterial\nobstruction/occlusion and presence of collaterals on the\nbaseline TCD, as well as aspects of AIS management,\nincluding use of thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy\nand routine laboratory tests. Patients were assessed\nduring the first 48 h with the primary goal of ensuring\nadherence to the allocated head position. Accordingly,\nhead positions were recorded hourly for the first 48 h. If\nthe patient's position was changed (e.g. for rehabilita-\ntion or visit to the bathroom), the reason(s) and time\nspent off position were recorded. The following infor-\nmation was collected: mean CBFV and pin on both\nGCS, and NIHSS scores at 24 h; and dysphagia\nscreening test according to local protocols. NIHSS\nscores, dependency assessed with the mRS, diagnosis\nof pneumonia or heart failure (if occurred), and the\ndate of discharge from hospital (if this had occurred\non or prior to day 7, or day of discharge/transfer to\nanother hospital, if earlier). On 90 \u00c6 7 days, all surviv-\ning patients were evaluated, either through in-person or\ntelephone interview, where the following information\nwas recorded: dependency assessed with the mRS, use\nof secondary prevention medications, and the occur-\nrence of any SAE.14 For patients who had died prior\nto any of the above scheduled assessments, the time and\ndocumented cause of death were collected. All SAEs\nwere recorded and additional details were requested\nfor any supplementary information related to an SAE\nand its outcome.\nTCD insonation protocol\nThree hand-held TCD examinations were performed by\nexperienced neurosonologists, initially at baseline\n(TCD-0) immediately after the diagnosis was made,\nwith the participant positioned at 30 sitting-up, using\na standard diagnostic protocol (details of the insona-\ntion protocol is outlined in the Supplementary\nAppendix).15,16 Transtemporal TCD was repeated at\nallocation to the randomized head position. For TCD\n1 and 2, measurements of the mean CBFV and pin were\nobtained on the M1 segment of each MCA at a depth\nof 50\u00ad60 mm, at the same time as measurements of BP\nand HR. Ultrasonography results were adjudicated\ncentrally by two other experienced neurosonologists\n(AB and PMV) who were masked to the intervention.\nOutcomes\nThe main outcome was significant change in the mean\nCBFV in the ipsilateral side of the AIS, as assessed by\nTCD to the MCA at 1 and 24 h after head positioning.\nSecondary outcomes were neurological status accord-\ning to a shift in scores on the NIHSS at 7 days (or\ndischarge if earlier), and functioning according to an\nordinal shift in the distribution of scores on the mRS\nat 90 days. Safety outcomes were the proportion of\nSAEs, including of pre-specific episodes of pneumonia\nand congestive cardiac failure in the first 7 days, and\nany intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or death by 90\ndays. Feasibility of the intervention was defined as the\nproportion of patients who were able to maintain the\nposition for !24 h. Adjudication of SAEs was per-\nformed centrally by clinicians who were blind to the\nrandomized intervention.\nStatistical analysis\nA sample size of 23 group clusters for each intervention\n(total 46 clusters; each with an average of 2 patients),\nassuming an intracluster correlation index of 0.037, was\nestimated to provide 90% power with a 5% level of\nsignificance to detect a clinically significant increase in\nCBFV (mean difference 8.3 [11.4] cm/s) between the\nlying-flat and upright groups.9 All analyses were per-\nformed at the patient and cluster levels according to the\nintention-to-treat principle. The primary analysis com-\npared the proportion of patients with a mean CBFV\n``change'' of !8 cm/s in the ipsilateral side at 1 h and\nat 24 h after positioning. We used 8 cm/s as the cut-off\npoint, based on the results of our previous systematic\nreview and meta-analysis quantifying the effect of head\nposition on CBFV measured with TCD in patients with\nAIS. In this review, which included 57 patients from\nfour prospective observational studies, we found that\npatients positioned lying-flat (0) had a mean increase\ncompared to CBFV in those in the upright position\n(30)9. All analyses were adjusted for the following vari-\nables: baseline CBFV, age, NIHSS, use of thrombolysis\n(or mechanical thrombectomy), and site of vessel\nocclusion and presence of collateral flow identified on\nTCD. A per-protocol analysis was also conducted.\nSafety outcomes were analyzed without adjustment.\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 13(6)\nAll analyses were performed using random effect mixed\nmodels. Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary\noutcome included an interaction test to determine\nwhether the effect of treatment differed significantly\nacross categories for each subgroup, expressed as a p\nvalue for heterogeneity. The following pre-specified\nsubgroups were age < or !65 years; NIHSS scores\nmedian; time from symptom onset to positioning of <6\nversus !6 h; baseline systolic BP below and above the\noverall mean; use of intravenous thrombolysis (or\nmechanical thrombectomy); evidence of vessel occlu-\nsion of collateral blood flow on TCD; and the time in\nrandomized head position of < or ! 24 h. The same\nanalyses for change in CBFV and across pre-specified\nsubgroups were performed for the contralateral side of\nthe AIS. A post hoc multivariate analysis adding atrial\nfibrillation and congestive heart failure was performed.\nData are reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI.\nConventional two-sided levels of statistical significance\n(a \u00bc 0.05) were used. All analyses were undertaken\nusing SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).

These\neffects occurred within 1 h of lying-flat but attenuated\nby 24h, in part from a late increase in CBFV in patients\nwho adopted the upright position, as determined by serial\nTCD. Lying-flat was not associated with an increase in\nSAEs, although this position did produce some increase\nin back pain/discomfort in patients. The change in\nCBFV, however, did not translate into improved clinical\noutcomes for those in the lying-flat position at 7 or 90\ndays but the study was not powered for this purpose.\nOur results confirm findings from previous observa-\ntional non-randomized studies of there being an\nincrease in CBFV in the ipsilateral but not contralateral\nside, from lying-flat in patients with AIS involving the\nOne potential mechanism for the effect is gravita-\ntional force acting on passively dilated vessels to\nincrease pressure gradients and residual blood flow in\nthe ischemic brain, which is supported by the lack of\nchange in pin in the ipsilateral side and increase in the\ncontralateral side in patients lying-flat. Other explan-\nations include improved collateral circulation to the\nischemic penumbra region and passive vasodilatation\nof distal vessels from local perfusion pressure gradi-\nents.18\u00ad20 The absence of any increase in CBFV on\nthe contralateral side of cerebral infarction might\nrelate to there being greater impairment of vasomotor\nreactivity in the region of ischemia/infarction.\nThere were low rates of aspiration pneumonia in our\nstudy, which may relate to the careful assessment and\nmanagement of participants, including the use dyspha-\ngia screening protocols and appropriate feeding\nregimes, as well as the exclusion of high-risk patients\nsuch as those requiring intubation. However, similar\nlow rates of pneumonia were recently reported in a\nretrospective study of consecutive unselected patients\nwho were positioned in lying-flat after AIS.21\nA key strength of this study was the use of cluster\nrandomization to reduce potential contamination of the\nintervention between groups and improve fidelity of the\nprotocol among clinical staff caring for patients.\nAnother important strength of this study is the short\ntime from symptom onset to commencement of pos-\nitioning, which is in line with the proposed mechanism\nby which this intervention could have a clinically sig-\nnificant benefit, that of increasing cerebral blood flow\nto penumbral tissue. Other features were the blinded\nevaluation of CBFV and clinical outcomes, and the\nhigh agreement among neurosonologists performing\nThere are some limitations; however, in that most\nparticipants were from a single center and there were\nimbalances in some of the baseline clinical characteris-\ntics related the overall small sample size. These aspects\nmay have introduced bias, although the results were\nconsistent in post hoc adjusted analyses. Moreover,\nbeing a phase IIb clinical trial, these results may not\napply to a broader range of patients, including those\nwith posterior circulation or mild AIS, or with position-\ning introduced after 12 h from symptom onset.\nIn summary, this cluster clinical trial of patients with\nanterior circulation AIS, showed that the lying-flat head\nposition within 12 h of symptom onset caused a signifi-\ncant increase in CBFV in the ipsilateral side of the lesion,\nwithout any serious safety concerns. Whether such head\npositioning translates into any clinical benefit within\n24 h of symptom onset in patients with stroke is being\nassessed in the phase 3 HeadPoST main study.23\n"
