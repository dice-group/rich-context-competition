The aim of\nthe present study was to investigate whether\nNLR values differ between patients with\nCAD, CAE and coronary slow flow, and\npatients with normal coronary anatomy in\nthe absence of acute coronary syndrome.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective observational study\nrecruited consecutive age, sex and athero-\nsclerosis risk-factor matched patients who\nunderwent coronary angiography while\nattending the cardiology clinic of Elazig\n\nEducation and Research Hospital, Elazig\n ,\nTurkey between January 2015 and December\nwere consecutively recruited into one of four\ngroups comprising: !50% lesions in at least\none coronary artery (CAD group); coronary\nslow flow only; isolated CAE; or normal\ncoronary anatomy. Recruitment of age, sex\nand atherosclerosis risk-factor matched\npatients continued during the study until\neach group count reached 40 patients.\nPatients diagnosed with acute coronary\nsyndrome, chronic kidney failure, chronic\nlung disease, malignant arrhythmia, sys-\ntemic connective tissue diseases, heart fail-\nure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular case\nhistory, any chronic or acute inflammatory\ndisease, thyroid function disorder, malig-\nnancy, and/or chronic liver failure were\nexcluded from the study.\nThe study was initiated following\nPresidential of T.C. Firat University Ethics\nCommittee approval, and was conducted\nunder the regulations determined by the\nHelsinki Declaration. All participants pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nLaboratory measurements and coronary\nangiography\nBlood samples (6 ml for full biochemistry\nand 5 ml for complete blood count) were\nobtained from the antecubital vein prior to\ncoronary angiography and following a\n12 h fast. Samples were drawn into vacuum\ntubes containing 15% K3 ethylenediamine-\ntetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and analysed\nwithin 30 min of being drawn. Haematocrit\nand haemoglobin, platelet, neutrophil,\nlymphocyte, monocyte and eosinophil\nlevels were assessed using a Coulter\u00d5\nLH 780 automated haematology analyser\nvia an electrical impedance method\n(Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA),\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. NLR was calculated by manually\ndividing the digital neutrophil and lympho-\nGlucose, urea, creatinine, total cholesterol,\ntriglycerides, high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\nlevels were measured using a chemilumin-\nescence method with a Cobas\u00d5 e601 auto-\nanalyser and associated reagents (Roche\nDiagnostics Ltd., Rotkreuz, Switzerland)\naccording to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\nCoronary angiography was performed\nafter blood samples were obtained, using\nthe Judkins technique14 with a Siemens\nAxiom Artis FC diagnostic device (Siemens\nHealthcare GmbH, Forchheim, Germany).\nFollowing catheterisation, each patient\nwas administered 350 mg/ml Iohexol\n(Amersham Health, Co. Cork, Ireland) as\nthe contrast agent, and coronary angiog-\nraphy recordings were taken at the left\nanterior oblique, and cranial and right\nanterior oblique, and caudal and horizontal\npositions. All angiographic examinations\nwere conducted by two experienced angiog-\nraphy specialists (MNB and OU).\nCoronary slow flow measurement\nThe thrombolysis in myocardial infarction\n(TIMI) frame count method was used to\nidentify patients with coronary slow flow.15\nTo objectively assess coronary blood flow as\na continuous numerical variable, the sine-\nframe count required for Iohexol contrast\nagent to reach the distal end of the left\nanterior descending (LAD) coronary artery\nwas accepted as the TIMI frame count, and\nthe mean of calculations for at least three\npositions was used. During the measurement\nperiod, the frame at which contrast agent\nentered the artery was accepted as the first\nframe, and the frame at which contrast agent\nreached the distal end of the LAD coronary\nartery was accepted as the last frame. The\nTIMI frame count was then calculated from\nthe difference between the first and last\nframes.16 Since the distance between prox-\nimal and distal bifurcation in the LAD\ncoronary artery is longer than other coron-\nary arteries, LAD TIMI frame count is\nsignificantly higher than right coronary\nartery (RCA) and circumflex (Cx) artery\nTIMI frame counts. A 1.7 constant coeffi-\ncient is used to standardize the measure-\nments and published mean reference values\nvalues that were two units above the pub-\nlished reference values were accepted as\nstandard, and coronary slow flow was\ndefined as values above 38 for LAD, above\nCoronary artery ectasia\nQuantitative coronary measurements were\nobtained by same-day analyses of digital\ndata obtained during coronary angiography\nfor each participant, using Scientific\nQuantification Coronary Analysis software\n(Siemens Healthcare Gmbh, Forcheim,\nGermany). To determine the actual width of\nthe coronary artery lumen, a calibration was\nconducted using the catheter diameter. To\nidentify the artery segment as ectatic, at least\ntwo measurements were taken at the prox-\nimal, mid and distal segments of the coron-\nary arteries in patients with normal coronary\nangiography and normal coronary flow, and\nin patients who were considered to have an\nectatic coronary segment. If the diameter of\nthe artery segment was !1.5 times wider\nthan the mean artery diameter of patients\nwith normal coronary angiography and\nnormal coronary flow, it was accepted as\nectatic and the patient was included in the\nisolated CAE group.\nIsolated coronary artery disease\nCoronary lesion length and percent stenosis\nwere assessed using a quantitative coronary\nangiography method with Scientific\nQuantification Coronary Analysis software,\nGmbh), and ! 50% stenosis was accepted\nas the existence of CAD.

Kolmogorov\u00ad\nSmirnov test was used to determine whether\nthe variables were normally distributed.\nBetween-group comparisons were con-\nducted using one-way analysis of variance\nfor continuous variables and 2-test for\ncategorical variables. Multivariate regres-\nsion analyses were performed to determine\nwhich clinical variables would independ-\nently predict CAE, CAD and coronary\nslow flow. CAE, CAD and coronary slow\nflow were entered into the regression model\nas dependent variables. NLR, age, platelet\ncount, haematocrit, and triglyceride,\nglucose, urea, and creatinine levels were\nentered into the model as independent vari-\nables. Results are presented as b coefficients\nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nSensitivity and specificity of NLR and\nits optimal cut-off values were determined\nby receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve analysis.

CRP levels were found to be\nhigher in patients with CAE than the other\ntwo groups and it was claimed that a more\nintense inflammatory process could be active\nin patients with CAE versus patients\nCoronary slow flow is a condition char-\nacterized by the slowing down of coronary\nartery flow rate, and is defined as delay in the\nfilling of epicardial coronary arteries with\ncontrast agent without the existence of\nstenosis.30 The underlying mechanisms and\naetiology remain unknown, however, stu-\ndies have shown that endothelial dysfunc-\ntion, vasomotor dysfunction, microvascular\ndisease and generalized atherosclerosis may\nplay a role in aetiopathogenesis.31\u00ad34 In\npatients with coronary slow flow, studies\nhave identified lengthwise extensive\ncalcification without narrowing the lumen,\ndiffuse intimal thickening, and atheroma\nplaques in the vessel wall.33\u00ad35 Significant\ndifferences have also been observed between\nproximal-distal coronary artery pressure\n(reflecting the increase in microcirculation\nresistance) and fractional flow reserve values\ncompared with healthy controls.36 As a\nresult of these findings, it was concluded\nthat coronary slow flow is an atherosclerotic\nprocess in the capillaries and large vessels\nthat results in an increase in microvascular\nresistance.

The present study attempted to\nmeasure the inflammatory process by calcu-\nlating NLR, and demonstrated that NLR\nwas higher in patients diagnosed with CAD,\nisolated CAE and coronary slow flow using\nangiography versus patients with normal\ncoronary anatomy, and may be an indicator\nof CAD, CAE and coronary slow flow in the\nabsence of acute coronary syndrome.
