Therefore, the authors performed a prospective cohort study using data from the\nSecond National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Second National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey Mortality Study to determine this relation. This analysis focused upon a nationally\nrepresentative sample of 3,054 adults aged 30\u00ad74 years who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test at\nclassified as having either previously diagnosed diabetes (n = 247), undiagnosed diabetes (n = 180), impaired\nperson-years of follow-up. Compared with those having normal glucose tolerance, adults with impaired glucose\ntolerance had the greatest adjusted relative hazard of cancer mortality (relative hazard = 1.87, 95% confidence\nand diabetes (relative hazard = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.49, 2.62). These data suggest that, in the United States, impaired\nglucose tolerance is an independent predictor for cancer mortality.\ndiabetes mellitus; glucose tolerance test; mortality; neoplasms; nutrition surveys\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; ICD-9, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; NHANES II, Second\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; RR, relative risk.\nAbnormal glucose tolerance is a well-established risk\nfactor for increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular\ndisease mortality (1\u00ad3). Less well appreciated is growing\nevidence that abnormal glucose tolerance may predict an\nincreased risk of cancer (4\u00ad6). Possible mechanisms include\nadiposity-related hormonal effects (7\u00ad9), dietary carcino-\ngenesis associated with diets high in fats and energy (10\u00ad12),\nhyperlipidema (13), and dysregulation of cell growth related\nto high levels of insulin (11, 14\u00ad16) and insulin-like growth\nfactors (17\u00ad24). Results from previous epidemiologic\nstudies of the association of abnormal glucose tolerance and\nhave reported relative risks ranging from 1.5 to 8.0 related to\nimpaired glucose tolerance (4\u00ad6, 28). However, the majority\nMethodological limitations that may account for the vari-\nability in prior studies include the nonstandard oral glucose\ntolerance test (28, 32), failure to control for obesity (31),\nsamples not typical of the general US population (1, 4, 6, 25\u00ad\n27, 30, 32), and lack of attention to impaired glucose toler-\nance as a category distinct from undiagnosed or diagnosed\nTherefore, to determine if abnormal glucose tolerance\npredicts cancer mortality in the general US population, we\nanalyzed data from the Second National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES II) Mortality Study\nReprint requests to Dr. Sharon H.

NHANES II was\nfor Health Statistics. A stratified, multistage sample design\nwas used to produce a representative sample of the noninsti-\ntutionalized US civilian population between the ages of 6\nmonths and 74 years (33). The survey included a physical\nexamination, laboratory tests, and questionnaires on health\nand nutrition-related topics. The response rate for adults\nParticipants\nOf the NHANES II participants, half the adults aged 30\u00ad\nundergo an oral glucose tolerance test. Individuals were\nexcluded from analysis if they attended the afternoon exam-\nination session (n = 14), had a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance\nminutes (n = 2), had a missing 2-hour blood glucose value\n(n = 1,402), or reported race as \"other\" (i.e., neither White\nnor African American) (n = 62). Participants who had type 1\ndiabetes (age of diagnosis < 30 years and current insulin use;\nn = 10) were also excluded. Thus, the analysis sample\nincluded 3,174 White or African-American adults with\nknown glucose tolerance status. For the mortality and\nproportional hazards analysis, participants with a history of\ncancer at baseline (n = 162) were excluded, and participants\nwith missing values for blood pressure, high density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol, education, smoking, or physical activity\n(n = 306) were excluded from the multivariate analysis.\nGlucose tolerance classification\nGlucose tolerance was classified according to 1985 World\nHealth Organization criteria (33). These criteria were chosen\nbecause they were in wide use at the time of the baseline\nexamination and follow-up and because they had been\napplied in most studies of glucose tolerance in NHANES II\n(34). After a fasting blood sample was taken, participants\ningested 75 g of glucose (33). Subsequent blood samples\nwere taken at 120 minutes postchallenge, within 15 minutes\nof specified times. Participants were classified as having\npreviously diagnosed diabetes (n = 248) if they answered\n\"yes\" to both of the following questions: \"Do you have sugar\ndiabetes?\" and \"Did a doctor tell you that you had it?\"; they\nwere classified as having undiagnosed diabetes (n = 183) if\ntheir fasting plasma glucose level was greater than or equal\nto 140 mg/dl or if their 2-hour plasma glucose level was\ngreater than or equal to 200 mg/dl. Participants were classi-\nfied as having impaired glucose tolerance if their 2-hour\nand their fasting plasma glucose level was less than 140 mg/\ndl (n = 480). All other participants were classified as having\nBaseline assessments\nInformation on age at interview, sex, race, years of educa-\ntion (less than high school, high school or greater), and\npersonal health characteristics was obtained by interview.\nCigarette smoking status was categorized as current, past, or\nnever. Alcohol intake was categorized as zero drinks per\nweek, 1\u00ad2 drinks per week, or three or more drinks per week.\nParticipants were asked to rate both their own recreational\nand nonrecreational physical activity as \"much,\"\n\"moderate,\" or \"little to no activity.\" Responses for both\ntypes of physical activity questions were summed and\nrecoded to yield the following classification: 1 (high in one\nand moderate in the other), 2 (moderate in both), 3 (moderate\nin one and low in the other), and 4 (low activity in both).\nThere were no participants who reported high physical\nactivity in both categories. Participants were classified as\nhaving a history of cancer if they answered \"yes\" to the\nfollowing question: \"Has a doctor ever told you that you had\ncancer?\"\nHeight, measured using standardized bar, and weight,\nmeasured using a balance bar scale, were used to calculate\nthe body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) for each\nparticipant. Using a mercury sphygmomanometer, a physi-\ncian recorded each participant's resting blood pressure twice\nin the sitting position. The average of the two blood pressure\n(mmHg) readings for each participant was used in this study.\nLaboratory measures, including standard blood assays for\nserum total cholesterol, high density lipids, triglycerides, and\nplasma glucose levels, were obtained after participants\nOutcomes\nby searching the National Death Index and the Social Security\nAdministration Death Master File (36).

All tests of significance were two tailed, and no correc-\ntions for multiple comparisons were made.\nThe weighted number of person-years was summed sepa-\nrately for each glucose tolerance group. The weighted\nnumber of deaths from cancer was also summed for each\ngroup. Mortality was calculated for each group using these\nweighted sums. The Poisson distribution was used to calcu-\nlate 95 percent confidence intervals (39).\nCumulative mortality was determined using a life-table\nmethod (40). For each 5-year age group, the weighted popu-\nlation based on age at death or at end of follow-up was calcu-\nlated along with the weighted number of deaths from all\ncancers and the specific cancers for each glucose tolerance\ngroup. A life table was developed, and the probability of\nmortality based on age was calculated. Cumulative mortality\nwas determined for all cancers and specific cancers and\nplotted as cumulative mortality curves by glucose tolerance\ngroup. Cumulative mortality curves were compared using\nProportional hazard analyses (41) were performed to\ndetermine whether the observed relative hazards could be\nexplained by other potentially confounding variables\nincluding age, sex and race, education, behavioral risk\nfactors (physical activity and smoking), and biologic risk\nfactors (body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and high\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol). Graphs of the log-log plot of\nthe relative hazards by time were used to confirm the\nassumption of proportional hazards. There were no signifi-\ncant first-order interactions between glucose tolerance status\nand any other covariate (all p values > 0.05).\nAnalysis was repeated using the 1998 World Health Orga-\nnization criteria (42). On the basis of these criteria, partici-\npants were classified as having diagnosed diabetes (n = 248),\nundiagnosed diabetes if the fasting glucose level was greater\nthan or equal to 126 mg/dl or if the 2-hour plasma glucose\nimpaired glucose tolerance if the fasting plasma glucose\nlevel was less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour glucose level\nthe fasting glucose level was greater than or equal to 110 mg/\ndl and less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour glucose level was\nless than 140 mg/dl (n = 71). Because of the small number of\nparticipants with impaired fasting glucose and the small\nnumber of deaths in this group, we combined the impaired\nfasting glucose and the impaired glucose tolerance groups\ninto an abnormal glucose tolerance group. All other partici-\npants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance\n(n = 2,184). To attempt to exclude participants who may\nhave had subclinical cancer prior to examination in\nNHANES II, we also repeated the analysis excluding deaths\nduring the first 3 and 5 years of follow-up.\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of the cohort by\nglucose tolerance status at baseline. Expected trends were\nobserved across the groups from normal glucose tolerance to\ndiagnosed diabetes. Specifically, compared with their counter-\nparts who had normal glucose tolerance, those with abnormal\nglucose tolerance were older and more likely to be female, less\neducated, and sedentary. They also were less likely to be\ncurrent smokers or to drink one or more drinks per week\ncompared with those having normal glucose tolerance. Further,\nthey had greater adiposity, lower high density lipoprotein\ncholesterol, higher total cholesterol and triglycerides, and\nhigher blood pressure. The reported history of cancer at base-\nline was highest for participants with diagnosed diabetes, but it\nwas not statistically different compared with other groups.\nAll-cause mortality\nAs we previously reported, there were 737 deaths (23\npercent) during 42,130 person-years of follow-up. The all-\ncause death rate per 1,000 person-years was highest for the\ndiagnosed diabetes group at 40.9, followed by the undiagnosed\ndiabetes group at 33.2, the impaired glucose tolerance group at\ntrend < 0.001) (43). Likewise, cumulative all-cause mortality\nwas strongly associated with the glucose tolerance group,\nrising from 20.3 percent in the normal glucose tolerance group\nat age 70 years to 26.7 percent in the impaired glucose toler-\nance group, 33.9 percent in the undiagnosed diabetes group,\nand 41.2 percent in the diagnosed diabetes group (overall log-\nCancer mortality\nPatterns of cancer mortality differed from all-cause\nable to cancer.

However, the small number\nof events within each of these groups precludes us from\ndrawing any inferences (44).\nDISCUSSION\nThese data suggest that, in the general US population,\nimpaired glucose tolerance is a strong predictor of death due\nto cancer, particularly colon cancer. This association was\nindependent of adiposity, smoking, and a variety of other\npotentially confounding factors. In contrast, for adults with\ndiabetes, whether undiagnosed or diagnosed, there was little\nor no association with subsequent risk of cancer death. The\nstrengths of this study that lend weight to the conclusions\ninclude a nationally representative sample, long follow-up,\nand use of a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.\nNonetheless, several limitations should be kept mind.\nFirst, we cannot exclude the possibility that unsuspected\ncancer at the time of baseline assessment led to abnormal\nglucose tolerance (45\u00ad47). However, there was no appre-\nciable difference in mortality risk when deaths during the\nfirst 5 years of follow-up were excluded. If preclinical cancer\nwere driving the results, one would expect the risk of cancer\nmortality to decrease significantly when these deaths were\nexcluded. Second, there was nonresponse in NHANES II\nand, in addition, people in nursing homes, long-term-care\nhospitals, and prisons were not included. However, previous\ninvestigation of nonresponse in the oral glucose tolerance\ngroup revealed that respondents and nonrespondents did not\ndiffer significantly in demographic or health-related charac-\nteristics (34). Participants who completed and those who did\nnot complete the oral glucose tolerance test did not differ by\nmortality experience: The all-cause death rate per 1,000\nperson-years for oral glucose tolerance test respondents was\nthere was also potential for misclassification of glucose\ntolerance status at baseline. Previous studies have found that,\nalthough day-to-day variation of glucose tolerance may\noccur, these variations are not the result of changes in insulin\nresponse and are similar to the variations found with other\nbiologic measurements such as cholesterol (48\u00ad50). If\nmisclassification occurred, it was likely to be nondifferential\nand would therefore have produced a conservative bias. In\naddition, only 6.7 percent of the impaired glucose tolerance\ngroup who died had diabetes coded on their death certificates\n(43). Fourth, because mortality follow-up was passive,\nmisclassification of vital status was possible. It is unknown\nwhether the validity of cancer recorded on death certificates\ndiffers by diabetes status. However, autopsy studies have\nfound that the recording of deaths from cancer on death\ncertificates is highly accurate (51, 52). Previous studies indi-\ncate that deaths may be underascertained in Blacks (36).\nInsofar as Blacks were overrepresented in the abnormal\nglucose tolerance groups, this may have produced an under-\nestimate of the mortality risk. Finally, the small numbers of\nspecific cancer deaths limited the power for analyses by\ncancer types, so relative hazards estimates for specific types\nof cancer should be interpreted with caution (44).\nResults from previous studies regarding abnormal glucose\ntolerance and cancer risk are mixed. Of 13 prospective\ncohort studies published since 1980 concerning glucose\ntolerance and cancer, four examined only the increased risk\nof incident cancer for people with diagnosed diabetes,\nneglecting individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or\nundiagnosed diabetes. Of those four studies, three found no\nevidence of increased risk for incident cancer (29),\ncolorectal cancer mortality (31), or prostate cancer (30), and\none study (27) found a slightly increased risk of colorectal\ncancer for women with diagnosed diabetes. Three studies\nthat combined participants with diagnosed diabetes and\nundiagnosed diabetes into a single exposure category\nreported that there was a slightly increased risk of cancer\nmortality and, specifically, pancreatic cancer (25, 26, 32).\nOf the six prospective studies examining the association of\nabnormal glucose tolerance and cancer, five provide the\nstrongest evidence to date linking abnormal glucose toler-\nance and an increased risk of cancer (4\u00ad6, 28, 53). Stengard\net al. (53) did not find an association between abnormal\nglucose tolerance and cancer; however, the study had less\nthan 5 years of follow-up. Levine et al. (28) examined\ndifferent plasma glucose categories after a 1-hour oral\nglucose tolerance test and the risk of cancer in the Chicago\nHeart Association Detection Project cohort. The relative risk\nof cancer for participants with a 1-hour plasma glucose level\ngreater than 205 mg/dl was statistically significant for men\ndata from three separate cohort studies from Mauritius, Fiji,\nand Nauru to determine the association of known diabetes,\nimpaired fasting hyperglycemia, and isolated postchallenge\nhyperglycemia with mortality in 9,179 adults. The relative\nrisk of cancer mortality was greatest for individuals with\nisolated postchallenge hyperglycemia (RR = 8.0, 95 percent\nCI: 3.6, 17.9). Individuals with diabetes did not have an\nincreased risk of cancer mortality. Schoen et al. (4)\nconducted a nested case-control study using the Cardiovas-\ncular Health Study cohort with a mean follow-up time for\ncases and controls of 6.5 years. All participants underwent a\n75-g oral glucose tolerance test at baseline, and exposure\ncategories were designated as normal glucose tolerance,\nimpaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes. Cases were\nselected from participants who had incident colon cancer.\nThere was an increased risk of cancer for impaired glucose\ntolerance and diabetes, although it was not statistically\nsignificant. However, analysis of 2-hour glucose categories\nby quartiles, excluding people with diabetes, found an\nincreased risk of cancer for the highest quartile compared\ntive study of prostate cancer mortality, Gapstur et al. (6)\nfound that, compared with participants with a postload\nplasma glucose level of less than 6.6 mmol/liter, those with\nThe exact mechanism underlying the increased risk of\ncancer mortality in general, and colorectal cancer mortality\nin particular, for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance\nis not clear. Previous studies have suggested that compensa-\ntory hyperinsulinemia (4\u00ad6, 54) may promote carcinogen-\nesis, since insulin has been shown to be an important growth\nfactor, especially for colonic epithelial cells. Impaired\nglucose tolerance corresponds to increased insulin levels\n(55). These increased insulin levels also correspond to\nincreased levels of growth factor and insulin-like growth\nfactor binding proteins and decreased levels of insulin-like\ngrowth factors, all of which inhibits cell apoptosis (13, 17,\n56). Impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia also\ncorrespond to increased adiposity, which has also been\nlinked to increased risk of cancer, especially for colon cancer\nand endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer in\nIn light of these hypothesized mechanisms, why should\nimpaired glucose tolerance be more strongly related to\ncancer death than diabetes itself? One possible explanation is\nthat, as individuals progress from impaired glucose tolerance\nto diabetes, insulin levels decrease from the highest values\nfor individuals with impaired glucose tolerance to levels well\nbelow normal for individuals with diabetes who have -cell\nfailure (55). However, since participants with diagnosed\ndiabetes in this study had type 2 diabetes, it less likely that\nthey had progressed to -cell failure and were more likely\ninsulin resistant. Another possible explanation is that of\ncompeting causes of death, whereby individuals with\ndiabetes may be more likely to die from cardiovascular\ndisease than from cancer. A third is that diabetes offers some\ntype of protective effect as observed by De Giorgino et al.\n(58), who observed that diabetes was associated with longer\nsurvival rates for individuals with malignant tumors. This\nobservation, along with recent evidence that the vessels of\nindividuals with diabetes may impede neoplastic cell spread\nand metastasis (59), may also explain the lower cancer\nmortality observed in participants with undiagnosed and\ndiagnosed diabetes. Each of these observations may\ncontribute to the explanation of why a greater risk of cancer\nmortality is observed for individuals with impaired glucose\ntolerance than for individuals with diabetes.\nThere are three main implications of our study. First,\nimpaired glucose tolerance may identify individuals who are\nat high risk of developing colon cancer to target for increased\nparticipation in screening programs and for rational triage of\ninvasive or expensive screening. Second, individuals with\nimpaired glucose tolerance may also serve as a high-risk\ngroup from which to recruit for cancer prevention trials.\nFinally, although these results do not necessarily have impli-\ncations for cancer prognosis, they do for cancer incidence\nand etiology by identifying impaired glucose tolerance and\nrelated physiologic determinants as potential mechanisms\nand risk factors for cancer.\n"
