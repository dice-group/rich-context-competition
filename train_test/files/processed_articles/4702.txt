It accounts for 36.3%\nof the primary glomerulopathies in China. In children,\nthere is almost 17.2% of IgAN found in primary glo-\nmerulopathies with renal biopsy.1 The progress of IgAN\nis repeated and persistent, and the prognosis is often not\ngood. A study shows that approximately 30% of children\nwith IgAN have progressed to end stage renal disease\n(ESRD) through 20 years follow-up.2 The common\nchanges of pathological morphology in renal tissues of\nESRD mainly present as glomerular sclerosis and renal\ninterstitial fibrosis.\nIt has been confirmed that angiotensin II (Ang II)\nplays a key role in the progress of kidney fibrosis in\nin renal fibrosis of children with\nimmunoglobulin A nephropathy\nYuanyuan Xu1*, Yihong Ling2*, Fan Yang1, Jiong Deng1,\nLiping Rong1, Mengjie Jiang1 and Xiaoyun Jiang1\n Keywords\nAngiotensin II, mTOR, p70S6K1, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, renal fibrosis, children\nDepartment of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen\nUniversity, P.R.

It can control\ncell growth and proliferation by participating in the pro-\ncess of transcription, ribosome synthesis, translation,\nautophagy, and the structure of actin skeleton.6,7 It has\nshown in recent studies that the mTOR/p70S6K1 signal-\ning pathway is widely involved in the renal fibrosis\nprocess in polycystic kidney disease, membranous\nnephropathy, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) renal\nfibrosis, acute kidney injury, and diabetic nephropathy,8\u00ad15\nbut whether this signaling pathway has an important\npart in the renal fibrosis of IgAN is still unclear.\nThis study investigates the expression levels of Ang,\nmTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, and -smooth muscle actin\n(-SMA) in the renal tissues of children with IgAN, ana-\nlyzes the potential correlations of these indexes as well as\nrelationship between these indexes and the clinical pathol-\nogy indexes, and try to explore whether the mTOR/\np70S6K1 signaling pathway is activated in the progress of\nrenal fibrosis of children with IgAN.\nMaterials and methods\nClinical data\nIgAN were diagnosed in the Pediatric Nephrology Center\nof the Department of Pediatrics in the First Affiliated\nHospital of Sun Yat-sen University, China. One child who\ncoexisted with Crohn's disease and five children who had\nreceived angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)\nand angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatments were\nexcluded. Finally, 72 children were included in the study.\nFifty-six were boys and 16 were girls, male: female ratio\nyears. The course of illness in the study, defined from the\nfirst time diagnosed with primary IgAN by renal biopsy,\nwas from four days to nine years, and the median course of\nillness was 78 days. Six normal renal specimens were\nincluded in the control group, five of them were the kidney\ntissues adjacent to neoplastic lesions and the one sample\nwas from a health donor who was not successfully matched\nbefore kidney transplant. There were four boys and two\ngirls in the control group, and the median age was 7.8\nyears (from 4.2\u00ad13.8 years). This study was approved by\nthe ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, and was performed in accordance with\nthe ethical standards outlined in the 1964 Declaration of\nHelsinki. All of the children's guardians had signed the\nconsent form before the research.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\n1. Children having renal biopsy for the first time were\nincluded.\n2. Children under 14 years old were included.\n3. The renal samples of children had to correspond to\nthe diagnosis standard of primary IgAN, the immu-\nnoglobulin, mainly IgA, deposited in the glomeru-\nlarmesangial area and/or capillary loops.\n4. Children with secondary IgAN, such as Henoch-\nSch\u00f6nleinpurpura (HSP), systemic lupus erythe-\nmatosus (SLE), and chronic liver diseases were\nexcluded.\n5. Children who had received glucocorticoids, immu-\nnosuppressants, ACEI and ARB treatments were\nexcluded.\nCases groups\nAccording to the standard developed by the Subspecialty\nGroup of Nephrology, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese\ndivided into three groups based on the clinical features, 24\ncases in the isolated hematuria (IH) group, 26 cases in the\nhematuria and proteinuria (HP) group and 22 cases in the\nnephrotic syndrome (NS) group.16,17 IH means the isolated\nmicroscopic hematuria and the isolated gross hematuria.\nHP is characterized by proteinuria and microscopic hema-\nturia or gross hematuria, and 24 h urinary protein (Upro)\nless than 50 mg/kg. NS is defined as proteinuria, hypoal-\nbuminemia with or without hypercholesterolemia and\nedema.\nBased on the World Health Organization (WHO) patho-\nIgAN were divided into three groups, 33 cases in the\npathology II group, 25 cases in the pathology III group and\n14 cases in the pathology IV group.\nResearch methods\nThe clinical baseline data of all included children in the\nstudy were collected, such as age, gender, course of illness,\nheight, weight, and mean arterial pressure (MAP).\nFasting peripheral venous bloods (2 ml) were collected\nwith separation gel tubes, after 30 min at room tempera-\nture environment, isolated serums were centrifuged under\nand serum creatinine (Scr) levels were detected by a 7170A\nautomatic biochemical analyzer. Serum IgA level was\ntested by immunoturbidimetry.\nUrine specimens (24 h) were collected from all IgAN\nchildren on the day before renal biopsy and the exact urine\nvolumes were recorded with graduated cylinders. Fifteen\nml of mixed urine samples were used for testing 24 h uri-\nnary protein by the sulfosalicylic acid method.\nXu et al. 3\nThe renal tissues of children with IgAN were scored\naccording to the Katafuchi semi-quantitative criteria.19\nThe IgA deposition intensity in glomeruli and tubulointer-\nstitium was measured by direct immunofluorescence\nassay. The expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1,\nE-cadherin, and -SMA in renal tissues were measured by\nimmunohistochemistry method (two-step PowerVision).\nKidney tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and\nembedded in paraffin. Consecutive sections of 4 m were\ndeparaffinized in xylene, antigen retrieval was performed\nwith 1 mM EDTA, then incubated with the following anti-\nbodies. Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-human\nAngantibody (Phoenix, USA), rabbit anti-human mTOR\nantibody (Cell Signal Technology, USA), rabbit anti-\nhuman p70S6K1 antibody (Millipor, USA), rabbit anti-\nhuman E-cadherin antibody and rabbit anti-human-SMA\nantibody (ABcam, UK). Secondary antibodies were\nmouse/rabbit two-step detection kit PV-7000 (Beijing\nZhong Shan Jinqiao Biological Technology Co. Ltd,\nChina). Sections were analyzed with the ZEISS Axio\nImager Z1 microscope and the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 soft-\nware (Media Cybernetics). The percentages of Ang II,\nmTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, and -SMA in the glomer-\nuli and tubulointerstitium were calculated by dividing the\npositive staining area by the total area of the glomeruli and\ntubulointerstitium respectively.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version\n20.0). Data are shown as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD),\nwith statistical analyses performed using one-way analysis\nof variance. Pearson correlation analysis was used for cor-\nrelation analysis between two groups.

But com-\npared to the control group, the expression levels of these\nindexes were markedly higher and the expression levels of\nE-cadherin were obvious lower in the children with IgAN,\nwhich may be related to the kidney injury and suggest that\nthe mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway is activated in the\nchildren with IgAN.\nThe mTOR signaling plays diverse roles in different types\nof renal cells. The mTOR inhibitor can reduce cyst growth in\npolycystic kidney disease by significantly decreasing the\nproliferation and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial\ncells.21,22 In endotoxemia-induced chronic kidney injury and\nsubsequent fibrosis in the male C57BL/6 mice model, the\nmTOR signaling of kidney macrophages was activated, and\nrapamycin can markedly ameliorate kidney pathological\nchanges.23 It was reported that a low dose of the mTOR\ninhibitor rapamycin can inhibit mesangial cell proliferation\nand slow the progression of renal fibrosis of IgAN by modu-\nlating the cell cycle regulatory proteins and blocking the\nG1-to-S transition.24 Tamouza et al. found that the MAPK/\nERK pathway was activated in mesangial areas of IgAN\npatients with proteinuria (>1 g/day) and elevated blood pres-\nsure, which could alter the cross-talk between mesangial\ncells and podocytes and thus generate renal dysfunction in\nIgAN. What is more, as IgA1-dependent MAPK/ERK acti-\nvation requires RAS activity, using RAS blocker therapy can\nmore effectively mitigate proteinuria in IgAN patients with a\nhigh mesangial score for MAPK/ERK activation.25\nTable 9.

It is suggested that the expression levels\nof Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, -SMA, and E-cadherin were\nclosely related to the clinical classifications and renal path-\nological grades, the more serious of the clinical features\nand pathological changes, the more distinct of the activa-\ntion of the mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway and renal\nfibrosis.\nThe activation of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling\npathway may be related to the renal fibrosis in\nIgAN induced by Ang II\nMany studies have shown that Ang II can induce renal\nfibrosis through different transcellular pathways.26\u00ad29\nWhaley-Connell et al.30 found that Ang II could be\ninvolved in the process of renal fibrosis through the\nmTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway in the rat models of\nhypertensive nephropathy.30 The possible mechanism is\nthat the environment of inflammation induced by Ang II\ncan make mTOR out of control in the kidney, and the acti-\nvation of mTOR signaling pathway and the decrease of\ncadherin can jointly promote the process of epithelial-mes-\nenchymal transition (EMT) in renal proximal tubules. The\noverproduction and excessive accumulation of the extra-\ncellular matrix (ECM) induced by EMT can expedite the\nprogress of renal fibrosis. And the significant symbols of\nEMT are the low expression level of E-cadherin and the\nhigh expression level of -SMA.31\nIn our study the correlations between the expression lev-\nels of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, and -SMA in\nrenal tissues of IgAN further suggested that the renal fibro-\nsis induced by Ang II may relate to the mTOR signaling\npathway. The possible reason is that the expression level of\nAng II increases in the kidney tissue of IgAN, which can\nactivate the mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway, and pro-\nmote the process of glomerular sclerosis and renal intersti-\ntial fibrosis. Thus, it may become a significant target to\nblock the renal fibrosis in IgAN induced by Ang II through\nthe control of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway.\nThe results show that, using the Katafuchi scoring, the\nglomerular lesion scores were positively correlated with\nthe expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, and p70S6K1, and\nnegatively correlated with the expression levels of\nE-cadherin in glomeruli. The renal tubulointerstitial lesion\nscores were positively correlated with the expression lev-\nels of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, and -SMA, and nega-\ntively correlated with the expression levels of E-cadherin\nin tubulointerstitium. They further suggest that Ang II and\nthe mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway might play an\nimportant role in glomerular sclerosis, renal tubular injury\nand renal interstitial fibrosis.\nIt was shown in this study that there was no significant\ncorrelation between the expression levels of Ang II,\nmTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, -SMA, and the intensity\nof IgA deposition in IgAN. The findings indirectly support\nthe view that once the abnormal glycosylated IgA1 depos-\nited in kidney and initiated the subsequent pathophysio-\nlogical process, the result seemed have little relationship to\nthe original cause, and also suggest that the injury process\nin the later stage of inflammation played a critical role in\nIt is thought that proteinuria is one of the independent\nurinary protein quantitation were positively correlated\nwith expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, and -SMA, and\nnegatively correlated with the expression levels of\nE-cadherin in glomeruli and tubulointerstitium. It is sug-\ngested that the activation of the mTOR/p70S6K1 signal-\ning pathway in IgAN might relate to the level of\nproteinuria, and the specific mechanism is worthy of\nbeing further studied.\nConclusion\nThe expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, and -\nSMA in renal tissues of children with IgAN are signifi-\ncantly higher and the expression levels of E-cadherin are\nsignificantly lower, which is closely related to the clinical\nclassifications, renal pathological grades and lesion scores.\nIt implies that the activation of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling\npathway may play an important role in the progress of glo-\nmerular sclerosis, renal tubular injury, and renal interstitial\nfibrosis in children with IgAN, and future studies will need\nto address the mechanism of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling in\nthe progress of renal fibrosis in IgAN.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis study was supported by the National Natural Science\nthe Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China\nReferences\n1.
