Policies\nthatareableto influencenetworkeffectscouldproduce\n\"social multipliers\" in the benefits, where the total\neffect of the policy is magnified via social networks.\nRecent work has examined potential social network\neffects in outcomes such as obesity, smoking, and\nalcohol use. Christakis and Fowler have presented\nevidence of the person to person spread of obesity and\nquitting smoking among friends.1 2 Raspe et al pro-\nposed that back pain might be a \"communicable\ndisease.\"3\nMany methods used to estimate social network\neffects are subject to potentially large biases that result\nin the increased likelihood of detecting social network\neffects where none exists. For example, the use of\nstandard econometric methods from literature on peer\neffects substantially reduces evidence of social network\neffects in obesity.4 Previous work that claimed to find\nsocial contagion in the diffusion of prescription drugs\nwas confounded by marketing effects.5\nUsing standard methods we examined whether one\ncan \"find\" network effects using common methods\neven in health outcomes that are unlikely to be\ntransmitted socially: acne, headaches, and height.\nMETHODS\nEmpirical issues in estimating social network effects\nThe general form of the regression equation is typically\nsome version of\nhealthigt\n=healthjgt\n+Xit\n+gt\n+igt\nwhere a health outcome of individual i in reference\ngroup g at time t is determined by the health of other\nindividuals in the reference group, own characteristics\nX, group level factors , and an error term. We focused\non two main empirical difficulties in estimating social\nnetwork effects () within reference groups: firstly, that\nfriendship selection is non-random, which leads to\ncorrelation between the error term and friend's health,\nand, secondly, that confounding factors affect all\nmembers of the reference group (). There are many\nother potential econometric issues, including the\nreflection problem6--it is difficult to separate indivi-\ndual A's effect on individual B from individual B's\neffect on individual A--and the properdefinition of the\nrelevant reference group.\nThe first difficulty we focus on, called selection in the\neconomicsliteratureandhomophilyelsewhere,creates\ncorrelations in health outcomes because individuals in\ngood (or bad) health tend to associate with other\nindividuals in good (or bad) health. This non-random\npattern of association across individuals can lead to\ncorrelations in health outcomes between friends that\nare not caused by direct social network effects.\n1Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,\n600 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA\n2Yale University, School of Public\nHealth, 60 College Street,\nCorrespondence to: J Fletcher\njason.fletcher@yale.edu\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 5\nThe second difficulty, environmental confounding,\ncan occur when a feature of the shared environment\naffects all individuals in the same reference group. For\nexample, a fast food restaurant, convenience store, or\ngym opening near a school could simultaneously affect\nthe weight of all individuals in networks within the\nschool. Importantly, the presence of (often unmea-\nsured) shared surroundings can lead to erroneously\nimplicating social network effects in individual out-\ncomes where none exists.\nThere are several common approaches to over-\ncomingthedifficultiesoutlinedabove.7 Theproblemof\nselection has been addressed through the use of fixed\neffects or random assignments of reference groups,\nsuch as the practice of randomly assigning first year\nroommates at some colleges.8 Other authors attempt to\novercome selection effects by including lagged vari-\nables in the empirical model, though in general this\npractice produces biased results.4 Importantly, new\nresearch that combines multiple strategies to address\nthe multiple difficulties is an important next step in\ndetecting social network effects.9\nThe problem of confounding has generally been\naddressed by controlling for a rich set of individual,\nfamily, and environmental characteristics or using\nfixed effects at the group level.10 The problem, of\ncourse, is that social groups are often faced with similar\nenvironmental characteristics. If these are neglected,\none can improperly interpret the results to imply that\ntrue \"network effects\" exist.\nWe argue that the test statistics drawn from what we\ncall the \"standard\" approach are incorrect. In parti-\ncular, because research has not accounted for the\nproblems above, the standard errors from the simple\nmodels will be unreasonably small. Of course, if\nstandard errors are too small, a researcher will be\nmore likely to reject, incorrectly, any given null\nhypothesis.\nIt is simple in empirical work to assume that\nwhatever information is available in the dataset is the\nsame information that describes the social environ-\nment in which people live. In particular, it is common\nto assume that the set of variables are the appropriate\nones to differentiate environmental confounders from\ntrue network effects. The problem is that the datasets\nused were rarely, if ever, constructed with this type of\nanalysis in mind. As such, the individual and group\ncharacteristics are typically more appropriate for\nevaluating individual level health outcomes rather\nthan group level interactions. To differentiate between\nnetwork effects of obesity and confounders, for\nexample, one would want to know the pattern of fast\nfood restaurants or the caloric content of the school\ncafeteria available to the social network. Inclusion of\nthe individual's race, income, etc, might be reasonable\nproxies for some studies but cannot distinguish two\notherwise similar groups that have different environ-\nments. Estimating a regression of any type without this\nsalient information might show a \"network effect\" if\none school is next to a fast food restaurant and another\nis not.\nThough there are different approaches to estimating\nsocialnetworkeffects,wefocusedontheapproachused\nin Christakis and Fowler1 2:\nhealthigt\n=\nhealthjgt\nhealthjgt-1\nhealthjgt-1\nXit\n+igt\nThis addresses selection issues by controlling for\nlagged health outcomes. The claim is that \"the use of\na lagged independent variable for an alter's weight\nstatus controlled for homophily.\" (An alter is a person\nlinked to the focal person--a friend.) Unfortunately,\nunless selection is conditioned only on this variable,\nthis statement might be spurious. For example, if\nfriendships are formed based on characteristics like self\nesteem, and if self esteem affects both current weight\nandfutureweightindifferingways,thenadjustmentfor\ncurrent peer weight status will not capture the self\nselectionof friendsbasedonself esteemthatalso affects\nfuture weight.11 Another example could be that current\nsmokers who are considering quitting might become\nfriends with individuals who they suspect are likely to\nsuccessfully quit smoking in the future.

The\ngeneral point is that individuals become friends for\nmanyreasonsthatarecorrelatedwithhealthandhealth\ntrajectories,andadjustmentfor onemeasureof friend's\nhealth status is unlikely to control sufficiently for the\nnon-random selection of friends. Finally, in the\npresence of social network effects, the use of lagged\nvariables can lead to bias in estimation apart from the\nissues of self selection.12\nThe second issue with these methods--confounding\n--hinges on whether appropriate variables are\nincluded in the regression analysis. As discussed\nabove, all students in schools that are near a fast food\nrestaurant or that have limited access to exercise\nopportunities share an increased risk of obesity. As\nschoolmates are often also friends, these common\nenvironmental exposures might produce the appear-\nance of \"social network effects\" if not controlled for in\nthe empirical models, particularly if the type and\ndirection of the friendship networks are used for\nadjustment. For example, if individual A declared\nhimself a friend of individual B but not vice versa, then\na social network effect should appear for A but not B.\nUnfortunately, while this \"intransitivity\" of the net-\nwork can facilitate identification of network effects,13 it\ndoes not address confounding.\nIn addition to the equation above, we used logistic\nregressions analysis and generalised estimating equa-\ntions to produce our baseline results for our binary\ndependent variables and ordinary least squares for our\ncontinuous dependent variable (we present the logistic\nand ordinary least squares results, but the generalised\nestimating equations method yielded nearly identical\nestimates).\nData source\nWe use the Add Health dataset to examine social\nnetwork effects in three health outcomes for a national\nsample of adolescents. A full description of the sample\ndesign, data, and documentation is available at www.\ncpc.unc.edu/addhealth.\nAs we intended to investigate potential biases in\nprevious methods, we looked at three health outcomes\nthat could not credibly be subject to social network\neffects and were available in all three waves of the data:\nself reports of skin problems, self reports of headaches,\nand height over time. Among the many health\noutcomes available in the dataset, we found only\nthree for which a social effect was truly implausible. In\nwaves 1 and 2 of the survey individuals were asked,\n\"How often in the past 12 months have you had skin\nproblems, such as itching or pimples.\" Answers\nincluded \"never,\" \"just a few times,\" \"about one a\nweek,\"\"almosteveryday,\"and\"everyday.\" Inwave 3,\nthey were asked whether they had taken prescription\nmedication for acne in the past 12 months. To create\ncomparable measures across waves, we created an\nindicator variable for waves 1 and 2 for whether the\nrespondent reported having skin problems \"almost\nevery day\" or \"every day.\" About 5% of the\nrespondentsreportedthisfrequency,whichwassimilar\nto the 5% of wave 3 respondents who reported having\nprescription medication for acne.\nLikewise, in waves 1 and 2 of the survey individuals\nwereasked,\"Howoftenhaveyouhadaheadacheinthe\nlast 12 months.\" In wave 3, respondents were asked\nwhether they had taken prescription medication for\nheadaches in the last 12 months. To create comparable\nmeasures, we created an indicator variable for waves 1\nand 2 for whether the respondent reported a headache\n\"almost every day\" or \"every day.\" Five percent of the\nrespondentsreportedthisfrequency,whichwassimilar\nto the 5% of wave 3 respondents who reported having\nprescription medication for headaches. Our inclusion\nof a wave dummy variable should control for the\ndifference in headache questions across waves.\nFor our height outcome, we use self reported height\nacross all three waves, which was reported in feet and\ninches. Height was measured in waves 2 and 3 of the\nsurvey but self reported in wave 1. We made several\ncorrectionstotheselfreportedheightvariables.Wedid\nnot allow individuals to lose height over time. We also\ncoded heights that increased more than 8 inches (20\ncm) in one year (between wave 1 and 2) as errors. Our\nresults were quantitatively similar whether or not we\ncontrolled for this measurement error in the height\nvariable.\nWe had information on friends for over 5000\nover time along with at least one same sex friend,\ndepending on the health outcome. For individuals for\nwhom health information on more than one friend was\navailable, we selected the friend with the highest\nnomination (1st-5th). Nearly two thirds of the indivi-\nduals in our sample were matched to only one friend's\nhealth because of the sample design. We selected only\nTable 2 | Association between own health status and friend's health status (skin problems and\nheadache) at baseline and extended specifications.

These sample sizes gave us about 4000 person\nyear observations for each analysis. Table 1 shows\nsummary statistics for our three samples.\nThough there are several important differences\nbetween the Add Health and the Framingham Heart\nStudy used in previous research,1 2 the two datasets are\nsufficiently similar to use to evaluate the role of\ntransmission mechanisms.4 In particular, previous\nwork has shown the ability to largely replicate the\nsocialnetworkeffectsforobesitywiththemethodsused\nby Christakis and Fowler1 and the Add Health data.4\nRESULTS\nTable 2 shows baseline estimates for self reported skin\nproblems, with unadjusted data and data adjusted for\nenvironmental confounding through the use of school\nfixed effects (see below). Our baseline unadjusted\nresults suggest that having a friend with skin problems\nincreases the respondent's chances of skin problems\nWhile the unadjusted result is significant only at the\n10%level,ourintentionisnottostatethattheeffectsare\nrelevant but to show that the findings are fragile. The\n5% standard, typically drawn from Fisher's recom-\nmended threshold, was never intended to be a strict\none, but rather reasonable guidance as a threshold for\nrejection of the null.14\nThis empirical model generates such large results\nthat we would reject a null at the 10% level even when\nthe true contagion effect is zero. The magnitude of our\nresult(relativeriskof1.58)issimilartothe57%increase\nin risk of becoming obese when a friend is obese, as\nreported elsewhere,1 and larger than the 36% increase\nin quitting smoking when a friend quits.2\nTable 2 also shows the results for self reported\nheadache problems. Our unadjusted baseline results\nsuggest that having a friend with headache problems\nincreases the respondent's chances of headache\nmarginallysignificant butquite largeinmagnitude. Itis\nlarger than the reported social network effect for\nsmoking2 and nearly as large as the result for obesity.1\nIntheadjustedresultsintable 2,weshowthatadding\nsimple controls for environmental confounding\nreduces the \"social network effect\" by over 50% and\nrenders the results indistinguishable from zero. We\ncontrolledfor schoollevel fixed effects in our empirical\nmodels to control for all environmental conditions\nshared by students in the same school. These results\nsupport theoretical work in econometrics that show\nthatnot controlling for confounders can leadto inflated\nestimates of \"social network effects.\"6 Previous\nresearch controlled only for a limited set of individual\nlevel variables and time effects but no other shared\nenvironmental factors. Inclusion of school level fixed\neffects does not provide precise information on\nnetwork specific confounders, but even a relatively\nbluntmeasureis effectiveatcorrectingspuriousresults.\nOur results suggest that failure to control for con-\nfounders increases the chances of attributing similarity\nin health outcomes between friends to social network\neffects when the similarities are caused by shared\nenvironments.\nFinally, we examined the \"social network effects\" of\nheight between friends.We used ordinary least squares\nregression analysis because of the continuous nature of\nthe outcome and table 3 shows the results . Our\nbaseline findings in column 1 suggest strong contagion\nin height between friends over time. This finding for\nheight is driven by a different specification error that is\nparticularly acute for height but might be more\ngenerally applicable to other health outcomes that do\nnot change often over time. For the case of height, the\ncorrelation between waves is greater than 0.95. This\nhigh multicollinearity probably generates the \"social\nnetwork effects\" in a case (height) where we would\nexpect no true contagious effects. The association\nbetween friend's current height and the respondent's\ncurrent height was 0.18, but much of this correlation\ncan be explained with adjustment for lagged respon-\ndent height, but friend's height is still associated with\nownheightwithaPvalue<0.10andasmallmagnitude.\nFinally, we controlled for school fixed effects, which\nreduced the magnitude of the \"social network effect\" of\nheight. We believe that the observed correlation in\nheightacrossfriendshipdeclarationsisduetoselection.\nDISCUSSION\nThe methods of detecting \"social network effects\" of\nhealth outcomes commonly found in the recent\nmedical literature might produce effects where none\nexists. The presence of network effects in three health\noutcomes--headaches, skin problems, and height--\ndisappeared after we controlled for environmental\nconfounders. These methods might produce fragile\nresults and consequently can produce premature\nclaims of social network effects in health outcomes.\nLack of controlling for confounding factors is not a\nsolution in itself, but any individual study needs to fully\narticulate the necessary assumptions and explain how\ncommon identification issues apply to the study.

Indeed, given how fragile the results are\nin many cases, one may suspect that other tests of\nsensitivity would generate similar changes in signifi-\ncance. Weaknesses of the study include the marginal\nlevels of significance for two of our health outcomes as\nwellasdatalimitationswithourabilitytotestadditional\nimplausible health outcomes within this sample. For\nexample, it would have been ideal to include other\nphysical characteristics such as foot size or head\ncircumference. In two of our cases, we have P values\nlarger than 0.05, a standard level by which many\nresearchers claim significance, and smaller than 0.10.\nThough on their own we would not submit to the\nstrength of these results, we believe that the change\nfrom a P value <0.10 to a much larger value supports\ntwo points. Firstly, even truly implausible effects can\ngenerate results that support the hypothesis, and,\nsecondly,appropriateinclusionofconfoundersreturns\nthe error bounds to a failure to reject the null.\nThere isa needfor cautionwhenattributingcausality\nto correlations in health outcomes between friends\nusing non-experimental data. Confounding is only one\nof many empirical challenges to estimating social\nnetwork effects, but researchers do need to attempt to\nminimise its impact. Thus, while it will probably not be\nharmful for policy makers and clinicians to attempt to\nuse social networks to spread the benefits of health\ninterventions and information, the current evidence is\nnot yet strong enough to suggest clear evidence based\nrecommendations. There are many unanswered ques-\ntions and avenues for future research, including use of\nmore robust empirical methods to assess social net-\nwork effects, crafting and implementing additional\nempirical solutions to the many difficulties with this\nresearch, and further understanding of how social\nnetworks are formed and operate.\nWe thank David Paltiel and the reviewers and editorial board for helpful\ncomments that substantially improved the paper.\nContributors: JMF acquired and analysed the data and is guarantor.
