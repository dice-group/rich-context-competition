The location and\nsize of tear break regions were recorded and the distribution of first break-up areas was\nsummarized. Patients also underwent conventional break-up time assessments (TBUT test and\nSchirmer's test).\nResults: A total of 43 left and 43 right eyes were examined. There was no significant difference\nbetween TBUT and NIKav-BUT. NIKf-BUT was significantly shorter than TBUT. Both NIKf-BUT\nand NIKav-BUT correlated positively with TBUT. In both the left and right eye, the most common\nfirst break-up areas were the peripheral domain of the inferior precorneal surface and the central\ndomain of the superior portion.\nConclusions: The Keratograph 4 appears to provide an effective noninvasive method for\nassessing tear film, enabling effective preoperative evaluation of tear film break-up regularity,\ninforming the location of the incision and reducing the probability of postoperative DES.\n",

It is therefore\nvital to evaluate the condition of the ocular\nsurface before surgery.10 Eye drops, such\nas artificial tears (ARTs), are recom-\nmended before and after surgery to prevent\nthe occurrence of DES and relieve its\nsymptoms,6,11 but not all cataract patients\nneed such intervention and there is no\nindex to assess individual need. Methods\nfor effective preoperative identification of\npatients with pre-existing DES or the\npotential for surgery-induced dry eye are\nrequired, and guidelines for the application\nof ARTs need to be established.\nThe conventional tear break-up time test\nsince been universally applied for dry eye\ndiagnosis, and used as a standard in many\ninternational diagnostic criteria.13\u00ad15 The\nfluorescein used in conventional TBUT\nmay induce reflex tearing and decrease tear\nstability,16\u00ad18 leading to the development of\nnoninvasive methods that avoid the limita-\ninclude high-speed videotopography,20\nthese techniques require the subjective\njudgement of the examiner, and uniform\ncriteria for noninvasive break-up time\n(NIBUT) remain to be established.\nIn addition to break-up time, noninvasive\nmethods that assess tear film distribution,\nthickness and dynamic changes could poten-\ntially be used to assess tear film stability.23\u00ad28\nOur previous research29 described a tech-\nnique to map tear film thickness using the\nPentacam\u00d5 (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany).\nThe Keratograph 4 (Oculus) noninvasively\nmeasures the first and mean break-up times\nwithout the need for fluorescein, presenting\na colour-coded tear map that dynamically\nlocates break-up zones, which could not be\nachieved previously. The aim of the present\nstudy was to identify the first break-up\nzones in patients with cataracts and DES.\nIn addition, NIBUT (as assessed via\nKeratograph 4) was compared with conven-\ntional TBUT measurement.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited patients with bilateral\ncataracts and typical DES symptoms (dry-\nness, foreign-body sensation, aesthenopia,\nburning, stinging and photophobia),\nundergoing cataract surgery at the\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, Eye and\nENT Hospital of Fudan University,\nslit-lamp microscopic examinations and\nophthalmic examinations, including meas-\nurements of visual acuity and intraocular\npressure. Exclusion criteria were: (i) non\nage-related cataracts (e.g. caused by drug\nuse or trauma); (ii) pre-existing ocular dis-\nease (uveitis, glaucoma, ocular trauma,\nkeratitis, etc.); (iii) history of ocular surgery;\n(iv) use of eye drops for DES or other ocular\nconditions; (v) ocular disorders that influ-\nence the eye surface, such as lid lesions,\nlacrimal dust obstruction, allergies, bleph-\naritis and pterygia. Data regarding previous\nsystemic diseases, and symptoms of dry\nmouth and arthralgia, were collected. The\nright eye of odd-numbered patients and the\nleft eye of even-numbered patients were\nchosen for further examination.\nThe study adhered to the tenets of the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and was approved\nby the Ethics Committee of the Eye and\nENT Hospital of Fudan University\nconsent was obtained from each partici-\npant after the nature and possible conse-\nquences of the study were explained to each\npatient.\nDES diagnosis\nDiagnosis of DES was performed according\nto Japanese dry eye diagnostic criteria,30\nrequiring the presence of more than one\nsubjective symptom (dryness, foreign-body\nsensation, burning sensation, photophobia,\nvisual fatigue or blurred vision, red eye,\netc.), and at least one of the following:\n(i) tear film instability (TBUT) 10 s; (ii)\nreduced tear production (Schirmer's test31)\n5 mm/5 min; (iii) fluorescein staining score\n(van Bijsterveld standard31) !1.\nTear film assessment\nTear film assessment with the Keratograph 4\nwas conducted !30 min before conventional\nexaminations, in order to avoid any influ-\nence of fluorescein on tear film stability.\nPatients were seated at the Keratograph 4 in\na darkened room with the eye focused on the\ncentral target, and a placido disc pattern\ncomprising 22 illuminated rings was pro-\njected onto the corneal surface. The patient\nwas asked to blink three or four times and\nthen keep their eyes open for as long as\npossible. The instrument discontinued meas-\nurement at the next blink. Irregularities on\nthe image indicated the instability or break-\nup of the tear film. At the same time, a video\nwas recorded. After completion of each\nmeasurement, the instrument provided a\nrepresentation of tear film break-up over\ntime, including a tear map showing the\nlocation and size of the tear-break regions,\nas well as the first break-up time (NIKf-\nBUT) and average break-up time (NIKav-\nBUT; the mean of all tear film break-ups\noccurring over the entire cornea). A single\neye of each patient was examined three\ntimes at 5-min intervals. NIBUT was deter-\nmined, as described.17\nA representative Keratograph 4 noninva-\nsive tear film measurement is shown in\nFigure 1. The tear film assessment software\n(15 for each band; top right panel,\nFigure 1), then subdivides each band into\neight small rectangles (with longitude num-\nbers 1\u00ad8), each of which serves as a basic\nbreak-up unit. The colour of the unit in a\ncertain location represents the BUT of this\nunit, which changes in colour from red to\nyellow to green as BUT increases. In the\npresent study, the entire 360 precorneal\nsurface was divided into six areas of 60\neach, and each area was divided into two\ndomains by longitude 4. The domain of each\nfirst break-up unit was recorded.\nBreak-up time (TBUT) test and\nSchirmer's test (without anaesthesia) were\nperformed. For the TBUT test, a fluores-\ncein-impregnated strip was placed in the\npatient's lower conjunctival sac after wetting\nwith nonpreserved saline solution. The\npatient was asked to blink three to five\ntimes then keep their eyes open. The time\nbetween the last blink and the appearance of\nthe first dark dot was recorded as TBUT.\nSchirmer's test was carried out by placing a\nbent strip beneath the temporal lid margin\nand closing the eyes. The strip was removed\nafter 5 min and the maximum wet length was\nmeasured. A single eye of each patient was\nexamined three times at 5-min intervals. All\nmeasurements were carried out by the same\ntrained optometrist (H.F.Y. or Y.X.J.) in\none room, with constant temperature and\nhumidity.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n (%).\nDifferences between TBUT and NIK-BUT\nvalues were compared using two-sample\nWilcoxon rank-sum (Mann\u00adWhitney)\nU-test. Between-domain differences in first\nbreak-up location were analysed by\nCochran\u00adMantel\u00adHaenszel test. The correl-\nation between TBUT and NIK-BUT was\ndetermined using nonparametric Spearman\nanalysis. Data were analysed with Stata\u00d5/SE\nsoftware, version 10.0 (StataCorp, College\nStation, TX, USA). P-values <0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 86 patients with age-\nrelated cataracts (46 male/40 female; mean\nexamined.\nTear break-up time as assessed by TBUT\nwas significantly longer than NIKf-BUT\nThere was no significant difference between\nand NIKav-BUT were positively correlated\nFigure 2 indicates the location of the first\nbreak-up areas in all 86 eyes (three readings\neach). When a first break-up unit was\nlocated in a given domain, it would be\nlabelled once as a dot in this corresponding\ndomain. The total number of dots in\nFigure 1.

Spatial distribution of first tear-film break-up in patients with age-related cataracts and dry eye\nsyndrome (n \u00bc 43 left eyes and n \u00bc 43 right eyes). Each eye was examined three times; in some eyes, several\ntear units broke simultaneously. OD: right eyes; OS: left eyes.\nFigure 2 exceeds the total number of meas-\nurements because, in some eyes, several\nunits broke simultaneously. The numbers\nof first break-up units for different domains\nare summarized in Table 1. There was a\nsignificant between-domain difference in\nboth the right and left eyes (P < 0.001 and\nbreak-up tended to occur earlier in the\nperipheral domain of the inferior precorneal\nother region; in most areas, the total first\nbreak-up units were >10%.\nDiscussion\nThere is a lack of consensus regarding\nnoninvasive BUT measurement methodolo-\ngies, with some studies indicating that\nNITBUT results in significantly higher\nscope-based study found no significant dif-\nference.22 Studies using the Keratograph 4\nhave resulted in shorter NIBUT than those\ndetermined using tearscope, however.34 In\nthis study, there was no significant difference\nbetween TBUT and NIKav-BUT, but\nTBUT and NIKf-BUT were significantly\ndifferent, with the mean NIKf-BUT being\n1.33 s shorter than the mean TBUT. This\nmay be because the Keratograph 4 is cap-\nable of recording small and transient break-\nup areas that may not be visible to the eye.\nEye drops (such as ARTs) are often\nused both pre- and postoperatively in\npatients with cataracts, but there are no\ntreatment guidelines available.\nPreoperative NIKf-BUT assessment via\nKeratograph 4 would allow identification\nof those patients at risk of developing\npostoperative dry eye who would benefit\nfrom ART treatment.\nThe precorneal surface is not evenly\ndistributed and displays dynamic changes\nshown to occur most frequently in the\ntemporal and inferior areas37,38 and the\ninferior periphery of the cornea.39 Thinner\ntear films have been reported to break-up\nearlier than thicker regions.40 The tear film is\nknown to thicken superiorly, to be uni-\nformly distributed in the central region and\nto thin inferiorly.29,41 In the present study,\nthe Keratograph 4 was used to record\ndynamic video throughout the interblink\nperiod (Figure 1, left panel), during which\ntime increasing numbers of break-up units\nappeared. This dynamic process was repre-\nsented in a single plot (Figure 1, upper right\npanel), which indicated the locations and\nbreak-up time of each break-up unit.\nTable 1. Location of first tear-film break-up in patients with age-related cataracts and dry eye syndrome\n(n \u00bc 43 left eyes and n \u00bc 43 right eyes, each eye examined three times).\nLongitude\nCorneal segment\nRight eye\nLeft eye\nData presented as n (%).\nIn the present study, the majority of first\nbreak-up areas occurred in the peripheral\ndomain of the inferior precorneal surface\nthe total first break-up units were >10%.\nThis pattern may be explained by the fol-\nlowing: (i) the effect of surface tension,\nwhich overpowers gravity after the blink;42\n(ii) the continuous secretion of tears from\nthe upper lid; (iii) looseness of the eyelid in\nelderly patients, leading to evaporation in\nthe lower domains. These findings differ\nfrom those of others, who determined that\nocular surface height increased at the super-\nior region over time.43,44 This may be due to\nthe fact that the Keratograph 4 determines\ntear film breakage via thickness measure-\nments, rather than height changes. In add-\nition, the findings of our study may be\ndifferent because the participants were cata-\nract patients, in whom visual acuity and\nvisual quality are relatively low because of\ntheir opacified lenses. Consequently, some\npatients may open their eyes more widely,\nthereby putting in additional effort to see\nclearly, and in turn this might change the\ntear-film distribution. We also acknowledge\nthat the sample size in our study was not\nlarge and this may account for differences in\nthe findings of the present study compared\nwith other research. The findings of our\nresearch were simply descriptive observa-\ntions. In our research, the diagnosis of dry\neye was still made by establishing the tear-\nfilm break-up time, not by measuring the\ntear film break-up area. Our team plans to\nconduct additional research and obtain fur-\nther evidence of the predictive and clinical\nvalue of Keratograph 4 examinations.\nIn conclusion, the determination of\nNIKf-BUT and NIKav-BUT via\nKeratograph 4 may be useful for predicting\nsurgically induced dry eye and directing eye-\ndrop intervention. This noninvasive meth-\nodology displays an intuitively colour-coded\ntear break-up map, enabling effective\npreoperative evaluation of tear film break-\nup regularity, informing the location of the\nincision, and reducing the probability of\npostoperative dry eye. Routine preoperative\nKeratograph 4 assessment of patients with\ncataracts may ultimately enhance visual\nquality.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by the Project of the\nexcellent academic leaders of Shanghai (No.\nScience Foundation of Shanghai (No.\nReferences\n1.
