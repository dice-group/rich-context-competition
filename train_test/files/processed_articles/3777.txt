Executive functions\nare mediated by the prefrontal cortex of the brain (e.g.,\nWelsh, 2001) and incorporate processes involved in goal-\ndirected behavior (Welsh, Friedman, & Spieker, 2006).\nRecently, authors have speculated that a relationship exists\nbetween executive function and identity (Phillips, 2008;\nShanahan & Pychyl, 2007), and research identifying the rela-\ntionship between identity and career decision-making is well\nestablished (Blustein, Devenis, & Kidney 1989; Vondracek,\nSchulenberg, Skorikov, Gillespie, & Wahlheim, 1995). This\nliterature begs the question whether there are relationships\namong all three constructs, executive function, identity, and\ncareer decision-making, and, if so, what is the nature of this\nrelationship? Currently, there is no published research\ndirectly examining whether individual differences in execu-\ntive functions are related to variations in identity status or\ncareer decision-making, the latter being a major focus of\nfuture-oriented planning in college students. Of particular\ninterest in this study was the degree to which identity and\nexecutive functions may jointly predict the levels of career\ncertainty or uncertainty among college students.\nIdentity Development and Career\nDecision-Making\nThe extant literature clearly demonstrates empirical evidence\nfor the theoretical connection between identity and career\ndecision-making, with much of this research based on\nMarcia's (1966) extension of Erikson's original theoretical\nwork on identity development. According to Marcia, an indi-\nvidual may be classified into four identity statuses according\nto one's level of exploration and commitment: identity\nachievement (exploration and commitment), identify fore-\nclosure (commitment with no exploration), moratorium\n(exploration with no commitment), and identity diffusion (no\nexploration or commitment). The relationship between iden-\ntity development and career development is well established.\nFor example, Blustein et al. (1989) studied a sample of col-\nlege students to examine the relationship between identity\n1University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, USA\n2Montana State University, Bozeman, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMarilyn Welsh, University of Northern Colorado, Box 94, Greeley, CO\nEmail: marilyn.welsh@unco.edu\nExecutive Function, Identity, and Career\nDecision-Making in College Students\nMarilyn Welsh1 and Sarah Schmitt-Wilson2\n Keywords\nexecutive function, identity, career decision making, emerging adults\n2 SAGE Open\nformation, as measured by the Extended Objective Measure\nof Ego Identity Status (EOM-EIS; Bennion & Adams, 1986),\nand career development. Their results suggested a negative\nrelationship between moratorium status and occupational\ncommitment, whereas identity achievement was positively\nrelated to occupational commitment. In addition, there was a\nrelationship between career exploration and identity for the\nmoratorium and identity achievement statuses, indicating\nthat processes involved in the establishment of general iden-\ntity (exploration and commitment) are similar to activities\ncomprising the career development process.\nSimilarly, Vondracek et al. (1995) found that junior high\nand high school students who had successfully achieved\nidentity scored lower on all but one career indecision sub-\nscales, as measured by the Career Decision Scale (CDS;\nOsipow, 1987; Osipow, Carney, Winer, Yanico, & Koschier,\n1976). Unexpectedly career indecision scores did not differ\nfor students classified as foreclosed, moratorium, and dif-\nfused, despite the lack of commitment characterizing the lat-\nter two statuses. The authors conclude that differences in\ncareer indecision can at best differentiate identity-achieved\nindividuals from those in the other three identity groups.\nAlthough the relationship between identity and career\nexploration continues to be investigated and refined, current\nresearch exploring cognitive contributions to career deci-\nsion-making is sparse by comparison. One might speculate\nthat by their very nature the processes of exploration and\ncommitment would involve cognitive skills such as plan-\nning, decision-making, monitoring, and organization. The\nempirical question is as follows: To what degree do compo-\nnents of executive function contribute to the career decision-\nmaking process?\nCognitive Factors in Career Decision-\nMaking and the Possible Role of\nExecutive Function\nCurrent literature exploring the career decision-making pro-\ncess in adolescents and emerging adults has examined vari-\nous predictors in addition to identity, such as attachment\nhistory or style (e.g., Downing & Nauta, 2010; Germeijs, &\nVerschueren, 2009) and personality traits (e.g., Bullock-\nYowell, Andrews, & Buzzetta, 2011; Mojgan, Kadir, &\nSoheil, 2011). In terms of cognitive contributions to the pro-\ncess of occupational exploration and commitment, reported\nresearch examines constructs such as \"thinking styles\" (Kim,\n2011), dysfunctional career thoughts (e.g., Bullock-Yowell\net al., 2011; Bullock-Yowell, Andrews, McConnell, &\nCampbell, 2012), and career decision-making self-efficacy\n(e.g., Bullock-Yowell et al., 2012; Germeijs & Verschueren,\ntors, career decision-making self-efficacy (Betz & Luzzo,\nexecutive function, a construct that has not been examined\nexplicitly as a predictor of career decision-making.\nCareer decision-making self-efficacy is defined as an\nindividual's beliefs about his or her capability to successfully\ncarry out a variety of tasks related to the career decision-\nmaking process (Taylor & Betz, 1983). The construct has\nbeen demonstrated to be positively related to decision-mak-\ning certainty (Bullock-Yowell et al., 2012; Germeijs &\nVerschueren, 2009) and negatively related to dysfunctional\ncareer thoughts (Bullock-Yowell et al., 2012). More impor-\ntantly, the Career Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSE-SF;\nBetz, Klein, & Taylor, 1996) assesses individual differences\nin self-appraisal, gathering occupational information, goal\nselection, making plans for the future, and problem solving.\nIt is here that the parallels with components of executive\nfunctions of self-monitoring, goals setting, planning, and\nstrategic problem solving become apparent. Despite the\npotential that executive functions could underlie career deci-\nsion-making self-efficacy, to our knowledge there has not\nbeen any published studies that have explicitly linked execu-\ntive functions to career decision-making processes, such as\ncertainty and uncertainty. There is, however, a small emerg-\ning literature exploring the association between executive\nfunction and identity development in adolescents and emerg-\ning adults and, given that career exploration and commit-\nment is a major element of identity development, this\nliterature is of interest, as well.\nExecutive Functions and Identity\nDevelopment\nThe role of executive function in identity formation has been\nthe focus of theoretical speculation in several studies; how-\never, the empirical evidence is indirect, at best. For example,\nPhillips (2008) proposed that brain development should play\na role in the development of identity, and he interprets\nincreases in identity achievement with age by stating,\n\"Identity scholars can no longer ignore the role played by\nbrain maturation on identity. New knowledge about brain\ndevelopment must be integrated into models of identity if the\nmodels are to accurately describe identity processes\"\nincorporate any direct or indirect measures of brain function\nin his study, or a single measure of executive function, for\nthat matter. The fact that brain development and function\nunderlie identity development, as it does every other human\nbehavior, should not be in dispute; however, whether frontal\nbrain systems are most integrally involved in this process\nremains an empirical question that can only be addressed by\nincluding measures of executive function in these studies.\nThe indirect findings linking executive function with\nidentity are exemplified by studies such as that of Norvilitis\nand Reid (2002), which identified associations between\nexecutive function and gender identity. Their finding that\nexecutive functions related to the masculine characteristics\nof leadership and independence might suggest a connection\nbetween executive functions and identity achievement;\nWelsh and Schmitt-Wilson 3\nhowever, the Marcia identity statuses were not measured in\nthis study. Similarly, Shanahan and Pychyl (2007) examined\nthe relationships among identity, procrastination, and agency,\nand found the construct of procrastination correlated nega-\ntively with achievement scores and positively with morato-\nrium scores. The authors proposed relationship between\nidentity and procrastination that included a role for executive\nfunction. Despite the fact that the authors suggest that execu-\ntive function is necessary to complete the processes of explo-\nration and commitment involved in identity development,\nthere were no formal measures of executive function included\nin this study.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this study was to fill in the gaps of the current\nliterature, particularly with regard to the potential contribu-\ntion of executive function to career decision-making cer-\ntainty and uncertainty. First, we examined the associations\nbetween identity and executive function, after controlling for\nverbal intelligence in a sample of traditional-aged, first- and\nsecond-year college students. Although past research has\nhinted at such associations, typically direct measures of\nexecutive function and identity statuses are not included in\nthe same study. We hypothesized that individuals reporting\nlower levels of executive function difficulties will report\nhigher levels of identity achievement, specifically, due to the\ncommitment and exploration required for identity achieve-\nment and the putative contribution of executive functions to\nthe goal-directed behaviors that would be required. We also\nhypothesized that individuals reporting greater executive\nfunction difficulties would indicate higher levels of diffu-\nsion, a stage characterized by a lack of exploration and com-\nmitment. It was unclear whether executive function would be\nassociated with the other identity statuses of moratorium and\nforeclosure.\nSecond, we examined the prediction of career decision-\nmaking certainty and uncertainty by identity and executive\nfunction. Based on prior research suggesting a relationship\nbetween identity and career decision-making (Blustein et al.,\nwould be a relationship between identity achievement and\ncareer certainty (i.e., confidence in future career plans) and a\nnegative relationship between diffusion and career uncer-\ntainty (i.e., indecision about future career plans). As dis-\ncussed previously, there is no literature exploring the\ncontribution of executive function, per se, to the career deci-\nsion-making process. However, the strong evidence for the\ncontribution of career decision-making self-efficacy (e.g.,\nsuggests the involvement of executive function processes.\nThis exploratory study examined for the first time whether\ncomponents of executive function, metacognition and behav-\nior regulation, as well as identity jointly predict career cer-\ntainty and uncertainty.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe sample consisted of 82 college students (42 Males and\n40 Females) in their first two years of school, drawn from the\nintroduction to psychology courses at a midsized university\nlocated in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States.\nThe mean age of the participants was 18.87 years (SD =\n0.868). Although we did not record ethnicity of our partici-\npants, the students were recruited from a general education\ncourse that most likely reflects the ethnic make-up of the uni-\nversity as a whole. The university has 22% of the undergrad-\nuate students who identify as ethnic minorities: 3% African\nAmerican, 2%Asian, 13% Hispanic, and less than 1% Native\nprovides adequate power to detect a large effect size. Such an\neffect size could be anticipated on the basis of a substantial\nempirical literature linking identity with career decision-\nmaking and a strong theoretical base to predict associations\nbetween executive function and identity and career decision-\nmaking. Participants completed the study as one method of\nfulfilling a requirement for the introductory psychology\ncourse.\nMeasures\nExtended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status\u00adRevised\n(EOM-EIS-R).The EOM-EIS-R (Bennion & Adams, 1986;\nDowning & Nauta, 2010) was used to measure the students'\nidentity status. The EOM-EIS-R is a measure comprising 64\nitems (with Likert-type responses ranging from 1 to 6) with\n16 items pertaining to each of the four identity statuses (dif-\nfusion, foreclosure, moratorium, and identity achievement)\nas defined by Marcia (1980). Total scores for identity\nachievement, foreclosure, moratorium, and diffusion were\ncreated by combining the total scores for the interpersonal\nideological subscales (Blustein et al., 1989). Results of over\n20 studies demonstrated internal consistency from .30 to .91\nwith a median of .66. Results appear to be stable over time\nwith an average test-retest reliability of .76 (Adams, 1998).\nAccording to Adams (1998), the instrument demonstrates\nconstruct, discriminant, and convergent validity in studies\ninvolving samples consisting of college students. The predic-\ntive and concurrent validity of the EOM-EIS-R has been\nestablished by examining correlations between the identity\nsubscales and measures of self-acceptance, intimacy, and\nauthoritarianism (Adams, 1998). These correlations were\nsignificant, albeit in the low to moderate range, and consis-\ntent with theoretical expectations. In the current study, the\nCDS.The CDS (Osipow, 1987; Osipow, Carney, Winer, et\ncomprising the certainty and the remaining 16 the indecision\nscales respectively). Respondents completed Likert-type\n4 SAGE Open\nratings ranging from 1 (low similarity with item) to 4 (high\nsimilarity with item). Reliability estimates obtained from\nuniversity students found test-retest correlations ranging\nparticipants in the current sample, measures of internal con-\nsistency produced Cronbach's alpha of .818 for the CDS.\nThe CDS Manual (Osipow, 1987) reports several studies\ndemonstrating the validity of the CDS as a measure of career\ndecision-making. In terms of concurrent validity, the CDS\nscales significantly correlate in the expected direction with\nthe Assessment of Career Decision Making (ACDM; Buck\nAttitude Scale of the Career Maturity Inventory (CMI;\ncriminative validity of the measure is demonstrated by sev-\neral studies in which the CDS significantly distinguished\nbetween college students self-reporting a commitment to a\nfuture career vs. those self-reporting a lack of occupational\nBehavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. The Behavior\nRating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; Guy,\nIsquith, & Gioia, 2004) consists of 80 questions rated by the\nindividual on a scale of never, sometimes, and often (high\nscores = deficits). This measure includes the Metacognitive\nIndex (MCI; working memory, planning/organization, orga-\nnization of materials, and task completion subscores) and\nBehavioral Regulation Index (BRI; inhibition, shifting, emo-\ntional control, and monitor subscores). The overall internal\nconsistency reliability in the current study was .919 for the\nBRIEF. Moreover, reliabilities for the BRIEF range from .93\nfor the BRI to .95 for the MCI with an overall reliability of\n.96 for the instrument (BRIEF; Guy et al., 2004). Convergent\nand divergent validity for the BRIEF is evidenced by the\nhigh correlations between the BRIEF and other self-report\nmeasures of \"behavioral, emotional, academic, and atten-\ntional functioning and were not correlated with measures of\nsomatization on the CBCL/YSR and BASC-SR\" (BRIEF;\nthe MCI and BRI, were supported by factor analysis, account-\ning for 70% in the variance among a nonclinical sample (N =\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u00adFourth Edition (WAIS-IV).The\nVocabulary subtest of the WAIS-IV (Wechsler, 2008) is a\ncommonly used test of crystallized verbal intelligence. The\nVocabulary subtest has a test-retest stability of .89, and a\nsplit-half reliability of .94. In addition, this subtest correlates\nwith the vocabulary subtest of the WAIS-III at .87 and it is\nthe single best indicator, among the other subtests, of the\nFull-Scale IQ (FSIQ) score, correlating with FSIQ at .72\nwords (increasing in difficulty as the test progresses) used to\nmeasure participants level of verbal knowledge. The test was\nindividually administered utilizing procedures outlined in\npurposes. In scoring the test, each word was scored on a scale\nof 0 to 2 points by a member of the research team. An inde-\npendent scorer then verified the scores and inter-rater reli-\nability was 90%. The researcher addressed and rescored all\ndiscrepancies and final scores were calculated.\nProcedure\nThe study involved two sessions, each lasting approximately\n1 hr. Each participant had to complete the first phase of the\nstudy before completing the second. On arrival at the first\nsession, all participants signed in and they were given an\nidentification card to be used for admittance into the second\nsession of the study (a procedure used to ensure participant\nconfidentiality). During the first session, participants were\ntested in groups of 10 to 20 and completed the BRIEF, the\nCDS, and the EOM-EIS-R. The second session consisted of\nthe individual administration of the WAIS-IV, in addition to\nother tasks as part of a larger study.\nAnalysis\nCorrelation coefficients were used to look at the relationship\nbetween executive function, as measured by the BRIEF, and\nidentity, as measured by the EOM-EIS-R. Backward elimi-\nnation regression analysis was utilized to explore the rela-\ntionship between executive function, identity, and career\ndecision-making after controlling for intelligence. The anal-\nysis included entering all of the variables into the model then\nprogressively deleting predictors until only significant pre-\ndictors remained in the final model. These regression analy-\nses were tested for the following assumptions: linearity,\nindependence, normality, and equal variances (Montgomery,\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nMeans and standard deviations for each of the tasks are pre-\nsented in Table 1.

To facilitate interpretation of these correlations, it is\nimportant to note here that high index scores on the BRIEF\n(MCI/metacognitive control and BRI/behavior regulation)\nWelsh and Schmitt-Wilson 5\nindicate executive function difficulties.

For each analysis, the\nvocabulary score was entered into the first step. The purpose\nof using the vocabulary score as a covariate in these analyses\nwas to account for the possibility that a portion of the shared\nvariance between the executive function and identity mea-\nsures, and that of career decision-making was due to verbal\nability. Given that all three constructs were measured by\nmeans of self-report, each survey is likely to tap verbal skills\nto some extent. In the second step of the analysis, the two\nexecutive function variables (MCI and BRI) and four iden-\ntity variables (Identity Achievement, Moratorium, Diffusion,\nand Foreclosure) were entered into the model. Next, a pro-\ncess of backward elimination was conducted, such that only\nsignificant predictors of career certainty and uncertainty\nwere included in the final model.\nIn the prediction of Career Certainty, the regression analy-\nsis including vocabulary as a covariate, identity achieve-\nment, and executive function, specifically the metacognitive\nindex of the BRIEF, explained 28% of the variance, F(3, 70)\nweights indicate that identity achievement,  = .324, p =\ntors of Career Certainty, whereas vocabulary was not (Table\n3).

Whereas previous research has established the link\nbetween identity development and career decision-making,\nthe associations between a relevant domain of cognition,\nexecutive function, and identity and career decision-making\nhave been unexamined to date. In general, there is little atten-\ntion to the cognitive underpinnings of these constructs in the\nrecent literature on vocational development.\nThe findings of this study support a relationship between\nidentity and career decision-making that has been reported in\nthe literature (e.g., Blustein et al., 1989; Vondracek et al.,\n1995), with career certainty predicted by higher scores on\nidentity achievement. In contrast, career uncertainty was neg-\natively related to identity achievement, but positively related\nto moratorium and diffusion, consistent with the characteriza-\ntion of these two identity statuses with regard to a lack of\ncommitment. These results are consistent with the conclu-\nsions of Blustein et al. (1989) who found that occupational\ncommitment was positively related to identity achievement,\nand such associations are not surprising given that a subset of\nthe questions on the EOM-EIS-R are related to the occupa-\ntional decision-making aspects of identity development.\nIn addition, this study expanded on previous research sug-\ngesting a link between executive function and identity by\nexplicitly testing this relationship with specific measures of\neach construct. Our results provide empirical support for the\ntheoretical speculation of Norvilitis and Reid (2002) and\nShanahan and Pychyl (2007) that there is a relationship\nbetween executive function and identity status. Consistent\nwith our predictions, the metacognition component of execu-\ntive function (working memory, planning/organization, orga-\nnization of materials, and task completion) was related to the\nsuccessful attainment of identity achievement, necessitating\ncommitment and exploration. Furthermore, increased levels\nof metacognition were negatively correlated with identity\ndiffusion, characterized by a lack of commitment and explo-\nration. These results suggest a possible role for working\nmemory, planning/organization, organization of materials,\nand task completion in the process of exploring and commit-\nting to a chosen identity in emerging adults.\nMoratorium, characterized by a lack of commitment, was\nassociated with reports of greater difficulties with the\nmetacognitive index and the behavioral regulation index.\nThis demonstrates that individuals who are actively explor-\ning, but have not yet committed to a direction or plan, are\nalso self-reporting problems with aspects of executive func-\ntion such as planning, working memory, and organized\nbehavior, as well as the executive function components of\nemotion regulation, inhibition, and flexibility. One interpre-\ntation is that those students who are aware of their active\nexploration, but also their lack of commitment, may view\ntheir own executive functions as inadequate not only in their\ndaily behaviors but also in the process of developing a strong\nsense of identity. In addition, we found that the difficulties\nwith the behavioral regulation component of executive func-\ntion were related to the identity status characterized by a lack\nof exploration, that is, foreclosure. One interpretation is that\nindividuals with lower levels of inhibition, shifting, emo-\ntional control, and monitor are more likely to commit to an\nidentity before exploring all possible options, perhaps\nbecause they see themselves as not having the types of skills\nrequired to support such exploration. Interestingly, behav-\nioral regulation was only moderately related to identity\nachievement, and was not significantly related to identity\ndiffusion.\nThe major thrust of our study, however, was to examine\nthe joint contributions of identity and executive function to\ncareer decision-making, especially levels of certainty and\nuncertainty. Whereas, the literature clearly establishes a role\nfor identity (e.g., Blustein et al., 1989; Vondracek et al.,\n1995) there is a need to explore the contribution of cognitive\nskills to this decision-making process. The hierarchical mul-\ntiple regression analyses demonstrated that identity achieve-\nment and executive function, specifically the metacognitive\nindex, were significant predictors of career certainty. The\nresults suggest that individuals with greater levels of work-\ning memory, planning/organization, organization of materi-\nals, and task completion along with higher levels of identity\nachievement are more likely to report greater certainty about\ntheir plans for their future career. These findings are consis-\ntent with the \"planning style\" of exploration (Lumberg,\nrelated to vocational growth. In addition, the results dovetail\nnicely with the literature on the importance of career deci-\nsion-making self-efficacy to the process of career develop-\nment. As reported in several studies (e.g., Bullock-Yowell et\nefficacy involves confidence in one's ability to plan, set\ngoals, and engage in organized, strategic behavior, and this\ndegree of confidence is positively related to career decision-\nmaking. It makes sense that one's confidence in such abili-\nties would be related to one's self-perception of strengths in\nthe underlying skills---planning, goal setting, organized\nbehavior---that is, executive functions. Our findings demon-\nstrate that self-reported executive function skills are, indeed,\npositively related levels of career decision-making certainty.\nIn contrast, an individual's scores on verbal intelligence,\nidentity diffusion, identity achievement, and the behavior\nTable 4.

EOM-EIS = Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status;\nBRIEF BRI = Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Behavioral\nRegulation Index.\nWelsh and Schmitt-Wilson 7\nregulation component of executive function best predict\ncareer uncertainty. That is, those college students with greater\ncareer uncertainty indicated problems with emotion regula-\ntion, inhibition, and flexibility, while endorsing the identity\ndiffusion status and demonstrating lower scores on the iden-\ntity achievement status. Such a pattern of results is also con-\nsistent with the current research examining the role of career\ndecision-making self-efficacy in the levels of career indeci-\nsion (i.e., uncertainty) in adolescents and emerging adults.\nThe finding that the behavior regulation aspect of executive\nfunctions more reliably predicted career uncertainty supports\nother authors' speculations that \"affectively charged\" cogni-\ntions (Cassidy, 1990; cited in Germeijs, & Verschueren,\n2009) are evident during career indecision phases. The com-\nponents of the behavior regulation index of the BRIEF may\nbe considered to be \"hot\" executive functions (e.g., Egeland\n& Fallmyr, 2010) or those executive functions infused with\nemotional and motivational forces. In addition, Gati and\nAmir (2010) point out that career decision-making difficul-\nties (i.e., indecision, uncertainty) frequently involve general\nindecisiveness, problems obtaining information, and chal-\nlenges distinguishing reliable from unreliable information.\nOur finding that low vocabulary (perhaps reflective of other\nintellectual deficits) was related to career uncertainty, but not\ncertainty, might suggest how verbal intelligence, along with\nexecutive function impairments, interfere with the explora-\ntion and information gathering that can lead to a diffused\nidentity and higher levels of career uncertainty.\nLimitations\nWhereas this study provides a foundation for the further\ninvestigation of executive function, identity, and the role of\neach in the career decision-making process, we must note\nseveral limitations. This preliminary study included a rela-\ntively small sample of traditional-aged students early in their\ncollege career, and further research would benefit from the\ninvestigation of the relationship between executive function,\nidentity, and career decision-making among individuals in\ndifferent age groups, as well as in varying situations (e.g.,\nnon-college educated young adults). For example, we were\nperplexed by the finding that neither the Moratorium nor\nForeclosure identity statuses were significant predictors of\ncareer certainty or uncertainty in our study. One speculation is\nthat, in a relatively homogeneous typical sample, the\n\"extremes\" of the identity variable (i.e., IdentityAchievement\nthat involves exploration and commitment, and Diffusion that\ninvolves neither exploration nor commitment) emerge as the\nmost sensitive predictions. Similarly, studying a non-college\nsample of emerging adults might provide more variability in\nthe BRIEF measure of executive functions and allow an\nexamination of how more serious impairments in executive\nfunction may affect the career decision-making process.\nFurther limitations include the fact that correlational find-\nings cannot determine cause and effect, and future studies\nshould use longitudinal designs and path analysis to deter-\nmine whether causal and meditational relationships among\nthese constructs can be determined. Moreover, it is important\nto note that, given that the measures used in this study were\nself-report, there is the possibility of shared measurement\nvariance and a halo effect artificially increasing the correla-\ntions observed.\nResearch Directions and Practical Implications\nThis study builds on previous research and explores the role\nof executive function, a mechanism not previously investi-\ngated as factor instrumental in the career development pro-\ncess. Importantly, exploration of the connections between\nexecutive functions and career decision-making self-efficacy\nwill be a potentially fruitful area of future inquiry. It may be\nthe case that career decision-making self-efficacy is the\nmediator between executive function and the career deci-\nsion-making process. Moreover, the current evidence of the\nrole of executive function abilities in the prediction of career\ncertainty is potentially helpful for counselors, parents, and\nteachers. The logical extension of this finding is that activi-\nties that may increase basic levels of executive function and\nthe subsequent likelihood of identity achievement may better\nprepare adolescents and emerging adults for making deci-\nsions about their futures. In addition, career counselors may\nbe able to use the predictors of career uncertainty found in\nthis study--lower vocabulary, executive function deficits,\nand a particular pattern of identity status--to identity stu-\ndents who might be at risk for delayed or difficult career\nexploration and commitment.\nConclusions\nNotwithstanding the limitations stated above, this study rep-\nresents an important contribution to an emerging literature\nthat has been replete with speculations, but few direct inves-\ntigations of the contribution of executive function to identity\nand to career decision-making.According to the current find-\nings, elements of self-reported executive function are related\nto identity statuses and differentially predict the domains of\ncareer decision-making certainty and uncertainty. Continued\nresearch utilizing direct measures of executive/prefrontal\nfunction will illuminate the manner in which neurological\ndevelopment may influence identity development, voca-\ntional development, as well as other important domains of\nfuture planning characteristic of emerging adulthood.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, G.
