This study assesses whether grandchildren's moving into or out of grandparents' households affects grand-\nparents' depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, and whether such effects vary by gender or race. It further examines\nwhether effects of surrogate parenting on grandparents' subjective well-being are direct or mediated through the impact of\nsurrogate parenting on other life changes, namely, health, work hours, income, socializing, and social supports.\nMethods. The analyses rely on panel data from the National Survey of Families and Households, Waves 1 and 2. The sub-\nsample consists of Black and White grandparents with grandchildren younger than age 18 (N = 1,789). Ordinary least squares\n(OLS) regressions and path analyses are used to identify direct and indirect effects of grandchildren's move into and out of\ngrandparents' household on change in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction (residualized gain scores).\nResults. The data indicate that grandchildren's move into the household increases depressive symptoms among grandmoth-\ners. On the other hand, grandchildren's leaving the household leads to reduced well-being among grandfathers. Grandmothers\nreport less participation in church activities and more supports from friends and relatives after the grandchildren move in,\nwhereas grandfathers frequent bars/taverns more when grandchildren move in and reduce time spent with church activities and\npaid work when grandchildren remain in the household.\nDiscussion. The findings suggest that effects of surrogate parenting differ by gender, and that they are partially contingent\non grandparents' vulnerabilities (marital status, education, and presence of childless dependent children in the household)\nbefore grandchildren join the household. Mediating effects of other life changes are relatively small.\nA exclusively by their grandparents (Casper & Bryson, 1998).\nGrandparents who assume such surrogate parenting responsi-\nbilities can be overwhelmed by the stresses and responsibilities\nassociated with this living arrangement. Among the problems\nnoted in previous research are health problems, financial diffi-\nculties, declines in social activities, stresses in relations with\nother family members, and a decline in subjective well-being\n(for reviews, see Burton, Dilworth-Anderson, & Merriwether-\nSome studies show, for example, that surrogate parents may\nsuffer health problems because of either exhaustion and over-\nload or the physical strains caused by child-rearing activities\nfew effects of surrogate parenting on grandparents' health.\nAnother investigation shows few health differences between\ngrandmothers who live alone and those who are single and care\nfor grandchildren. Furthermore, differences between surrogate\nand nonsurrogate grandmothers were more pronounced for per-\nceived health status than for other health measures (Solomon &\nFinancial problems are quite common as well. Surrogate\ngrandparents carry the financial burdens associated with child-\nrearing, which can be particularly costly if the grandchildren\nsuffer from physical or mental health problems. Some grand-\nparents also have to reduce their work hours or (more rarely)\nquit theirjobs to accommodate grandchildren, and many com-\nplain about difficulties in obtaining funds through federal or\nKrach, Marks, Piktialis, & Watson, 1996).\nAnother commonly mentioned problem is decline in social\ncontacts and insufficient social supports (Minkler & Roe, 1993;\nfor social encounters and often find that their friends, unencum-\nbered by parenting responsibilities, have little understanding for\ntheir predicaments. However, some grandparents may also en-\nhance social contacts after becoming surrogate parents (Burnette,\n1999). Although surrogate parents seek out various sources of in-\nformal and formal supports, the supports they are able to secure\nThere also is considerable evidence that surrogate parenting\naffects grandparents' psychological well-being (Ellison, 1990;\nbridge, Wallhagen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1997). In their panel\nstudy, Giarrusso, Feng, Wang, and Silverstein (1996) found no\nsignificant overall effects of surrogate parenting on well-being,\nbut grandparents who became surrogate parents were more\nlikely than other grandparents to experience a decline in psy-\nchological well-being over time. Using data from the National\nSurvey of Families and Households (NSFH), Minkler, Fuller-\nThomson, Miller, and Driver (1997) showed that grandparents\nwho had assumed \"primary responsibility for grandchildren\"\nafter the first wave of the NSFH scored higher on depressive\nsymptoms than other grandparents. In many cases, emotional\nproblems are attributed to life changes associated with surro-\ngate parenting, to concerns about the adult children, or to health\nand behavior problems of the grandchildren (Hayslip, Shore,\nOther problems noted in earlier studies include loss of social\nstatus, less privacy, fatigue, changes in routines and overload,\nand marital problems as well as family problems, such as lack\nof supports or jealousy of other adult children (Aquilino &\nHayslip, 1994). When the adult children remain in the house-\nhold, tensions over child rearing and household rules may fur-\nther contribute to grandparents' stress (Aquilino, 1991; Caldwell,\nNevertheless, grandparents also derive some benefits from\ncoresidence with grandchildren. Most often noted are: getting\nanother chance at parenting, companionship, a new lease on\nlife, strength through coping, enhanced feelings of self-worth,\nand a sense of belonging (Aquilino, 1991; Aquilino & Supple,\nTaken together, these studies suggest that surrogate parenting\ncan take its toll on grandparents' health, income, employment,\nor social contacts as well as on their psychological well-being.\nHowever, several of these findings and their interpretation re-\nquire further substantiation. First, it remains unclear whether\ndecline in surrogate parents' psychological well-being derives\ndirectly from their surrogate parenting responsibilities or re-\nflects the impact of surrogate parenting on other life changes\n(health, finances, and social contacts). This distinction is not\nonly of theoretical but also of practical relevance. If changes in\nsubjective well-being can be primarily attributed to other life\nchanges brought about by surrogate parenting, then interven-\ntions should focus on ameliorating surrogate parents' physical\nhealth, finances, or social contacts and supports. However, if\nsubjective well-being is affected directly (i.e., independent of\nother life changes), then additional intervention efforts will be\nnecessary to boost surrogate parents' mental health. Further-\nmore, because many previous studies relied on retrospective ac-\n1999), it is important to ascertain that observed changes in\ngrandparents' subjective well-being are indeed causally linked\nto surrogate parenting and not attributable to other factors. In\naddition, several previous studies relied on relatively homoge-\nnous samples in regard to grandparents' gender (Burton, 1996;\ngate parenting responsibilities have similar outcomes for grand-\nmothers and grandfathers or for African American and White\ngrandparents.\nOur aim is to expand on Minkler et al.'s (1997) analyses by\nfocusing on grandchildren's movement into and out of grand-\nparents' household, by investigating effects of grandparents'\ncare for grandchildren on selected aspects of grandparents' life\n(health, income, employment, social contacts, and social sup-\nports) as well as on their psychological well-being (depressive\nsymptoms, and life satisfaction), and by comparing effects of\nsurrogate parenting by gender and race.\nTheoretical Model\nThe transition to surrogate parenting constitutes a stressful\nlife event that can be expected to exert a direct negative effect\non grandparents' psychological well-being, reflected in an in-\ncrease in depressive symptoms and a decline in life satisfaction\n(George, 1990). In addition, grandchildren's presence in the\nhousehold has been linked to various other changes in grand-\nparents' life, especially their physical health, work hours and\nincome, and social endeavors, changes that may be stressful in\nthemselves. Consequently, we also predict indirect negative ef-\nfects of surrogate parenting on well-being through its influence\non these four life areas. Even though social supports may often\nbe insufficient, many grandparents are able to secure some sup-\nports in their efforts to raise their grandchildren; such supports\nhave been shown to buffer the impact of negative life events on\npsychological well-being (Antonucci, 1990). We thus expect\ngrandparents who become surrogate parents to increase their\nsocial supports and predict a positive relationship between in-\ncreased social support and subjective well-being.\nIn contrast, grandchildren's moving out of grandparents'\nhousehold is likely to enhance grandparents' well-being.\nAlthough grandparents whose grandchildren leave the house-\nhold may still maintain some responsibility for their grandchil-\ndren, grandchildren's moving out of the household relieves\ngrandparents of their various, often stressful, experiences with\ncoresident grandchildren and, in some cases, also signifies the\nresolution of problems in adult children's lives that led to the\nsurrogate parenting arrangement. These changes should mani-\nfest themselves in a direct positive effect on grandparents' well-\nbeing. To the extent that ending surrogate parenting also leads\nto positive changes in grandparents' other life spheres (income,\nwork hours, etc.), it can further be expected to have indirect\npositive effects on well-being. Although social supports specifi-\ncally targeted to help grandparents cope with surrogate parent-\ning are likely to decline when the grandchildren move out, this\ndecrease is unlikely to reduce well-being. Thus, we expect no\nindirect effect of grandchildren's leaving the household through\nits impact on social supports.\nLong duration of surrogate parenting may further enhance\ngrandparents' stress by forcing them into more permanent care\narrangements for the grandchildren such as reduction in work\nhours or quitting theirjob. If this were the case, then grandchil-\ndren's continued presence in the household would lead to a fur-\nther decline in grandparents' well-being (Solomon & Marx,\n1999). It is, however, also conceivable that grandparents who\nremain surrogate parents eventually adapt to the situation\n(Shore & Hayslip, 1994). In this case, continued presence of\ngrandchildren in the household would either be unrelated to the\nwell-being variables or enhance well-being (as a result of suc-\ncessful coping). Because Solomon and Marx's (1999) large-scale\nstudy indicates that duration of surrogate parenting enhances\ngrandparents' health problems, we predict that grandchildren's\nstaying in the household will lead to a further decline in grand-\nparents' well-being.\nCharacteristics of the grandparents themselves, especially gen-\nder and race, may condition the influence of surrogate parenting\non well-being. There is ample evidence that women take on most\ncare in families, so that one would expect effects of surrogate\nparenting to be stronger for grandmothers than grandfathers.\nIndeed, some research indicates that surrogate grandfathers\nderive enhanced grandparent meaning from their involvement in\ncustodial care (Hayslip et al., 1998). Nevertheless, grandfathers\nmay assume some care responsibilities, and they may also be af-\nfected by their wives' preoccupation with care of the grandchil-\ndren (Jendrek, 1993). Thus, surrogate parenting is expected to\nexert some influence on grandfathers as well, but the effects\nshould be more pronounced for grandmothers. Evidence fur-\nther suggests that surrogate parenting experiences differ by\nrace. Black grandparents may assume surrogate parenting re-\nsponsibilities under more difficult circumstances (e.g., adult\nchildren's drug problems or incarceration) than White grand-\nparents, and they are also more likely than White grandparents\nto enter this care arrangement under more disadvantaged so-\nBoth conditions could render Black grandparents more vulner-\nable than White grandparents to the stresses of surrogate par-\nenting. We thus hypothesize a stronger effect of surrogate par-\nenting for Black grandparents, especially when socioeconomic\nconditions are not controlled.\nIn addition, a variety of other potential risk factors may im-\npinge on grandparents' well-being. To the extent the data per-\nmit, we control for such potential competing risks (changes in\nmarital status, in caregiving for other family members, and in\nspouse's health). Other controls (age, marital status, education,\nand household composition) adjust for differences in grandpar-\nents' vulnerability.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe study relies on secondary analyses of the National\nSurvey of Families and Household (NSFH), a nationally repre-\nsentative survey of 13,008 households at Time 1. Two waves of\nmation on diverse aspects of family life. Data for main respon-\ndents were collected from a randomly selected household mem-\nber age 19 or older. Respondents were interviewed and also\ncompleted a self-administered questionnaire. Interviews lasted\ntypically between 70 min and 2 hr. Spouses filled out a self-\nadministered questionnaire during Wave 1 and were inter-\nviewed during Wave 2.\nThe NSFH is based on a multistage area probability sample\nthat was augmented by oversampling of minorities, one-parent\nfamilies, families with stepchildren, cohabitors, and recently\nmarried persons. The oversample was achieved by doubling the\nnumber of targeted households. First wave interview response\nrates for the successfully screened households were 73.5% for\nthe main sample and 76.8% for the oversample, resulting in a\ntotal sample of 13,008 respondents. (For a detailed description\nof the study, see Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988.) A total of\nsenting an attrition rate of 23.2%. The subsample used for the\npresent analyses was restricted to respondents who were house-\nhold heads and had grandchildren younger than age 18 at Time\n2 (no information on grandchildren other than their presence in\nthe household was collected at Time 1). Because extended liv-\ning arrangements among minorities may be culturally moti-\nties other than African Americans (e.g., Hispanics, Asians, and\nNative Americans) are too small for separate analyses, we re-\nstrict our analyses to Caucasian and African American grand-\nparents. The number of participants for this subsample is 1,789\n(unweighted).\nTo assess whether attrition may have an impact on results,\nwe compared grandparents who remained in the study with\nthose who dropped out on selected life conditions and well-\nbeing variables at Time 1. These analyses reveal that, for the\nsubsample of grandparents used here, attrition is somewhat\nmore pronounced among the disadvantaged, that is, those who\nare older, have poorer health, score lower on life satisfaction,\nand score higher on depressive symptoms. This means that we\nmay underestimate effects of surrogate parenting because the\nmost vulnerable grandparents are somewhat underrepresented.\nHowever, two-step Heckman selectivity tests (Heckman, 1979)\nusing unweighted data indicated no major effect of attrition on\nour models. In addition, attrition effects should be limited be-\ncause the weights used in the analyses adjusted for attrition as\nwell as oversampling and nonresponses.\nMeasures\nDependent variables.--Two measures of well-being were\nused in the analysis: depressive symptoms and life satisfaction.\nDepressive symptoms were assessed with a modified version of\nthe CES-D. The CES-D was designed to assess depressive\nsymptoms in the general population, is widely used in mental\nhealth research, and has also been applied to older populations\nRadloff, 1977). The CES-D version included in the NSFH con-\ntains items pertaining to two (Affect and Somatic) of the usual\nfour CES-D subscales. Specifically, respondents were asked,\n\"Next is a list of ways you might have felt or behaved during\nthe past week. On how many days during the past week did\nyou: feel bothered by things that usually don't bother you, not\nfeel like eating, feel that you could not shake off the blues even\nwith help from family or friends, have trouble keeping your\nmind on what you were doing, feel depressed, feel that every-\nthing you did was an effort, feel fearful, sleep restlessly, talk\nless than usual, feel lonely, feel sad, feel you could not get\ngoing\" (0 to 7 days). Factor analyses indicated that the CES-D\nitems included in the NSFH constitute one single dimension, a\nfinding further substantiated by reliability analyses (Cronbach's\na = .93 for Wave 1 and Wave 2). These values remained the\nsame regardless of whether missing values were imputed or\nnot. Because the items seemed to reflect a single dimension,\ntotal depressive symptom scores were derived by adding item\nscores for each wave.\nTo assess change in depressive symptoms between waves,\nwe derived unstandardized residuals from regressions of Wave\n2 on Wave 1 scores (with no other controls). These residuals\nreflect Wave 2 depressive symptoms net of Wave 1 depressive\nsymptoms and can, therefore, be interpreted as gain scores\nto correlated measurement error, we also performed confirma-\ntory factor analyses to estimate Wave 1 and Wave 2 scores for\ndepressive symptoms, using the AMOS structural equation\nprogram (Arbuckle, 1997). Because results derived from these\ntwo methods of constructing scores for depressive symptoms\nwere quite similar, we relied on the raw scores. The residuals\nfrom raw scale scores are easier to interpret and also allow\nadjustments for sample stratification and clustering that are\ntypically not available in structural equation analyses pro-\ngrams. High scores indicate increases in depressive symptoms\nover time.\nThe second well-being measure is life satisfaction.\nRespondents were asked: \"Taking all things together, how\nwould you say things are these days?\" (1 = very unhappy, 7 =\nvery happy). Unstandardized residuals were used as indicators\nof change in life satisfaction over time. In this case, high scores\nreflect an increase in life satisfaction between waves. Means\nand standard deviations for the dependent and independent vari-\nables are shown in Table 1.\nIndependent variables.--The major independent variables in\nthe model are surrogate parenting and grandparents' life\nchanges (health, employment, income, social supports, and so-\ncial contacts).\nSurrogate parenting was derived from the household rosters\nincluded in both waves. Comparison of grandchildren's pres-\nence in the household at Time 1 and Time 2 resulted in the\nfollowing surrogate parenting variables, coded as dummy vari-\nables: grandchildren move in (no grandchildren in the household\nat Time 1, and grandchildren in the household at Time 2),\ngrandchildren stay (grandchildren in the household at both\nwaves), and grandchildren move out (grandchildren in the\nhousehold at Time 1 but not at Time 2). Grandparents with no\ngrandchildren in the household at both waves served as the ref-\nerence category. The distribution of grandparents by surrogate\nparenting responsibility is shown in Table 2. Because adult chil-\ndren and their children may also move to the (grand)parents'\nhousehold to take care of the grandparent, we attempted to ex-\nclude these cases in the designation of surrogate parenting.\nUnfortunately, the available data are insufficient to distinguish\nbetween coparenting and other care arrangements in all cases.\nThus, a few cases that do not constitute surrogate parenting\nmay have been included.\nOverall, 10.7% of grandparents had grandchildren in their\nhouseholds at either wave. In over one half (52.3%) of these\ncases grandchildren moved in between waves, in over one quar-\ngrandchildren remained in the household over both waves.\nBoth waves of the NSFH included questions about respon-\ndents' work hours. In Wave 1, total work hours were assessed,\nwhereas in Wave 2 respondents were asked separately about\nwork hours in their primary and secondaryjobs. Hours in these\njobs were combined to arrive at Time 2 work hours.\nHealth was measured with the question: \"Compared to other\npeople your age, how would you describe your health?\" (1 =\nvery poor, 5 = excellent).\nIncome was based on constructed measures provided in the\nNSFH. These measures include both individuals' own personal\nincome as well as couple incomes. The income variable used in\nthe analyses combines these two measures. Specifically, re-\nTable 1.

This procedure\nprovides more comparable data on not only respondents' living\nstandard but also on changes in their living standard over time\nin cases of divorce, remarriage, or widowhood. Income for both\nwaves was logged.\nThe social support measures rely on questions about help re-\nceived from friends, parents, children, siblings, and other rela-\ntives in any of the following areas: babysitting, transportation,\nhousework, and advice (yes/no). Because type of support (ad-\nvice vs instrumental) and source (relatives or friends) may alle-\nviate the stresses of surrogate parenting in different ways, we\nused three different support measures: number of sources (chil-\ndren, siblings, other relatives, and friends) providing advice\n(range = 0-4), number of instrumental supports (babysitting,\nhousework and repairs, and transportation) from friends (range\n= 0-3), and number of instrumental supports from any rela-\ntives (range = 0-9).\nThe social contact variables available in the NSFH refer to\nhow often respondents socialized (spent a social evening) with\nrelatives, neighbors, or friends, how often they participated in\nsocial events at their church or synagogue, how often they at-\ntended church services, how often they went to a bar/tavern,\nand how often they joined in group recreational activities. The\nlatter variable (group activities) had no impact on any of the\nwell-being variables and was not used in the final analyses.\nExcept for church attendance, scores for the social contact vari-\nables ranged from 0 (never) to 4 (several times a week). Church\nattendance was measured in number of visits per year (range =\n0-365). Initial analyses (ordinary and confirmatory factor analy-\nsis, and reliability) showed that these items do not scale (e.g.,\nCronbach's a < .50). Thus, single-item measures were used.\nOf primary interest for our analyses is whether the impact of\nsurrogate parenting on well-being is direct or mediated through\nits effect on grandparents' health, employment, income, social\ncontacts, or social supports. Thus, change between waves is the\nmain focus. To measure change, we derived gain scores from\nregressions in which the dependent variable was the selected\ncharacteristic (income, health, etc.) at Time 2, and the sole in-\ndependent variable was this same characteristic at Time 1. The\nunstandardized residuals from these regressions can be inter-\npreted as gain scores. These residuals were used as independent\nor dependent variables in the analyses.\nIn addition, various control variables were included in the\nanalyses. They consist of major demographic and household\ncharacteristics including gender, race, marital status, presence\nof dependent childless children in the household (all coded as\ndummy variables), age, and education. Dependent children are\ndefined as children younger than age 19. Furthermore, other\nlife changes that may influence respondents' well-being were\ncontrolled. Changes in caregiving responsibilities for household\nmembers were assessed on the basis of questions asking re-\nspondents whether they provided care to disabled household\nmembers or to persons outside the household. Those who re-\nported such caregiving responsibilities at Time 2 but not at\nTime 1 were coded as having started caregiving. We also exam-\nined whether stopping caregiving (caregiving at Time 1 but not\nat Time 2) affected well-being. Because there was no signifi-\ncant effect, this variable was not used in the final analyses.\nMarital status changes were represented in two dummy vari-\nables: whether respondents started a new relationship or ended\ntheir marriage between waves. Multiple changes (e.g., a respon-\ndent who got divorced and then remarried) would be reflected\nin a score of 1 (yes) on both measures. In addition, changes in\ntheir spouses' lives (work hours, or health) may influence re-\nspondents' well-being. Preliminary analyses revealed that only\nimprovements in spouses' health contributed significantly to\nchanges in well-being. Because many grandparents are not\nmarried, improvement in spouses' health had to be coded as a\ndummy variable. In this case, the reference category combined\nrespondents whose spouses underwent no change with those\nwho were not married. This coding procedure is appropriate\nwhen marital status is also controlled and essentially distin-\nguishes respondents whose spouses underwent some change\nfrom respondents who experienced no change (either because\nspouse's health remained the same or because they were not\nmarried). Other controls considered in initial analyses (change\nin spouse's work hours, deaths of relatives, number of grand-\nchildren outside the household, and presence of adult childless\nchildren in the household) did not influence relationships be-\ntween the major independent variables and well-being and were\nnot retained in thefinalmodels.\nMany of the variables have missing values. Because a signifi-\ncant reduction in sample size and biases in the data may have\nresulted if all cases with missing values were excluded (King,\nreplaced missing values using the SPSS missing value analysis\nprogram. Estimation of imputed values required several steps.\nThe first step was to examine the missing data patterns (Little\n& Schenker, 1995). Little and Schenker's chi-square test for\nmissing completely at random (MCAR) showed a nonrandom\npattern at both Time 1 and Time 2. Given this nonrandom pat-\ntern, pairwise or listwise exclusion of missing values is inap-\npropriate. The imputed data were estimated with EM (expecta-\ntion maximization) maximum likelihood algorithms. Because\nmissing value imputation can affect estimates of standard er-\nrors, we used bootstrapping to estimate standard errors and con-\nfidence intervals for variables with imputed values (Stata,\n1997). The resulting estimates were essentially the same as\nthose derived from the original analyses. Consequently, signifi-\ncance levels derived from the original estimates of standard er-\nrors are reported. Intercorrelations among the independent vari-\nables were low to moderate, and multicollinearity is not a\nproblem, as indicated by an average variance inflation (VIF) of\nweighted for men, and N = 1,119 unweighted for women, with\nAnalyses\nThe analyses relied on ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-\nsions. Estimation of standard errors was adjusted for complex\nsurveys (Stata, 1997). Because standardized coefficients cannot\nbe derived from analyses that adjust for sample design (Stata,\n1997), the betas shown in the tables are based on OLS regres-\nsions with robust standard errors. Three models are shown in\nthe tables: The first model includes gender, race, and the surro-\ngate parent variables; the second model includes all variables;\nand the third model includes all variables except for selected\ncontrols (age, marital status, education, and presence of depen-\ndent childless children in the household). Other models (e.g.,\nexcluding life changes) were also estimated but are not shown\nin the tables. We assessed variations in the effects of surrogate\nparenting by gender and race through interaction terms (Race\nX Surrogate Parenting, and Gender X Surrogate Parenting).\nBecause differences in the gender distribution by race may con-\nfound race and gender interactions, race interactions were tested\nseparately for all respondents and for female participants. The\nnumber of surrogate grandfathers was too small to test for race\ndifferences. To examine whether the effects of surrogate parent-\ning are mediated by its impact on work hours, health, social\ncontacts, income, or supports, path analysis (Alwin & Hauser,\n1981) was used. Path analysis decomposes the effect of an in-\ndependent variable into its direct effect (i.e., the coefficients de-\nrived from regressing depressive symptoms on the surrogate\nparenting and selected control and mediating variables) and its\nindirect effect (derived from the cross-product of the effect of\nsurrogate parenting on the mediating variables--health, in-\ncome, etc.--and the effects of the mediating variables on de-\npressive symptoms). Indirect effects are deemed significant\nonly if both coefficients (the correlation between the surrogate\nparenting and the mediating variables as well as the correlation\nbetween the mediating and dependent variables) are significant.\nRESULTS\nThe results are presented in three sections. We first address\nthe impact of surrogate parenting on selected life changes. Then\nwe discuss effects of surrogate parenting on depressive symp-\ntoms and on life satisfaction, followed by the decomposition\ninto direct and indirect effects.\nLife Changes\nWe expected that surrogate parenting should lead to declines\nin work hours, income, health, and social contacts and to in-\ncreases in social supports. The data only partially support these\nhypotheses (see Table 3). Men but not women (gender interac-\ntion b = 13.22, p < .05) experience a significant decline in work\nhours when grandchildren stay in the household, whereas grand-\nchildren's moves into or out of the household have no impact on\nwork hours. At the same time, continued stays of grandchildren\nin the household apparently are associated with an increase in\nincome for men but not women (gender interaction b = -2.22,\np < .05). There are no significant effects of the surrogate parent-\ning variables on changes in health.\nSeveral of the social contact variables (church attendance,\nparticipation in social church events, socializing with neigh-\nbors, and going to a bar or tavern) are affected by surrogate par-\nenting responsibilities. Grandmothers who assume surrogate\nparenting report a decline in church-related activities (both at-\ntendance and socializing), whereas grandfathers' church activi-\nties are not significantly influenced by surrogate parenting.\nHowever, the gender interaction is not significant. On the other\nhand, grandfathers report reduced participation in social church\nevents when grandchildren stay in the home and an increase in\nsuch activities when the grandchildren move out. Again, the\ngender interactions are not significant. In the case of church at-\ntendance, there is a significant race interaction for women (b =\n31.15, /? < .05), indicating that it is primarily White women\nwho reduce their church attendance when grandchildren move\ninto their homes. Socializing with neighbors increases among\nwomen but not men whose grandchildren moved out of the\nhousehold (gender interaction b = .93, p < .05). Grandfathers\nTable 3.

The gender interactions are, however, not signifi-\ncant. Men seem more prone than women to receive additional\nadvice from friends or relatives when grandchildren move into\nthe household (gender interaction b = -.28, p < .05), but the ef-\nfect itself is not significant.\nWeil-Being (Direct Effects)\nAccording to our theoretical model, grandchildren's moving\ninto and remaining in the household should reduce well-being,\nwhereas grandchildren's leaving the household should enhance\nwell-being. The data confirm that the beginning of surrogate\nparenting (grandchildren moving in) takes its toll especially on\ngrandmothers' well-being. As shown in Table 4, women's de-\npressive symptoms increase when grandchildren move into the\nhousehold. Further analyses (not shown in the table) suggest\nthat starting surrogate parenting for grandchildren with neither\nparent in the household is particularly detrimental to grand-\nmothers' well-being as indicated by depressive symptoms (b =\nmoving in for Model 1 in Table 4). However, only a few of the\nNSFH grandmothers fall into the latter category (N = 19).\nAlthough similar effects of grandchildren's move into the\nhousehold do not appear for grandfathers, the gender interac-\ntions are not significant.\nOverall, long-term stays of grandchildren in the household\ndo not appear to significantly induce more depressive symp-\ntoms in grandparents. However, additional analyses (not shown\nin Table 4) suggest that continued presence of grandchildren\nwith their parent in the household does enhance grandmothers'\nTable 4.

Thus,\nincreases in grandmothers' depressive symptoms on becoming\nsurrogate parents are very slightly enhanced through decreased\nchurch attendance. As noted earlier, this seems to apply mostly\nto White women. On the other hand, participation in social\nchurch events seems to exert a buffering function as indicated\nby the negative indirect effect, that is, participation in social\nchurch events slightly reduces the effect of surrogate parenting\non depressive symptoms. There are no significant indirect ef-\nfects for life satisfaction.\nCONCLUSION\nThe main purpose of our analyses was to determine whether\ngrandchildren's movement into and out of grandparents' house-\nholds influences selected grandparent characteristics as well\nas their psychological well-being. In addition, we assessed\nwhether the influence of surrogate parenting is direct or medi-\nated through selected life changes and whether it differs by gen-\nder and race.\nOur data provide only limited evidence that surrogate parent-\ning brings about significant changes in grandparents' lives (at\nleast those life spheres considered here). Although several char-\nacteristics (e.g., work hours and religious activities) relate sig-\nnificantly to surrogate parenting, the effects are so small ((3 <\n.10) that one can hardly speak of a major impact. The only ex-\nceptions are increased bar/tavern visits among grandfathers (P\n= .11) and increased instrumental supports from relatives\namong grandmothers who started surrogate parenting (P = .16).\nApparently grandmothers are able to secure help, especially\nfrom relatives, when grandchildren move into the household.\nAs grandfathers' experience with surrogate parenting is typi-\ncally as spouses (82% of those who started surrogate parenting\nare married), their enhanced bar/tavern visits could signify an\nescape from their homes once grandchildren move in. These\nfindings contrast with some earlier studies (Burton, 1992;\noration in various life spheres on becoming surrogate parents\nbut are in line with other research that also found little impact\nof surrogate parenting on health or work hours (Pruchno, 1999;\nSands & Goldberg-Glen, 1998). Potential effects of surrogate\nparenting on grandparents' lives most likely are contingent on\nthe circumstances under which grandparents assume this re-\nsponsibility. Although many earlier studies focused on surro-\ngate parenting under particularly difficult circumstances (e.g.,\ndrug abuse by the parents, or incarceration; see Dressel &\ndata sets such as the NSFH or Pruchno's (1999) study probably\ninclude a greater variety of surrogate parents. Because the\nNSFH does not contain information on the reasons for grand-\nchildren's presence in the household, we cannot determine\nwhether grandparents who assume surrogate parenting under\nparticularly difficult circumstances experience more adverse ef-\nfects on their health, finances, or social contacts. Furthermore,\nsample selection bias and attrition may have eliminated some\nindividuals who experienced the most detrimental effects of\nsurrogate parenting.\nOur second research question addressed the influence of sur-\nrogate parenting on grandparents' psychological well-being.\nAlthough our results corroborate earlier research indicating a\ndecline in well-being among grandmothers who assume surro-\nare again quite small. Methodological features of our study (the\nuse of residualized gain scores, and the skewed distribution of\ngrandparents with and without surrogate parenting responsibili-\nties in the NSFH) are likely to produce small effects. For exam-\nple, other stressful life events (other than changes in health)\nsuch as changes in marital status or beginning of caregiving ac-\ntivities yield similar small effects. Nevertheless, methodological\nissues alone are unlikely to account for our results. Several\nother issues may also play a role. Once again the composition\nof surrogate parents in the NSFH may contribute to smaller ef-\nfects. Furthermore, surrogate parenting prevails among already\ndisadvantaged population groups (Fuller-Thomson, Minkler, &\ndeterioration in various life spheres and in well-being over time\nregardless of surrogate parenting responsibilities. In smaller\nstudies it is typically not feasible to control for such influences.\nComparisons of the models in Tables 4 and 5 (and additional\nmodels not shown in the tables) indicate that controlling for\nmajor demographic characteristics (age, marital status, educa-\ntion, and presence of dependent children in the household)\nreduces the impact of surrogate parenting on well-being in the\ncase of life satisfaction to a nonsignificant level. It is conceivable\nthat grandparents attribute decreased well-being to the assump-\ntion of surrogate parenting even though other factors may be at\nleast partially responsible. Strawbridge et al. (1997) reported,\nfor example, that most grandparent caregivers suffered from\npoor health and other stressful life conditions well before they\nbecame surrogate parents. However, similar to our study, de-\npressive symptoms increased after the assumption of surrogate\nparenting. In addition, previous research indicates that grand-\nparents also derive psychological benefits from surrogate par-\nables included in the NSFH would reflect both positive and\nnegative effects of surrogate parenting, resulting in overall\nsmaller effects (i.e., positive and negative effects cancel each\nother out to some extent).\nLittle is known about grandfathers who are surrogate parents\n(or who are married to grandmothers who assume surrogate\nparenting functions). Although grandchildren's move into the\nhousehold seems to exert some stresses on grandfathers (sug-\ngested by nonsignificant gender interactions and grandfathers'\nmore frequent visits to bars/taverns after grandchildren move\nin), grandchildren's presence also appears to have some benefi-\ncial effects on grandfathers' well-being. This is indicated by an\nincrease in depressive symptoms when the grandchildren leave\nthe household. If, as some research suggests (Minkler & Roe,\nstrongly involved in the care of custodial grandchildren, they\nmay derive benefits (e.g., companionship, or a new familial\nfocus, especially in the case of a dissatisfactory marital relation-\nship) from grandchildren's presence and miss these benefits\nwhen the grandchildren move out. Hayslip et al. (1998)\nshowed, for example, that custodial grandfathers attach a more\npositive meaning to the grandparent role than both noncustodial\ngrandfathers and custodial grandmothers. Furthermore, custo-\ndial grandfathers with low-problem grandchildren scored\nhigher on psychosocial satisfaction than their female counter-\nparts. Their more detached role in childrearing (Baranowski,\nheaval created by adult children's or grandchildren's problems,\nas indicated by their tendency to seek relief in out-of-the home\nentertainment (visits to bars/taverns).\nWe find no significant race differences in the influence of\nsurrogate parenting on well-being. However, because the cir-\ncumstances under which grandparents assume surrogate par-\nenting responsibilities vary by race (e.g., Black grandmothers\nare more likely than White grandmothers to have grandchildren\nwithout their parents in the home), this certainly does not mean\nthat the experience of surrogate parenting does not differ by\nrace. For example, African American grandparents may assume\nsurrogate parenting under more difficult circumstances but be\nmore able than White grandparents to secure and maintain so-\ncial supports that buffer the effect of surrogate parenting on\nwell-being (Scott & Black, 1994). The small number of surro-\ngate parents in our data also may obscure race differences.\nWe further explored the mediating effect of other life\nchanges on relationships between surrogate parenting and well-\nbeing. Although path analyses reveal only marginal mediating\neffects, the trends suggested by the data are somewhat more\ncomplex. As already noted, surrogate parenting covaries with\ndemographic characteristics (e.g., marital status and education),\nwhich also predict changes in psychological well-being over\ntime. This implies that some surrogate parents may be particu-\nlarly vulnerable to a deterioration both in various life spheres\nand in their well-being over time. Because we controlled for\nthese demographic characteristics in our analyses, we elimi-\nnated potential spurious relationships between such other life\nchanges and well-being. Moreover, comparisons of Models 1\nand 3 in Tables 4 and 5 reveal that inclusion of health, income,\nemployment, and social contacts and supports (without the de-\nmographic variables) does reduce the effect of surrogate parent-\ning on well-being. This trend is more pronounced for life satis-\nfaction but also applies to depressive symptoms. This would\nsuggest that some of the impact of surrogate parenting on well-\nbeing is indeed attributable to a deterioration in these character-\nistics. However, it appears to be the cumulative effect of small\ndecreases in several characteristics rather than mediation\nthrough one or two specific characteristics that accounts for our\nfindings.\nBecause our results differ to some extent from those docu-\nmented in earlier studies, it is essential to assess limitations in\nour data and other factors that may account for such discrepan-\ncies. Large surveys such as the NSFH rarely include the in-\ndepth information that can be obtained through smaller and\nmore qualitative studies. For instance, we lack information on\nthe reasons why grandchildren moved into the household, be-\nhavioral and other problems exhibited by the grandchildren,\nconflicts with the grandchildren's parents, or additional out-\ncome variables that may distinguish between benefits and costs\nof surrogate parenting. In addition, grandmothers with severe\nproblems may have been particularly likely to refuse participa-\ntion in a national survey and were more prone to attrition, so\nthat the most vulnerable groups are probably underrepresented.\nThe small number of surrogate parents in the sample and attri-\ntion of the most vulnerable groups may have resulted in overly\nconservative estimates of surrogate parenting effects. It is also\npossible that the circumstances leading to surrogate parenting\nmay have already undermined grandparents' well-being before\nthe actual transition to surrogate parenting. Such changes would\nnot be evident in an analysis that focuses on change over time.\nThe relatively long time lag between the NSFH waves also may\ncontribute to our results. Grandparents may adjust to their sur-\nrogate parenting responsibilities over time. Initial declines in\ngrandparents' situation immediately after assuming surrogate\nparenting which are followed by improvement over time as\ngrandparents adapt to their new circumstances would again\ndiminish the total effect shown in these two-wave data. Mea-\nsurement issues also may have affected our results. Several mea-\nsures used here (e.g., health, and life satisfaction) rely on single\nitems with questionable reliability.\nAlthough data limitations may be responsible for some of\nour findings, the design of earlier studies could also have con-\ntributed to their results. Many previous studies focused on spe-\ncial groups of surrogate parents, especially low-income Black\ngrandmothers whose adult children experienced severe prob-\nlems such as drug addictions, imprisonment, or life-threatening\nmothers are already vulnerable, they may be more affected by\nsurrogate parenting than grandparents covered by a representa-\ntive national survey. In addition, many of the samples used in\nearlier investigations were recruited from support groups for\ngrandparents raising grandchildren or from diverse social agen-\nagain, this may have led to a bias favoring those grandparents\nwho experience pronounced problems or those least able to\ndeal with surrogate parenting responsibilities. In addition, the\nreliance on retrospective accounts may obscure causal relation-\nships (Kosloski, McGlinn Datwyler, & Montgomery, 1994). It\nis quite possible that grandmothers may attribute diverse prob-\nlems to their surrogate parenting situation even though these\nproblems predate this living arrangement or derive from other\nfactors such as poverty. These differences in study designs may\nvery well account for discrepancies in findings. If this is the\ncase, then the severe problems associated with surrogate par-\nenting in some earlier studies cannot be generalized to the total\npopulation of custodial grandparents. Rather, the consequences\nof surrogate parenting responsibilities seem to be context\ndependent.\nIn view of the relatively large proportion of surrogate parents\nespecially among minorities (Casper & Bryson, 1998; Fuller-\nclearly needed to reconcile the findings from this and other\nstudies. Particularly useful would be representative and longitu-\ndinal studies of grandparents that include in-depth measures of\npsychological well-being, indicators of life quality such as\nhealth, employment, and social contacts, and detailed informa-\ntion on the circumstances leading to the surrogate parent ar-\nrangement as well as on the specific problems encountered by\nthe grandparents and the grandchildren. Relationships between\nthe grandparents and the grandchildren's parents (regardless of\nwhether they reside in the household) should also be investi-\ngated. Such studies should be conducted in relatively short in-\ntervals over a prolonged time period to capture both the initial\nadjustment problems during the transition to surrogate parent-\ning and the grandparents' adaptation over time. In addition,\ngrandmothers and grandfathers (and perhaps other family mem-\nbers such as adult and dependent children in the household) as\nwell as divergent racial or ethnic groups should be participants\nin such research. Such a broader family systems perspective\nwould enable researchers to identify the impact of surrogate\nparenting on divergent family members and to analyze how\nfamily members share (or do not share) care for the grandchil-\ndren. In addition, careful assessment of the conditions (e.g.,\nadult children's presence in the home, socioeconomic and\nhealth status before becoming a surrogate parent, reasons for\nsurrogate parenting, grandchildren's problems, and extent of\ncare) that promote or hinder adaptation to surrogate parenting\nwould be particularly helpful to identify reasons for gender and\nrace differences and to develop successful interventions and\nprograms.\n"
