Several studies have reported that obesity is\nassociated with increased risk of high-grade prostate\ncancer and prostate cancer mortality, and it is thus\nlikely that the increase in obesity has increased the\nburden of prostate cancer. In this study, we assess\nthe potential effect of increasing obesity on prostate\ncancer incidence and mortality. We first estimate\nobesity-associated relative risks of low- and high-grade\nprostate cancer using data from the Prostate Cancer\nPrevention Trial. Then, using obesity prevalence data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey and prostate cancer incidence data from the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program,\nwe convert annual grade-specific prostate cancer\nincidence rates into incidence rates conditional on\nweight category. Next, we combine the conditional inci-\ndence rates with the 1980 prevalence rates for each\nweight category to project annual grade-specific inci-\ndence under 1980 obesity levels. We use a simulation\nmodel based on observed survival and mortality data to\ntranslate the effects of obesity trends on prostate cancer\nincidence into effects on disease-specific mortality.\nThe predicted increase in obesity prevalence since 1980\nincreased high-grade prostate cancer incidence by\n15.5% and prostate cancer mortality by between 7.0%\n(under identical survival for obese and nonobese cases)\nand 23.0% (under different survival for obese and\nnonobese cases) in 2002. We conclude that increasing\nobesity prevalence since 1980 has partially obscured\ndeclines in prostate cancer mortality. (Cancer Epide-\n",

For example,\ndata from Austria, the United States, and the United\nKingdom show that populations with high PSA screen-\ning rates have lower prostate cancer mortality rates than\npopulations with low uptake of screening (5, 6). In\naddition to trends in treatment and screening practices,\nit is important to consider trends in population-level\nrisk exposures such as obesity.\nindex (BMI) z30 kg/m2] prevalence rates in men ages 40\nto 74 years more than doubled in the United States, from\nprevalence rates remained relatively constant at around\n44% over this time period (see Fig. 1; ref. 7). Obesity has\nbeen associated with a greater incidence of high-grade\nprostate cancer (8-11), with poorer disease-specific\nsurvival (12) and clinical outcomes after cancer treatment\n(13), and with worse other-cause survival (14).\nThe association between obesity and high-grade\nprostate cancer is biologically plausible because obesity\nis associated with marked alterations in the serum con-\ncentrations of numerous hormones such as estrogen, tes-\ntosterone, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, all of\nwhich have been linked to prostate cancer, and leptin,\nwhich has been associated with high-grade prostate\ncancer (15-18). Obesity is also associated with increased\nlevels of several biomarkers related to inflammation,\nincluding interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-a (19).\nA number of publications have shown that chronic\ninflammation is associated with proliferative inflamma-\ntory lesions that may be precursors of prostate tumors\nThe association between obesity and low-grade pros-\ntate cancer is less clear. Although some studies have\nalso linked obesity with a modestly reduced incidence of\nlow-grade disease (11, 23), others have found no asso-\nciation (8, 24, 25). Several studies have found that obese\nmen have very slightly decreased PSA levels (26-28)\nand enlarged prostates (29, 30). Thus, obese men with\nGrant support: Research supported by National Cancer Institute/NIH U01-CA88160\nRequests for reprints: Ruth Ethioni, 1100 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\nCopyright D 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nprostate cancer may be less likely to be referred to\nbiopsy, and obese men receiving biopsies may be more\nlikely to receive false-negative results (31). However,\nthere is much uncertainty about whether these potential\ndiagnostic biases could substantially affect rates of low-\ngrade disease.\nGiven that obesity is associated with worse high-grade\nincidence and survival, and given that its protective\neffects for low-grade cancer are likely modest, the fact\nthat mortality has declined despite increasing obesity\nsuggests that even greater gains could have been seen\nhad obesity rates remained constant over time. In this\nstudy, we investigate the extent to which the increasing\nprevalence of obesity has increased prostate cancer\nincidence and mortality in the United States. Our\ninvestigation uses data on grade-specific disease inci-\ndence, the annual prevalence of obesity in the United\nStates, and information from the Prostate Cancer\nPrevention Trial (PCPT) on the link between obesity\nand grade-specific incidence. With this information, we\nestimate the grade-specific prostate cancer incidence that\nwould have been observed had the prevalence of obesity\nprojected and observed trends. We then use survival data\nto translate the difference between the grade-specific\nincidence curves under projected and observed trends\ninto the effect of the observed increase in obesity on age-\nadjusted mortality.\nMaterials and Methods\nOur method to project grade-specific prostate cancer\nincidence had overweight and obese prevalence rates\ncomponents: (a) calculating grade-specific incidence\n(healthy, overweight, and obese) and (b) the conditional\ngrade-specific incidence rates on weight category toge-\nther with 1980 prevalence rates of each weight category\nto project overall, or unconditional, grade-specific inci-\ndence rates under 1980 obesity levels. Both components\nrely on weight trend data, patterns of prostate cancer\nincidence, and relative risks of low- and high-grade\ncancer associated with being overweight and obese.\nTrends in Overweight and Obese Prevalence Rates\nin the United States.

The NHANES survey questions\nare administered to a nationally representative sample of\nindividuals, and the survey results are extrapolated to\nproduce estimates for the general population. NHANES\ntherefore, our analysis is limited to men ages 40 to\n74 y.

To obtain risk esti-\nmates appropriate for weight categories consistent with\nNHANES definitions and grade categories consistent\nwith SEER, we reanalyzed data from the PCPT.\nThe PCPT was a randomized controlled trial con-\nducted to investigate the efficacy of finasteride as a\nchemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. The trial\nenrolled 18,880 healthy men to receive either placebo or\nfinasteride and provided annual prostate cancer screen-\ning for up to 7 y of follow up. Our analysis considers the\n911 participants diagnosed with prostate cancer after for-\ncause biopsy (i.e., biopsy triggered by suspicious PSA or\ndigital rectal examination results) relative to the 9,347\nparticipants who underwent end-of-study biopsy and\ntherefore have known disease status. These definitions of\ncase and control populations circumvent a potential\nproblem in this data set if associations of obesity with\ncases diagnosed without cause (i.e., detections among\nend-of-study biopsies) differed from those diagnosed\nunder standard clinical practice. A prior analysis of these\nincreased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason\ncontrast, BMI z 30 was associated with an 18% decreased\nrisk of low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score 2-7)\ncompared with BMI < 25.\nTo use risk estimates appropriate for NHANES weight\ncategories, we reanalyzed the PCPT data considered in\nGong et al. (23). First, we constructed NHANES weight\ncategories w = 1, 2, 3 for healthy weight (BMI < 25),\nthen estimated grade-specific relative risks for categories\n2 and 3 relative to 1 via Poisson regression modeling of\nindividual-level observations, adjusting for age, race,\nfamily history of prostate cancer, diabetes status, and\nfinasteride arm. The Poisson regressions yielded relative\nrisks rgw\nfor overweight low-grade (rL2\n), overweight\nhigh-grade (rH2\n), obese low-grade (rL3\n), and obese high-\ngrade (rH3\n) prostate cancer incidence relative to healthy\nweight men.\nGrade-Specific Incidence Trends Conditional on\nWeight Categories. We used the estimated relative risks\nto obtain annual grade-specific prostate cancer incidence\nconditional on weight category. By the law of total\nprobability, the unconditional incidence rate for grade g\nand year y given age group a can be written as follows:\nIg\n\u00f0yja\u00de \u00bc X\nw\nIg\n\u00f0yja; w\u00dePy\n\u00f0wja\u00de; \u00f0A\u00de\nwhere Ig\n(y|a, w) denotes the incidence rate for grade g,\nyear y, age group a, and weight category w, and Py\n(w|a)\nrepresents the prevalence of weight category w in year y\ngiven age group a (with, fw\nPy\n(w|a) = 1). Using the\nrelative risks rgw\nfor g = L; H and w = 2, 3 estimated\nfrom the PCPT data we have:\nIg\n\u00f0yja; w\u00de \u00bc rgw\nIg\nWe can now replace the terms for overweight and\nobese incidence in (1) with healthy weight incidence\nscaled by the risk of disease for individuals in these\nweight categories relative to healthy weight individuals.\nConsequently, for each grade g, year y, and age group a,\nwe have one equation in one unknown and can solve\nequation (A) for healthy weight incidence. With this\nsolution, we immediately obtain incidence for overweight\nand obese individuals using the estimated relative risks.\nProjecting Grade-Specific Incidence Trends under\n1980 Obesity Levels. To project grade-specific incidence\nassuming that overweight and obese prevalence rates\nhad remained constant at 1980 levels, we use the\nconditional grade-specific incidence rates computed\nabove together with prevalence rates observed in 1980\nas follows to approximate the expected incidence by\ngrade, year, and age group:\nIe\ng\n\u00f0yja\u00de \u00bc X\nw\nIg\n\u00f0wja\u00de:\nHere, the notation f designates unconditional grade-\nspecific incidence under constant 1980 overweight and\nobese prevalence rates. Comparing Ig\n(y|a) with I\nf\ng\n(y|a)\nallows us to estimate the effect of the observed increase\nin obesity in the United States on prostate cancer\nincidence. To quantify the uncertainty in our estimates\ndue to uncertainty in the estimated relative risks, we also\nestimate the effect of increasing obesity on high-grade\nprostate cancer incidence using end points of the 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI) for the relative risks.\nAs a by-product of this calculation, we can estimate\nobesity distributions among prostate cancer cases by\ngrade, year, and age group using Bayes theorem:\nPy\n\u00f0wja; g\u00de \u00bc\nIg\n\u00f0yja; w\u00de Py\n\u00f0wja\u00de\nP\nw\nIg\n\u00f0yja; w\u00de Py\n\u00f0wja\u00de\n;\nwhere Py\n(w|a, g) is the proportion of cases diagnosed in\nyear, age group, and grade who decrease into weight\ncategory w. This ability to classify the low- and high-\ngrade cases by obesity status at diagnosis is useful when\nwe translate the effect of obesity on incidence into its\neffect on mortality.\nEffect on Mortality. To translate the effect on\nincidence into the effect on mortality, we use a micro-\nsimulation model of prostate cancer and other-cause\ndeath given grade-specific incidence patterns. The model\nfirst generates populations to match case counts by age\ngroup, year, and grade corresponding to observed and\nprojected incidence rates Ig\n(y|a) and I\nf\ng\n(y|a). Each case is\nassigned a disease-specific and other-cause survival time\nfrom the date of diagnosis. Both survival times are\nallowed to depend on obesity status at diagnosis, which\nis assigned based on obesity distributions obtained as\ndescribed above.\nWe consider two prostate cancer survival hazard ratios\nfor obese men: hpc = 1 (no effect of obesity on disease-\nspecific survival) and hpc = 2:6 (obesity adversely\naffects disease-specific survival). These hazard ratios\nrepresent the instantaneous risk of death in obese versus\nnonobese prostate cancer cases. The latter hazard ratio\nwas estimated by Gong et al. (34) for men ages 40 to\nestimate is remarkably similar to that reported by Ma\net al. (35), who found a hazard ratio of 2.66 for obese\nversus nonobese prostate cancer cases in the Physicians\nHealth Study. Analogous to our method for obtaining\nCancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nincidence rates by weight category using relative risks, we\npartition SEER cause-specific survival curves by age and\nyear of diagnosis into weight category\u00adspecific sur-\nvival curves by noting that each corresponding hazard\nfunction is a weighted combination of the hazard\nfunctions for obese and nonobese with the weights given\nby the obesity distributions. For any hazard ratio of\nprostate cancer death, we can therefore solve for the\nsurvival among nonobese cases and use the hazard ratio\nto obtain survival among obese cases. The obese and\nnonobese cause\u00adspecific survival curves are derived\nunder observed obesity trends in the population. The\nsimulation model uses these curves to produce mortality\nprojections corresponding to grade-specific incidence\nunder both observed weight trends and under constant\nSimilarly, we consider two other-cause survival\nhazard ratios for obese men: hoc = 1 (no effect of obesity\non disease-specific survival) and (h1\n65 to 74 y (obesity adversely affects disease-specific\nsurvival). The latter set was estimated by Davis et al.\n(36). We assume that all-cause mortality hazard ratios\nare adequate approximations of other-cause mortality\nhazard ratios.\nEach case in the model is assigned a date of death\ngiven by the minimum of the dates of cause-specific and\nother-cause death; cause of death is assigned according-\nly. The model tabulates prostate cancer deaths by grade\nat diagnosis and age and year at death. The difference\nbetween the prostate cancer deaths under observed and\nconstant 1980 weight trends each year is age-adjusted\nand subtracted from observed mortality to project\nmortality trends had BMI prevalence rates remained at\n1980 levels. Differences between the observed and pro-\njected mortality counts are inflated to the US population\nto estimate the number of excess deaths nationally due\nto observed increases in BMI in the population. To limit\nrandom variation due to the simulation model, results\nof 50 independent runs are averaged to produce the\nfinal results.\nTo validate our model projections, we compare\nincidence-based mortality since 1980 (i.e., prostate\ncancer deaths among cases diagnosed after 1980 as a\npercentage of the population) observed in SEER and\ncorresponding incidence-based mortality projected un-\nder observed obesity trends. This provides an opportu-\nnity to check that the overall number of deaths produced\nby the model reasonably approximates that observed in\npractice.\nResults\nTable 2 reports cross-tabulation of Gleason grades and\nBMI categories for PCPT cases.

Considering data from all participants, we found\nthat obesity (BMI z 30) was associated with a nonsig-\nnificant decreased risk of low-grade prostate cancer. In\ncontrast, obesity was associated with a significant 79%\nincreased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Consistent\nwith Gong et al. (23), we found that the higher risk\nof low- and high-grade prostate cancer for obese men\nwas similar across study arms. They defined low-grade\nTable 2.

In recent\nyears, evidence linking obesity with adverse outcomes in\nprostate cancer has accumulated, but the likely popula-\ntion effects have not been quantified. We used NHANES\ndata on overweight and obesity prevalence rates in\nconjunction with disease incidence, survival, and mor-\ntality data from SEER to quantify how prostate cancer\ntrends have been affected by the increase in obesity in\nthis country. We estimated that increasing BMI levels\nsince 1980 may have decreased low-grade incidence by\n1.3% and increased high-grade incidence by 15.5%. In\naddition, we estimated that these trends may have\nincreased prostate cancer deaths by between 7.0% (under\nobesity-independent disease-specific and other-cause\nsurvival rates) and 23.0% (under different survival for\nobese and nonobese cases) in 2002. Our findings suggest\nthat despite the dramatic declines in prostate cancer\nmortality observed since 1992, deaths from the disease\nmight have declined even further had obesity prevalence\nrates not simultaneously increased.\nThis study has several limitations. Although NHANES\nis an excellent source of population-based obesity data,\nthe NHANES survey was conducted intermittently\nseveral years. We interpolated overweight and obesity\nlevels for years with no survey data, assuming that\noverweight and obesity levels followed linear trends in\nthe interim. In addition, our computations of grade-\nspecific incidence given weight category in a given year\nand our estimates of the obesity-associated relative risks\nof low- and high-grade disease are based on current\nobesity status and do not take into account obesity\nhistory or duration. Although it is likely that the risk of\nprostate cancer at any given age depends on risk factors\naccumulated over several years, neither the NHANES\ndata on obesity prevalence nor the PCPT data on risk of\ndisease associated with obesity provide information on\nindividual obesity histories. Our mortality simulation\nmodel allows obese and nonobese men to have different\nrisks of prostate cancer death, but the magnitude of the\nincrease in risk due to obesity is still uncertain. Some\nstudies do not find a significant increase in risk, and\nalthough a number of studies have found a positive\nassociation, only two (34, 35) provide estimates of the\nrelative risk. Because the effect on mortality is highly\ndependent on how obesity affects the risk of prostate\ncancer death over and above its effect on high-grade\nincidence, it will be important to refine the estimate of\nthe obesity-associated risk of prostate cancer death\nprovided as input to the model as more information\nbecomes available. Thus, the uncertainty inherent in our\nmortality estimates is greater than what is reflected in\nCIs and may be reduced as more specific model inputs\nbecome available.\nIn conclusion, current evidence indicates that trends in\nobesity have likely increased the incidence of high-grade\nprostate cancer over time, with a nontrivial effect on\nprostate cancer mortality through 2002. We conclude\nthat in the absence of increasing prevalence of obesity,\nthe decline in prostate cancer mortality in the United\nStates would have been noticeably more pronounced\nthan was observed. This analysis underscores the com-\nplexity of the determinants of prostate cancer inci-\ndence and mortality trends and shows that it is likely\nthat these trends depend on factors beyond screening\nand treatment.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\n"
