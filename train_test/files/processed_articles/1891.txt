This study\nexamined trends in the frequency distribution of mid-\nAC and corresponding recommended BP cuff sizes\nusing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nBoth surveys used a complex sample design to obtain\nnationally representative samples of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized US population. The sample consisted of\nmid-AC (cm) and associated American Heart Associa-\ntion-defined cuff sizes were assessed. Variables were\nanalysed by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and by hyper-\ntension or diabetic co-morbidity. Mid-AC increased\nsignificantly between surveys for all age groups; the\ngreatest increase in mid-AC occurred in the 20\u00ad39 year\namong nonHispanic white and nonHispanic black men\nAmong NHB women aged 40 years and above, the mean\nmid-AC was greater than or equal to 34 cm. In all, 42% of\nlarge BP cuffs. In all, 39% of individuals classified as\nhypertensive and 47% of self-reported diabetics re-\nquired a BP cuff greater than the standard adult size.\nIn conclusion, mean mid-AC has increased across many\ndemographic subgroups in the US with implications for\nthe accuracy of BP measurement in clinical practice.\nKeywords: mid-arm circumference; NHANES; health survey; blood pressure determination\nIntroduction\nAccurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is a\nmajor public health concern: it is essential for\nhypertension screening, as well as for disease\nof the US adult population (58.4 million Americans)\nwere hypertensive.1 Intra-individual, observer, equip-\nment, and environmental factors can influence BP\nmeasurement accuracy.2,3 With respect to measure-\nment accuracy, the choice of an appropriate cuff size\nfor BP measurement is a critical factor.4\u00ad8 A bladder\nwidth that is too narrow for the mid-arm circumfer-\nence (AC) will tend to overestimate BP, potentially\nresulting in `cuff hypertension.' A bladder width that\nis too wide for the AC results in underestimates or\nincorrectly low BP readings.9,10 Using inappropri-\nately sized BP cuffs in obese individuals may result\nin more biased BP readings than in nonobese\npersons,11 and there may potentially be measurement\nproblems generally in clinical populations.12\u00ad14\nRecent anthropometric data document an in-\ncreased prevalence of obesity among US adults.15\nAlso, another recent report16 demonstrated that\nincreased obesity in the US between 1988 and\n2000 resulted in a significant increase in the\nand an increased need for large adult BP cuffs (from\n42 to 45%). Since these initial reports, additional\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) population data collected between 2001\nand 2002 have become available. The new data are\nuseful for examining detailed trends in mid-AC and\nrecommended BP cuff size by specific demographic\nsubgroups, which may be differentially affected by\ntrends in obesity. This study examines trends in the\ndistribution of mid-AC and corresponding recom-\nmended BP cuff sizes over time by gender, age, and\nrace/ethnicity, and in special clinical subpopula-\ntions (hypertensive and diabetic persons).16 The\nCorrespondence: Dr Y Ostchega, National Center for Health\nE-mail: yxo1@cdc.gov\nwww.nature.com/jhh\nlatter represent important high-risk groups.

A complex, stratified, multistage probability\ncluster sampling design is used in the surveys.18\nThis report is based on an analysis of mid-AC data\nfor US adults 20 years of age and older in two\nindependent NHANES samples, NHANES III (1988\u00ad\nlatter represents the first four years of an ongoing,\ncontinuous survey. Informed consent was obtained\nfrom all participants, and the protocol was approved\nby the Institutional Review Board of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics.\nMeasurements\nParticipants were interviewed in their homes and\nlater examined in mobile examination centres\n(MECs).19 Mid-AC was measured in centimeters in\nthe MEC following a standard anthropometric\nprotocol which was identical for both NHANES III\nrecommendations can vary by the manufacturer, we\nused the American Heart Association definitions for\nrecommended BP cuff sizes.21 The mid-AC range for\nthe adult BP cuff size was 27\u00ad34 cm, for the large\nadult size, 35\u00ad44 cm; and for the adult thigh size,\nAC measures less than 27 cm (corresponding to\nchild and infant BP cuff sizes) and greater than\nsurvey participants. These were excluded from the\ncuff size analysis.\nAn individual was defined to have hypertension if\nat least one of the following conditions was satisfied:\na systolic BP of 140mmHg or more, a systolic BP of\n90mmHg or more, or currently taking medication to\nlower high BP. An average of up to three systolic and\ndiastolic BP readings was used in applying this\ndefinition to data from the third NHANES (1988\u00ad\ntension status. A sample person was defined to have\n`diagnosed diabetes' if the person reported ever having\nbeen diagnosed as diabetic by a physician.\nSample and statistical analysis\nParticipants 20 years of age and over with valid mid-\nAC measurement data numbered 7453 men and\n8372 women in NHANES III, a survey conducted\nyears of an ongoing survey. Survey sample response\nrates were similar in both surveys; 78% of the\nselected sample was examined. The study popula-\ntion was further stratified by race/ethnicity. Esti-\nmates of mean arm circumference and the percent of\nadults with adult, large adult and adult cuff size are\npresented for nonHispanic White (NHW), nonHis-\npanic Black (NHB), and Mexican Americans (MA).\nethnic distribution for persons 20 \u00fe in the US is\nclassifiable into one of these groups (11%) were\nincluded in the total population estimates but were\nnot separately reported.\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using SAS\n8.2 for Windows software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,\nUSA) and SUDAAN software (RTI, Research Trian-\ngle Park, NC, USA). All estimates were weighted;\nthe sample weights account for the unequal prob-\nabilities of selection resulting from the complex\nsample design, survey nonresponse, and the\nplanned over-sampling of selected population sub-\ngroups. Standard errors (s.e.) were estimated with\nSUDAAN using Taylor series linearization.22 For a\ngiven race/ethnic, gender, and age group and cuff\nsize, the absolute difference was defined as the\nmean or percentage of adults with a given cuff size\nfor NHANES III minus the corresponding mean\nequality of the mean mid-AC and the percentage\nwith a given cuff size between NHANES III and\nence was used. This statistic follows a t distribution.\nindependent surveys, the SE of the estimated\nabsolute difference can be estimated by the square\nroot of the sum of the squares of the SEs of the\nestimated means or percentages from NHANES III\nSignificance levels were adjusted with the\nBonferroni method to account for multiple compar-\nisons for three race/ethnicity groups (NHW, NHB,\nMexican-American) and three age groups (20\u00ad39,\ndata sets was performed using the direct method,\nemploying US Census population projected esti-\nmates for the year 2000 provided in the NHANES\nFinally, the relative standard error (r.s.e.) of the\nmean or percent, defined as the ratio of either the\ns.e.m. or the percent to the mean or percent times\n100, was used as a measure of the reliability of the\nestimate. In this paper, if the r.s.e. of the estimated\nmean or percent exceeded 30%, an asterisk was\nplaced beside it to indicate that it was unreliable.23\nUS demographic trends\nY Ostchega et al\nJournal of Human Hypertension\nResults\nTable 1 presents the mean values and the absolute\npercent change in mid-AC values from NHANES III\nand race/ethnicity.

MA women had a statisti-\ncally significant increase in the proportion of adults\nrequiring a standard adult cuff size BP cuff (58.1\u00ad\nAlthough adult thigh-size BP cuffs are appropriate\nonly for a small percentage of the US population\n(approximately 1 in 60 adults required such an\nappropriate cuff in the most recent survey), the need\nto use adult thigh cuffs almost doubled between\nthe two surveys. Currently 1.7% of the US adult\npopulation (or 3.3 million adults) require an adult\nthigh BP cuff size to accurately measure their BP.\nFinally, we performed an assessment of recom-\nmended BP cuff sizes among US hypertensives and\ndiabetics. Of 3136 individuals classified as hyper-\ncuff; and 2.6% (s.e. \u00bc 0.33%) needed an adult thigh\ncuff. Of 858 individuals classified as diabetic by\nself-report, 48.7% (s.e. \u00bc 2.4%) needed an adult cuff,\n42.8% (s.e. \u00bc 2.6%) needed a large adult cuff, and\n4.6% (s.e. \u00bc 0.9%) needed an adult thigh cuff.\nDiscussion\nOur estimates for age-specific and race/ethnicity-\nspecific mid-AC and population distributions for\nrecommended BP cuff sizes are based on NHANES\ndata, which have the advantage of standardized\nanthropometric examination data representative of\nthe US adult population 20 years of age and older.\nmits statistical comparisons. The cross-sectional de-\nsign of NHANES, however, means that mid-AC is not\nmeasured in the same individuals in the two surveys.\nTherefore, in a strict sense, our trend analysis is not\ncomparable to a longitudinal study. Also, we chose\nthe American Heart Association's definitions for\nrecommended BP cuff sizes as the basis of our\npresentation. While this is a widely accepted guide-\nline in the US, the selection of cut-off points for such\nguidelines, and even the design of BP cuffs them-\nselves, may vary among professional societies and\ninternationally.24\u00ad26 Both are subjects of continuing\nscientific debate; it is not our intention in this paper\nto endorse one set of criteria vs another.\nThe findings corroborate the recent recommenda-\nthe increasing body size of the US population, large\nadult and thigh cuffs must become more widely\navailable regardless of the device or setting.' The\nincrease in obesity in the US adult population and a\nconcomitant general increase in mid-AC mean that\npractitioners need to be especially careful to select\nBP cuff sizes appropriate to the individual patient.\nIn the ideal case, practitioners would measure mid-\nAC for each patient, calculate the cuff width to mid-\nAC ratio, and select a BP cuff based on this result.\nAlternately, one could select appropriate BP cuff\nsizes based on a person's measured height and\nweight, using standard tables recently produced.28\nGenerally, there appears to be the potential for\nincreasingly inaccurate BP readings and an over-\nestimation of patients in need of therapy for\nhypertension, particularly among overweight and\nobese persons. For perspective, the current AHA\nGuidelines recommend the use of a large size BP\ncuff for individuals when the mid-AC is equal to or\n2002 show that, for the first time, NHW and NHB\nmen aged 20\u00ad59 years have a group mean (average)\nmid-AC equal to or greater than 34 cm. The findings\nare quite different for women. Only NHB women\naged 40 years and older have a mean mid-AC greater\nthan or equal to 34 cm. Indeed, this finding is\nconsistent with our report on obesity and over-\nweight prevalence among NHB women aged 40\nyears and older; more than 50% were considered\nobese and more than 80% were considered over-\nweight or obese.15 These estimates were further\nsubstantiated by very recent analysis based on\n50% of NHB women in these age groups are obese\nand about 80% are overweight or obese.29\nThe data also show that the greatest relative\nincrease in need for large BP cuffs occurred in\nindividuals aged 20\u00ad39 years. Indeed, as recently\nreported,15 this age group demonstrated the largest\nincrease in obesity for men and the second largest\nincrease in obesity in women for the same time frame.\nThe analysis showed that the general trend\ntowards increased obesity and mid-AC is not\nconstant across all population subgroups. Specifi-\nUS demographic trends\nY Ostchega et al\nJournal of Human Hypertension\ncally, Mexican American women aged 20\u00ad39 years\nhad a statistically significant increase in the propor-\ntion requiring standard adult-sized BP cuffs needed\n68% of this group would be adequately fitted by\na standard adult BP cuff. This contradictory trend\nis puzzling. One possible explanation is that MA\nwomen aged 20\u00ad39 years actually decreased in\nweight or increased in height across the surveys,\nas both values are highly correlated with mid-AC.29\nThese findings will require additional research for\nproper explanation. The analyses provide detailed\ntrends in mid-AC and recommended BP cuff size by\nspecific demographic subgroups in the population,\nwhich may be differentially affected by trends in\nobesity.\nFinally, the findings also show that 39% of\nindividuals classified as hypertensive require fitting\nwith a BP cuff larger than the standard adult size,\nand an even higher percentage of individuals\nclassified as diabetic (47%) require a larger than\nadult-size cuff to correctly measure BP.\nSummary\nwomen aged 40\u00ad59 years currently require the use\nof large-sized rather than standard adult-sized BP\ncuffs for accurate BP measurement. The need for\nlarge-sized cuffs is also rapidly growing in the 20\u00ad39\nyear old age group. These population trends em-\nphasize the need for medical practitioner's to pay\nincreased attention to properly cuffing patients\nbefore BP measurement to obtain accurate readings.\nFor a summary of the findings see Table 3.\nReferences\n1 Hajjar I, Kotchen TA.
