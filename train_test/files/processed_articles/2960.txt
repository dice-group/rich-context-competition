Other factors that have been shown to exert a positive influence on direct\ninvestment are host country income, the level of development of the financial sector abroad\nand its openness to foreign bank entry as well as the profit margin to be had there. A number\nof studies also stress that foreign multinational banks are deterred by a high degree of country\nor political risk.\nA limitation of the previous work in this field is that most studies are only concerned with\nbanking FDI between developed countries and thus do not consider the distinctive framework\nconcerning various risk factors which is prevalent in emerging markets. Another drawback is\nthat many studies use relatively dated time series which inhibits analysis of the changed\nfinancial market conditions in the aftermath of the Asian crisis. This paper aims to close this\ngap by focussing on FDI flows into emerging markets exclusively and using data from the\nmid-1990s onward. It analyzes the factors crucial in the locational decisions of multinational\nGerman banks in selected emerging markets of central and eastern Europe, Latin America and\nAsia. Emphasis is placed on testing variables of macroeconomic and financial sector risk\nalong with measures of bank-client integration and host country market characteristics. As an\ninnovation in this strand of FDI research, a variable taken from the literature on \"early\nwarning indicators\" which measures the backing of short-term banking deposits by\ninternational currency reserves is put to econometric testing.\nThe estimation outcome makes a strong case for the devastating impact of looming banking\ncrises. In almost all regressions, this crisis variable shows a highly significantly negative\ncorrelation with normalized FDI flows (dependent variable: absolute FDI divided by host\ncountry GDP). Other exogenous variables tested to have a strong pull effect are, as expected,\nagglomeration effects in terms of non-banking FDI of German firms and financial market\ndevelopment measured by stock market capitalization relative to GDP. By contrast, per-capita\nincome, country risk and openness of the financial sector abroad play a lesser role. Profit\nconsiderations cannot be shown to have an influence at all. The significance of the variable of\ntrade linkages is not robust.\nDisaggregation of the sample by region illustrates that the factors which are at work differ\nbetween the continents. While for the small sample of European countries economic growth is\nthe distinguishing positive factor along with the absence of banking crises, German banks in\nLatin America were drawn into locations that are considered financial centers, and Asian host\ncountries were chosen according to strong inflows of non-financial German FDI. Comparing\npre- and post-Asian-crisis time periods, it is found that both variables of country riskiness\ngain significance in the later sub-sample, with the result being especially pronounced for the\nmeasure of financial vulnerability. This finding indicates that German banks learned from the\nAsian debacle, adjusting their holdings when the viability of the foreign financial system was\nincreasingly deemed at risk or proportionally shunning risky banking environments\naltogether.\nThe main conclusion of the paper is that in addition to traditional macroeconomic variables\nmeasures of country, and, more specifically, financial sector risk, influencing the variability\nof expected earnings, should also be taken into account when assessing the determinants of\nforeign bank entry.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nIn der Literatur zu ausl\u00e4ndischen Direktinvestitionen (,,foreign direct investment\" \u00ad ,,FDI\")\ndes Finanzsektors finden die meisten Studien eine enge Beziehung zwischen FDI und\nbilateraler Handelsverflechtung sowie der Entscheidung von Nichtbanken zum Markteintritt\nin Schwellenl\u00e4ndern \u00ad ein Ph\u00e4nomen, das \u00fcblicherweise als ,,follow the client\"-Motiv\nbezeichnet wird. Andere Faktoren, f\u00fcr die ein positiver Einfluss auf Direktinvestitionen\nnachgewiesen worden ist, umfassen das Volkseinkommen des Empf\u00e4ngerlandes, den\nEntwicklungsgrad des dortigen Finanzsektors und seine Offenheit gegen\u00fcber dem Zutritt\nausl\u00e4ndischer Banken sowie die dort zu erzielende Gewinnmarge. Eine Reihe von Studien\nbetont zudem, dass multinationale Banken durch hohes L\u00e4nder- bzw. politisches Risiko\nabgeschreckt werden.\nEin Manko der bisherigen Arbeiten auf diesem Gebiet liegt darin, dass die meisten\nUntersuchungen sich nur mit Direktinvestitionen zwischen Industriel\u00e4ndern befassen und\nsomit nicht die unterschiedlichen Rahmenbedingungen hinsichtlich diverser Risikofaktoren\nber\u00fccksichtigen, die in Schwellenl\u00e4ndern vorherrschen. Ein anderer Nachteil ist, dass viele\nStudien vergleichsweise veraltete Daten nutzen, was die Analyse der ver\u00e4nderten\nFinanzmarktbedingungen im Gefolge der Asienkrise verhindert. Das vorliegende\nDiskussionspapier versucht diese L\u00fccke zu schlie\u00dfen, indem es sich auf Zufl\u00fcsse von\nDirektinvestitionen in Schwellenl\u00e4nder beschr\u00e4nkt und daf\u00fcr Daten seit Mitte der neunziger\nJahre verwendet. Die Untersuchung analysiert die Faktoren, die f\u00fcr die Standort-\nentscheidungen deutscher Banken in ausgew\u00e4hlten Schwellenl\u00e4ndern in Mittel- und\nOsteuropa, Lateinamerika und Asien entscheidend waren. Das Schwergewicht liegt dabei auf\nder \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung von L\u00e4nder- und Finanzsektorrisiken in Verbindung mit anderen\nCharakteristika der Gastl\u00e4nder und dem Grad der Verflechtungen zwischen Banken und ihren\ndort ans\u00e4ssigen Firmenkunden. Als Innovation in diesem Zweig der FDI-Forschung wird eine\nder Literatur zu Fr\u00fchwarnindikatoren entliehene Variable, die die Unterlegung von\nkurzfristigen Bankverbindlichkeiten durch W\u00e4hrungsreserven misst, in die \u00f6konometrische\n\u00dcberpr\u00fcfung einbezogen.\nDie Sch\u00e4tzergebnisse best\u00e4tigen nachdr\u00fccklich die verheerende Wirkung von schwelenden\nBankenkrisen. In fast allen Regressionen zeigt die Bankenkrisenvariable eine hochsignifikant\nnegative Korrelation mit der abh\u00e4ngigen Variablen ,,Direktinvestitionsstrom in Relation zum\nBruttoinlandsprodukt des Gastlandes\". Andere exogene Variable, die eine starke Anziehungs-\nwirkung auf FDI entfalten, sind, wie erwartet, Agglomerationseffekte im Sinne deutscher\nNichtbanken-FDI und das als Verh\u00e4ltnis von Aktienmarktkapitalisierung zu Bruttoinlands-\nprodukt gemessene Niveau der Finanzmarktentwicklung. Hingegen spielen das Pro-Kopf-\nEinkommen, das allgemeine L\u00e4nderrisiko und der Offenheitsgrad des ausl\u00e4ndischen\nFinanzsektors eine geringere Rolle. Dass Ertragserw\u00e4gungen \u00fcberhaupt einen Einfluss haben,\nist nicht nachzuweisen. Die Signifikanz der die Handelsverflechtung abbildenden Variablen\nist letztlich nicht robust.\nDie Disaggregation der Stichprobe nach Regionen veranschaulicht, dass die Einflussfaktoren\nzwischen den Kontinenten differieren. W\u00e4hrend f\u00fcr die kleine Stichprobe der europ\u00e4ischen\nL\u00e4nder neben dem Ausbleiben von Bankenkrisen das Wirtschaftswachstum der entscheidende\nFaktor ist, zog es deutsche Banken in Lateinamerika in L\u00e4nder mit Finanzzentren, und die\nGastl\u00e4nder Asiens wurden entsprechend des Zustroms an Direktinvestitionskapital deutscher\nNichtbanken ausgew\u00e4hlt. Ein Vergleich der Zeitabschnitte vor und nach der Asienkrise zeigt,\ndass beide L\u00e4nderrisikovariablen in der Nachkrisenstichprobe an Signifikanz gewonnen\nhaben. Dies gilt im besonderen Ma\u00dfe f\u00fcr die Sensibilit\u00e4t gegen\u00fcber Bankenkrisen. Dieses\nErgebnis deutet darauf hin, dass die deutschen Banken aus der Asienkrise gelernt haben und\nihre Positionen anpassten, wenn die Funktionsf\u00e4higkeit des ausl\u00e4ndischen Finanzsystems\nzunehmend als gef\u00e4hrdet erschien, oder riskante Bankenm\u00e4rkte ganz und gar mieden.\nDie zentrale Schlussfolgerung dieser Untersuchung ist, dass zus\u00e4tzlich zu traditionellen\nmakro\u00f6konomischen Variablen auch Messgr\u00f6\u00dfen des L\u00e4nderrisikos und speziell des\nFinanzsektorrisikos, die die Variabilit\u00e4t der erwarteten Ertr\u00e4ge beeinflussen, bei der\nEinsch\u00e4tzung der die Bankenansiedlung im Ausland beeinflussenden Bestimmungsgr\u00fcnde in\nBetracht gezogen werden sollten.\nContents\n2 Models of Foreign Banking Activity 2\n3 Review of the Literature and Hypothesized Variables 6\nForeign Bank Entry into Emerging Economies:\nAn Empirical Assessment of the Determinants and Risks Predicated\non German FDI Data\n1 Introduction\nOver the past decade, a large number of countries, especially those in emerging markets,\nopted to open their banking sectors to foreign equity participation. Since the onset of this type\nof financial liberalization, foreign direct investment of banks domiciled in industrialized\ncountries has grown strongly, attracting the attention of researchers. Studies on the locational\nchoices of multinational banks have gradually proliferated in the empirical literature. There is\nnow an established body of evidence on commonly agreed determinants of banking FDI.\nThese investigations highlight the role of market integration, causing banks to establish\nforeign subsidiaries when their customers go international (via trade or direct investment), as\nwell as of locational factors abroad such as financial sector development or the lack of\ncompetition tantamount to large banking margins.\nSeveral studies, most prominently perhaps the one by Focarelli and Pozzolo (2001), have used\nmicroeconometric methods to explore which banks expand abroad and have found that the\nsize of banks, their efficiency, and restrictions on banking at home are generally decisive\nfactors.1 In forthcoming papers, Buch and Lipponer (2004a, 2004b) furnish micro-level, i.e.\nbank-specific evidence that bank size, profitability and the degree of internationalization are\nunquestionably positively correlated with the decision to enter foreign banking markets. Even\nso, most studies analyze FDI by banks between developed economies and thus do not\nconsider the distinctive framework concerning various risk factors which is prevalent in\nemerging markets. Another common limitation is that many studies use relatively dated time\nseries which inhibits analysis of the changed financial market conditions in the aftermath of\nthe Asian crisis.\nThis paper aims at closing this gap in the empirical literature by investigating the factors\ncrucial to the locational decisions of multinational German banks in selected emerging\nmarkets between 1994 and 2001. Specifically, emphasis is placed on testing variables of\nmacroeconomic and financial sector risk. The latter is measured by a crisis variable taken\nfrom the literature on \"early warning indicators\", which, as it turns out, strongly impacts FDI\nby banks. As a dependent variable, quasi-flows derived from differences in adjusted FDI\nstocks are used. Aggregate German banking FDI flows to the 20 countries in the sample\nquintupled during the sample period. This verdict also holds for global FDI flows into\nemerging banking markets. As Galindo et al. (2002) illustrate, foreign control of local banks\nin Latin America more than quadrupled throughout the sample period, with the most extreme\ncase being Mexico whose foreign control rate went up from almost zero in 1994 to nearly\n80% in 2001. By the end of the sample period, eastern European banking markets were also\nunder majority control by foreign institutions (see Table 6, Appendix). In Asia, even though\nFDI inflows were among the largest world-wide, foreign control of local banks was virtually\nnon-existent at the time, which suggests that governments in emerging Asia were keen on opening\nup to foreign investment capital while retaining control over domestic banks by allowing minority\nstakes only.\nThe paper is structured as follows: The next section discusses the theoretical framework for\nselecting explanatory variables which reflects the risk-return tradeoff an individual bank faces\nwhen maximizing its utility within a two-country portfolio choice model. Section three\nprovides a review of the literature on FDI in banking. The quantitative approach is laid out in\nsection four along with stylized facts on the time-varying distribution of FDI stock of German\nbanks across the sample countries. Next, in section five, the set of variables previously\nderived in the theoretical part is subjected to econometric testing, first for the whole sample\nand then broken down by region and time period. The study closes with a brief appraisal of\nthe empirical results.\n2 Models of Foreign Banking Activity\nWithin the literature on FDI of financial services companies, models of banking investments\nare clearly dominant. While it is possible, in principle, to extend such models to the direct\ninvestments of insurance firms, it has to be kept in mind that certain determinants, such as the\ninterest rate spread between loans and deposits, only apply to banking institutions. Most\nstudies take an ad-hoc approach to estimating determinants of FDI. However, even the few\nrelatively straightforward, recurring on the optimization of shares of portfolio investments.\nCombining the aforementioned approaches and tolerably simplifying them, banks' utility is\ndependent on expected returns (Re) and the variability of returns (2\nR\n), such that:2\n),\n,\n(\n\n\n>\n\n\n=\nR\ne\nR\ne\nB\nU\nand\nR\nU\nwhere\nR\nU\nU\n\n .\nIn a two-country setting, expected (net) returns are calculated as the sum of interest earned on\ndomestic and foreign loans net of interest costs on domestic and foreign deposits, whereas\nforeign positions are also subject to changes in the exchange rates:\n*\nD\nD\nF\n*\n*\nL\nL\ne)D\n(r\nD\nr\nR\nr\ne)L\n(r\nL\nr\n]\ne\nE[R -\n-\n-\n+\n+\n+\n= ,\nwith r\nL\n(r*\nL\n) and r\nD\n(r*\nD\n) being the expected interest rates on domestic (foreign) loans L (L*)\nand corresponding deposits D (D*), respectively, e the expected change in the bilateral\nnominal exchange rate and r\nF\nthe interest rate to be earned on a risk-free asset R. Variable\nadministrative costs and the bank's initial wealth are dispensed with in this context.\nThe variance of expected returns for portfolio shares xi\nis defined as:3\n!\n*\n*\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n=\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n=\n+\n= \u00e5\n\u00e5 \u00e5 \u00e5\n= =\n\n=\ni\nm m\nn\nm\nn\nmn\nn\nm\nn\nm\nm\nm\nR\nx\nand\nD\nL\nD\nL\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nwhere\nx\nx\nx \n\n\n\n\nwith  and , as usual, denoting the standard deviation of and the correlation coefficient\nbetween portfolio shares, respectively.\nMaximizing the bank's utility subject to the restriction that total loans must not exceed\navailable deposits, while noting that the volatility of returns from abroad also hinges on\nexchange rate fluctuations, the bank's optimal portfolio is determined as follows:4\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\ni\ne\ne\ni\ni\ne\ne\ni\ni\ni\nx\nR\nR\nU\nx\nR\nE\nR\nE\nU\nx\nU \n\nSolving for xi\n, the optimal portfolio shares turn out to be a function of expected excess returns\non loans and deposits (e.g. excess return on loans = r\nL\n\u00adr\nF\n), both at home and abroad, and on\nthe degree of risk aversion of the individual bank.\nThis model, however, neglects the specific framework in which foreign direct investment is\ncarried out. It fails to account for costs incurred by entering (or potentially exiting) the\nmarket, which, as Galindo et al. (2002) show for Latin America, vary substantially across\njurisdictions and do influence foreign banking activity.5 Nor does the analysis involve the real\noption value of postponing FDI in favor of continuing to lend to the foreign market. As to the\nlatter factor, a stylized partial equilibrium model exploring the inter-linkages between policy\nuncertainty, real option value and the timing of FDI at the firm level was recently put forth by\nChen and Funke (2003). As a caveat, the authors point out that their microeconomic model\ncannot be mechanically translated to aggregate investment, as it does not capture the strategic\n5 The authors report that in the empirical analysis differences in the legal setup of host countries reduce bilateral\n(foreign) participation in the banking system abroad by at least 13%, see Galindo et al. (2002), pp. 13-15.\ninteraction among firms in the sense of early movers prompting similar investment by\ncompetitors which would otherwise have chosen to wait it out.6 Bland\u00f3n (1998) aims at\nassessing the importance of timing for direct investment. In a study on FDI in Spain, he shows\nthat it is the banks with the strongest comparative advantages (size, international experience)\nthat enter a new banking market first, lending support to the theory of ownership-specific\nadvantages as an explanation for firms' expanding abroad (see section 3.2.1 below).\nReturning to the portfolio choice approach, a distinct drawback concerning the empirical\ntesting of the above model is, typically, the scarce availability of information on the expected\nrate of returns. This holds true even more for emerging markets, where economic conditions\ntend to vary greatly. Therefore, appropriate proxies for expected returns need to be derived. In\ngeneral, it is possible to think of a variety of variables influencing the rate of return. Some are\nmore direct than others, such as the prevailing interest rate spread or real interest rates as well\nas the degree of competition in the banking market determining whether monopoly rents may\nbe reaped by prospective entrants. Among the variables which have a relatively indirect\ninfluence on banks' profitability abroad are those relating to specific beneficial characteristics\nof a certain location or to the ability of a given bank to capitalize on distinct ownership\nadvantages.\nThus, a linear relationship between expected return and an array of proxy variables for such\nfactors may be hypothesized:7\n= =\n+\n+\n+\n=\nJ\nj\nK\nk\nt\ni\nt\ni\nk\nt\ni\nj\nt\ni\ne\nt\ni\nR\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, \n\n\n P\nI ,\nwith I and P denoting vectors of proxy variables for the degree of banks' internalization of\ncomparative advantages and their profitability (in country i and year t), respectively. The\nvector I can be thought of as representing the ability to provide specific services j to home\ncountry clients that local banks abroad could not (see section 3.2.1), while P is deemed to\ndepict characteristics (i.e. opportunities, challenges) of local banking markets k.\nHowever, the above model addresses the issue of risk only indirectly, hiding it in the assumed\nvariability of the proxy variables. The degree of risk is an important determinant of whether to\nenter an emerging market at all and if so, which foreign location to choose. In expanding to\ndeveloping countries banks expose themselves to risks not present in their domestic markets.8\nIf a certain bank relies heavily on income from unstable foreign locations, both borrowers,\nowing to possible non-renewal of loans, and creditors worried about the safety of deposits\nmay reconsider their relationship with the bank.\nBe that as it may, it is the question of whether country risk or financial vulnerability matters\nfor German banks that is at the heart of the present study. To isolate country-specific factors\nthat have a more or less immediate influence on variability of banks' foreign earnings, a set of\nrisk variables is explicitly included in the estimations.\nThus, the fundamental regression equation for FDI flows of the banking sector has the\nfollowing form:\ni\nt\ni\nl\nL\nl\nl\nK\nk\nt\ni\nk\nk\nJ\nj\nt\ni\nj\nj\nt\ni\nt\ni\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, \n\n\n\n +\n+\n+\n+\n= \u00e5\n\u00e5\n\u00e5\n=\n=\n=\nRISK\nMARKET\nwith\nFOLLOW comprising a vector of up to J variables that are aimed at capturing home country\nbanks' linkages to the rest of the economy's international operations as a proxy for the degree\nof internalization of comparative advantages:\n\u00ad FDINONBK (lagged FDI outflows of the non-financial sectors relative to GDP),\n\u00ad TRADE (lagged total trade with a given host country relative to its GDP),\nMARKET containing up to K measures of banking market attractiveness in the host country:\n\u00ad GDPCAP (real GDP per capita),\n\u00ad FINCTR (ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP as proxy for financial centers),\n\u00ad REALINT, MARGIN (real interest rate, i.e. lending rate minus inflation; and banking margin,\ni.e. lending minus deposit rates adjusted for exchange rate changes, respectively; both\nvariables serve as proxies for potential profitability and the degree of competition),\n\u00ad BANKFREE, OPENNESS (freedom from restrictions on banking activity, and on both\nopenness to banking and investment flows, respectively), and the\nRISK vector pertaining to as much as L variables of macroeconomic and institutional\nuncertainties facing foreign investors that are depicted by\n\u00ad CRISK (country risk) and, as a sub-component, PRISK (political risk),\n\u00ad M2/RES (ratio of M2 to gross international reserves as proxy for incipient banking crises),\n\u00ad RERVOL (volatility of the real exchange rate).\nThe descriptions and sources of the variables employed in this study are detailed in the\nappendix (Table 7).\n3 Review of the Literature and Hypothesized Variables\n3.1 Endogenous Variable\nOf the 17 empirical studies on foreign banking activity reviewed here, less than half actually\nconsider outright foreign direct investment by banks (Sagari (1992), Buch and Lapp (1998),\nentry at the firm level by employing correlation analysis or probit estimation (Cardone-\nRiportella et al. (2000), Focarelli and Pozzolo (2001)). The remaining studies use as a\ndependent variable total assets of banks' foreign subsidiaries (Nigh et al. (1986), Sabi (1988),\nGalindo et al. (2002)), the number of offices abroad (Goldberg and Johnson (1990), Brealey\nof \"FDI initiatives\"), foreign banks' share in the host market (Claessens et al. (1998)) or\nsubsidiaries' total lending (Seth et al. (1998)). In a sense, the use of total banking assets is the\nmost comprehensive measure of foreign banking activity, and FDI represents \u00ad from a purely\naccounting perspective \u00ad merely a subset of total capital. Still, each concept depicts\nreasonably well the degree of cross-border funds supplied by parent companies which are\npredominately located in industrial countries.\nThe endogenous variable used in this study is the year-on-year difference in FDI stocks\n(direct and indirect holdings) of the German banking sector10 adjusted11 for deviating\nreporting dates, actual participation rates for indirect participating interests as well as\nrepatriated profits, relative to host-country GDP. This normalized variable has the merit of\nautomatically deflating the time series and accounting for exchange rate effects while at the\nsame time largely eliminating unwarranted non-stationarity in the data. It would have been\ndesirable to relate the FDI flow to the size of the banking sector in the host country but, as it\nturns out, the national accounts of several countries in the sample include the real estate\nindustry or personal services in the financial sector without detailing the sub-components.\nWhile this limitation could, in principle, be tolerated, the fact that the Russian statistics, as\nprovided by the IMF, include unrelated activities, inter alia subsoil resources and exploration,\nin financial services prohibits using the size of the financial sector as a normalization variable.\n9 The study by Moshirian (2001) uses merely balance-of-payments data when defining German FDI. This is\nmethodically questionable as doing so fails to account for indirect participating interests (i.e. those via a holding\ncompany, possibly located in a country other than the host country to be examined). Then again, other studies do\nnot bother to explain the derivation of FDI stocks or flows at all.\n10 The definition used here includes asset management corporations, leasing companies, mutual funds and\nholding companies making direct investments.\n11 For a detailed description of the definition of FDI and of the various adjustment procedures, see the author's\nrecent paper (Wezel (2003), section 2.1). In the present study, no correction for balance-sheet depreciation was\ncarried out because the share of fixed assets in banks' balance-sheets is traditionally low in comparison to the\nmanufacturing sector.\n3.2 Exogenous Variables\n3.2.1 \"Follow the Client\" Motive\nAs banking is an information-intensive industry, foreign banks can differentiate themselves\nfrom their counterparts in the host country by offering complex and specialized services to\ntheir home country corporate customers. The ability to custom-tailor these services \u00ad\nfinancing, information brokerage and transaction banking \u00ad is frequently rooted in a\nlongstanding relationship with the client. Over the years, banks gain proprietary information\nabout their clients' particular financial needs, the knowledge of which is \u00ad at least initially \u00ad\nunavailable to host country institutions. The flow of information enables the bank to assess\nloan renewals at low marginal cost because of earlier assessment work. This lower marginal\ncost translates into a competitive advantage over incumbent local banks. As informational\nasymmetries mean that the value of this type of information is difficult to price by potential\nbuyers (i.e. other banks), market failure arises: The internal information cannot be traded on\nmarkets and therefore needs to be exploited by the institutions possessing it. In the literature\n(Grubel (1977)), this rationale has been termed \"defensive expansion\". To prevent\nmultinational corporations from soliciting these local or other foreign competitors, banks are\nimpelled to follow the client by opening an office (branch, subsidiary) abroad themselves in\norder to defend their unique bank-client relationship.12\nAlso, foreign banks tend to provide easier access to hard currency or international credit and\nare frequently perceived as more secure than local banks. This exploitation of ownership-\nspecific advantages13 in terms of differentiated products, advanced technology or superior\nhuman skills constitutes a distinct intangible asset.14 Once again, these factors are not readily\ntradable and are more difficult to emulate than relatively standardized, less information-\nintensive products, thereby endowing foreign banks with a longer term competitive edge over\ncompetitors.15 Note that foreign bank entry occurs despite the possibility to serve the client\nfrom the headquarters or via correspondent banks because by having a presence abroad, the\n13 There is a controversy in the literature (see overview by Williams (1997), pp. 82-84) between proponents of\nDunning's (1977) eclectic theory, which stresses the necessity for firms to have monopolistic advantages\n(concerning ownership, location, internalization) in order to imperil local incumbents' position, and adherents of\nthe Coasian view, which explains the existence of firms by pointing to transaction costs causing firms to prefer\nownership of assets rather than incurring costs of contracting in the market. The former theory is firmly\ngrounded on ownership characteristics (generation of assets) which are subsequently internalized (asset use),\nwhile the latter emphasizes cost advantages (or rather, the trade-off between in total costs and total benefits) of\ninternalizing operations. Put differently, the difference in opinion is rooted in the question of whether market\nfailure is caused by incomplete markets or excessive transaction costs. In reality, the distinctions between both\nparadigms may be smaller than hypothesized by both camps, especially when markets for information-intensive\nassets are underdeveloped to begin with as is likely to be the case with emerging markets.\nbank can react faster and more efficiently to whatever needs the client may have in a given\nsituation abroad.\nIn the literature, virtually every study incorporates as explanatory variables outward FDI of\nthe non-financial sector and/or the degree of trade linkages between the home and host\neconomies.\n(a) FDI of the Non-Financial Sector\nAll but two of the studies reviewed account for FDI outflows of the non-financial sector (in\nsome cases, manufacturing FDI or total outward FDI), either in flows or stocks, depending on\nthe characteristics of the endogenous variable. Most studies indeed find a strongly positive\nrelationship between non-financial FDI and the corresponding stakes of the banking sector.\nand Kaplanis (1996) stand out because they put data on German outflows to the test. While\nthe first three papers find a positive link, the last-named study reports an insignificant\ncoefficient for (total) outward German FDI to both industrialized and developing countries.\nAs a caveat, it should be mentioned that Brealey and Kaplanis use as a dependent variable\nsimply the number of foreign bank offices, and that the regression is a cross-section for 1992\nand can therefore only be considered a snapshot view. Fittingly, Miller and Parkhe (1998)\noffer panel evidence on the link between foreign banking assets/offices and total U.S. FDI in\ndeveloping countries only: while for total banking assets the coefficient is insignificant, the\nresults for foreign branches and subsidiaries turn out to be highly positively significant.\nMost prominently perhaps, the study by Seth et al. (1998) is exclusively devoted to\ninvestigating the relationship between lending of foreign banks in the U.S. and the financing\npatterns of fellow non-financial firms operating there. It is hypothesized that if there is to be a\n\"follow-the-client\" behavior, the foreign subsidiaries should mainly be serving their home-\ncountry clients' financing needs and not engage in lending to other, presumably American,\ncustomers. The authors are able to refute the hypothesis for banking subsidiaries from all G7-\ncountries save German institutions. Showing that bank borrowing by US affiliates of German\nmultinationals exceeded total lending by German banks' subsidiaries in all sample years\n(1981-1992), the authors are led to conclude that this is \"the only group of banks for which\nwe can say it is possible that they exclusively followed home-country customers\".16\nConflicting evidence is presented by Moshirian and Van der Laan (1998): U.S., U.K. and\nGerman FDI of the non-banking sector is each shown to be negatively correlated to foreign\nassets of banks from the respective country. However, this finding does not entirely contradict\nthe other results as it may well be that the assets of foreign subsidiaries (or other more-than-\n16 Seth et al. (1998), p. 14. This effect, of course, is shown to apply to a highly developed banking sector and\nmay not be present in emerging markets.\n10% interests), being merely a subset of total (consolidated) assets, move in line with non-\nfinancial FDI. Actually, Moshirian, in a later study (2001), now finds a positive sign for\nGerman non-banking FDI when relating it to total FDI in banking as a dependent variable.\nConsequently, a positive sign of the non-financial FDI variable, FDINONBK, is expected for\nthe present study. The variable is lagged by one period to account for banks' reaction time in\nfollowing the clients abroad and also to forestall simultaneity bias.\n(b) Trade Linkages\nAnalogous to the relationship between banking and non-banking FDI, trade links are deemed\nto propel foreign bank entry.17 It has been argued that without the physical presence of banks\nshepherding trade operations of domestic exporters abroad, most trade transactions would\nappear to become rather difficult or not viable at all.18\nEmpirical evidence generally supports the theoretical notion that strong trade links will foster\nbanking FDI in the destination country. This holds true for banks from Germany (studies by\nBuch (2000) as well as Moshirian), the U.S. (Goldberg and Johnson, Moshirian), the U.K.\n(Moshirian), Japan (Yamori), Spain and Finland (Cardone-Riportella et al.), and for all of the\nOECD countries (Focarelli and Pozzolo) investing abroad. FDI inflows to transition countries\nare shown by Papi and Revoltella (2000) to be driven by strong trade links as well.\nConversely, Miller and Parkhe (1998) find an insignificant or even negative sign for U.S.\nbilateral trade with developing countries when relating it to banks' total assets or number of\noffices, respectively. In light of the overall evidence, a positive coefficient is hypothesized for\nTRADE, the variable measuring total bilateral German trade (also lagged) with the sample\ncountries.\n(a) Host Country Income\nIdeally, the size of the host country's banking market, measured by sectoral GDP or loan\nvolume, should feed into the investing bank's utility function because a larger market offers\nthe potential for exploiting economies of scale and thus for decreasing marginal costs of\nproduction.19 Since, in the present study, FDI flows have already been adjusted for market\n17 Interestingly enough, an alternative measure for capturing trade relations is geographical distance, as trade\ntends to be strongest with neighboring countries. In the study of Papi and Revoltella (2000), distance is found to\nbe insignificant for FDI inflows to transition countries, either because of little between-group variation within\nthe sample or because total trade is simultaneously accounted for in their regressions. As an alternative measure\nBland\u00f3n (1998) suggests cultural proximity, notably a dummy variable for countries of FDI origin that belong to\nthe \"same cultural group\" as the host country, Spain. Blandon's regression shows similarity in culture to foster\nFDI inflows into the Spanish banking sector.\nsize by relating them to host country GDP, adding an exogenous size variable would make\nlittle sense, even less so considering the fact that, as mentioned above, the definition of the\nfinancial services sector is far from consistent across countries. In order to still account for the\nhost countries' purchasing power and thus demand for banking services, real GDP per capita\nis included in the regressions. This measure aims at capturing between-group effects in terms\nof diverging national income levels as well as within-group growth effects by having those\nlevels vary throughout the sample period.\nMost studies reviewed here incorporate a certain type of income variable, be it real absolute\nGDP (Brealey and Kaplanis, Moshirian and Van der Laan) or GDP per capita (Buch and\nLapp, Buch (2000), Claessens et al., Papi and Revoltella, Sagari, Yamori) and largely find a\nstrongly positive relation to FDI or foreign banking assets. The only exceptions to this finding\nare the studies by Nigh et al. (variable: manufacturing production), and Sagari, which report\ninsignificant regression outcomes, and by Goldberg and Johnson, who, remarkably, find\nnegative coefficients for per capita income when measuring the determinants of US banking\nactivity abroad (assets/number of foreign branches, from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s).\nGiven the empirical evidence, in this study a positive sign for the income variable GDPCAP\n(in logs) is expected.\n(b) International Financial Centers\nThe aspect of market size may still be captured by trying to determine whether a given\nbanking market sector fulfills certain characteristics of a typical international financial center\nthat would almost automatically attract foreign banks. The issue as to what exactly constitutes\na financial center is tackled by authors in quite ways. Methods range from not detailing the\nmethodology at all (Cardone-Riportella et al.) or simply, yet correctly, stating that certain\nlocalities (Hong Kong, Singapore and the like) are such centers (Buch and Lapp) to using\neither an adequate proxy variable (Focarelli and Pozzolo: ratio of stock market capitalization\nto GDP) or econometric modeling (Brealey and Kaplanis: regressing the \"abnormal\" number\nof banks on measures of capital market activity; their results for financial centers are also used\nNot surprisingly in light of the diverging approaches, the empirical evidence on financial\ncenters is mixed. Cardone-Riportella et al. (2000) report a strongly positive coefficient for\nSpanish banks expanding abroad, whereas they fail to find such an effect in the corresponding\ncase of Finnish banks. Focarelli and Pozzolo (2001) argue that the negative signs they report\nresiduals from a previous regression of banks' foreign presence on exports to the host country and its GDP, the\nauthors regress these residuals on two measures of capital market activity (syndicated loans, value of eurobonds)\nand find that these measures alone are able to explain between 37% and 49% of the variation in the \"abnormal\"\nnumber of banks domiciled in foreign countries.\nfor the market capitalization variable are due to an apparent saturation of financial markets,\nmaking it unattractive to expand abroad. Arguably the most relevant are the results presented\nby Buch and Lapp (1998), and Buch (2000), since the authors analyze data on German\nbanking FDI: Their findings from a pooled time-series regression for FDI outflows to\nrespectively, suggest a strong pull effect exercised by financial centers in the sample.\nIn the present study, the ratio of market capitalization of listed companies relative to GDP of\nthe host economy, FINCTR, is used to capture the incidence of financial centers. This discrete\nvariable was preferred to the dummy variable approach as it exhibits considerable variation\nover time and thus is more appropriate in a panel setting.\n(c) Banking Margin / Competition\nReturning to the theoretical analysis in section 2, various measures for banking market\nattractiveness or the level of competition have been suggested in the literature. Among these\nis an elaborate approach by Moshirian and Van der Laan (1998) to measuring the interest-rate\ndifferential of lending rates between markets at home and abroad. Problematically, their\ncalculation is based on both expected inflation and exchange rates, and consequently requires\neconometric estimation of forward rates as proxies for these future rates. The authors find that\na negative differential (i.e. higher rates abroad than at home) is positively correlated with\nforeign assets of, inter alia, German banks. In a later study, Moshirian (2001) uses a cost of\ncapital differential of German banks vis-\u00e0-vis host countries, represented by the \"required\"\nafter-tax interest rate spread (lending minus deposit rates, adjusted for corporate tax rates).\nHis empirical findings suggest that a lower cost of capital structure at home than abroad\ncontributes to German banking FDI. In a similar vein, Bland\u00f3n (1998) regards the interest\nmargin not only as a measure of market attractiveness but first and foremost as an indicator of\nthe degree of banking competitiveness (the variable in question is insignificant, however).\nOther studies simply focus on the signaling effect of high interest margins in terms of profit\nopportunities. Papi and Revoltella (2000), in a study of banking FDI inflows to transition\ncountries, report a positive coefficient for the spread on bank interest rates. Yamori (1998) as\nwell as Claessens et al. (1998) consider the definition of the real-interest-rate variable used in\nthe present study, REALINT, namely lending rates adjusted for inflation rates abroad. The\nintuition behind this choice is that, in the absence of capital controls, banks freely decide\nwhether to fund the operations from home or abroad. They can be expected to choose the\nminimum of interbank rates at home (e.g. LIBOR) and foreign deposit (interbank) rates\n(adjusted for expected inflation or, if solely calculating in home currency, expected exchange\nrate changes). The outcome of this choice is very difficult to track consistently. It seems\ntherefore justified to concentrate on the deflated lending rates abroad as a measure of both\nprofit opportunities and (lack of) competition in the foreign banking sectors. Nevertheless, to\ncheck for validity, an alternative profitability variable, MARGIN, is computed:\n( ) ( )\n( ) \u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n+\n+\n-\n+\n=\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\nd\nl\nMARGIN\n,\n,\n,\nwhere l and d denote average lending and deposit rates (per cent), respectively, and NER is\nthe change in the year-end exchange rate (with NER>0 representing a depreciation of the\nhost country's currency against the Deutsche Mark). The assumption underlying the additional\nadjustment for exchange rate movements is that the banking spread may not fully incorporate\nexcessive inflation (as seems to have been the case with Brazil in the late 1990s). To obtain\nthe rate that is relevant to a German bank, the host country's banking spread needs to be\nadjusted for the loss in value due to depreciation of its currency.\n(d) Openness of the Foreign Banking Market\nHost country banking markets are often oligopolistic in nature, and perfect competition is the\nexception to the rule. These oligopolies are commonly the outcome of barriers to entry which\na foreign multinational bank may be deterred by or, conversely, seek to exploit. In fact, this\nmarket characteristic may be called a double-edged sword because the benefit of operating in\na competition-restricted environment can only be reaped after clearing specific hurdles\nimposed by the government to protect the domestic banking system. Even if a foreign bank is\ngranted entry, it may still suffer from cumbersome regulations or uneven government\ntreatment in which case it will operate at a disadvantage compared with local banks.21 One\nmay assume that the deterring effect of banking restrictions applying to foreign institutions\noutweigh the conceivable opportunities presenting themselves upon entry into such over-\nregulated markets.\nMost studies on banking FDI rely on dummy variables in measuring the extent of government\ninterference with market provision of financial services. Surveying the literature, approaches\nmore elaborate scales (Goldberg and Johnson (1990), Papi and Revoltella (2000), Galindo et\nal. (2002)) to indices composed of several individual criteria (Sabi (1988)) or even a\nregulatory matrix with a total of 15 sub-classifications (Sagari (1992)) of which those\nprincipal components were tested that might theoretically be relevant to U.S. FDI in banking.\nGalindo et al. (2002), testing for the impact of various administrative impediments on foreign\nbanks, demonstrate that the assets of their subsidiaries are negatively related to higher\nregulatory burdens in the host countries and to greater differences in banking regulations\nbetween the two countries. Sagari (1992) puts two components to the test: one is aimed at\nmeasuring discrimination against foreign banking affiliates, and the other one combines\nmeasures of barriers to entry and of operating constraints once inside a country.22 The\noverriding result of these empirical studies is that a high degree of such openness is conducive\nto FDI flows in banking. The only study not to find a significantly positive relationship is the\nFollowing Sagari's approach, this study uses two measures of banking freedom, both taken\nfrom the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom that has been published since\n1994.23 The index's factor #6 (\"banking and finance\") serves as the chief measure of banking\nfreedom, named BANKFREE. It consists of five individual factors: government ownership of\nbanks, restrictions on the ability of foreign banks to open branches and subsidiaries,\ngovernment influence over the allocation of credit, government regulations and freedom to\noffer all types of financial services. The original data have been transformed so that the high\nscore of 4 applies to countries where government involvement in the financial sector is\nnegligible, very few restrictions on foreign banks exist and banks may engage in all types of\nfinancial services (overall: restrictions are \"very low\"). The most negative score applying to\nthe sample countries is 1, denoting heavy government involvement and corresponding\nrestrictions. In order to account more explicitly for barriers to entry as they apply to FDI\nflows, an alternative, more comprehensive openness variable, OPENNESS, was formed. It\nconsists of BANKFREE and, in addition, incorporates Heritage's factor #5 \"capital flows and\nforeign investment\",24 a composite measure of the government's general attitude to foreign\ninvestment. For simplicity and admittedly arbitrarily, equal weights were imposed. Both\nvariables are expected to exhibit a positive coefficient.\nUltimately, the risk of banks' international operations may be defined as the variability of\nearnings or, more specifically, the variance of the rate of return on assets or on equity.\nHowever, it would be a daunting task to try to compute an average rate of return in the\naggregate. Hence, there is a need to devise reasonable proxies for macroeconomic and\ninstitutional uncertainty affecting the stability of banking profits. Such an attempt was made\nby Sabi (1988) who, in the absence of profitability data, used as a proxy for variability of\nreturns the (lagged) deviation of national income from its longer-term trend. The author fails\nto find a significant effect of his variable, which at any rate is a relatively crude measure of\n23 The index is published in last quarter of each year, but in the title appears the following year (the \"2003 index\nof economic freedom\" was published in November 2002).\n24 Index factor #5 comprises the following criteria: foreign investment code, restrictions on foreign ownership of\nbusiness, restrictions on the industries and companies open to foreign investors, restrictions and performance\nrequirements on foreign companies, foreign ownership of land, equal treatment under the law for both foreign\nand domestic companies, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, availability of local financing for foreign\ncompanies; see Heritage Foundation (2002), chapter 5.\nrisk facing foreign investors. More elaborate proxies have in fact been devised in the\nliterature, as the following sections show.\n(a) Country/Political Risk\nThe issue of country risk and, in particular, political risk is a distinguishing feature of\ndeveloping countries. Although many of the emerging markets exhibit a remarkably high\ndegree of macroeconomic stability, there is still a higher likelihood of unexpected economic\ndownturns than in advanced economies. Oftentimes, this has to do with political instability or\ninstitutional deficiencies, for instance in the domestic banking system (see below). The\nmajority of empirical studies neglect country risk indicators as explanatory variables because\nthe samples are usually made up exclusively, or at least predominately, of industrialized\neconomies. Among the few studies to use country risk measures are Papi and Revoltella\n(2000) who find a positive effect for institutional stability of transition countries (as measured\nby stability indicator of Institutional Investor) and Yamori (1998) who uses Euromoney's\ncountry risk index and likewise reports a significantly positive relationship between high\nscores (low country risk) and Japanese banking FDI in 44 countries (of which at least 25 are\nemerging markets).25\nAs this present study is concerned with emerging markets only, the inclusion of a country\n(political) risk variable appears to be warranted. Earlier research on German FDI in\ndeveloping/emerging economies (see Jost and Nunnenkamp (2002) and Wezel (2003)) has\nshown that the Euromoney country risk index selected for the present study performs well in\npartially explaining the German case. The index has the following composition: 25% political\nrisk, 25% economic performance (GNP per capita etc.), 10% debt indicators, 10% debt in\ndefault/rescheduled, 10% credit ratings, 5% access to bank finance, 5% access to short-term\nfinance, 5% access to capital markets, 5% discount on forfeiting. The index's strong emphasis\non debt and access to finance is striking, making a separate debt variable as in some of the\nstudies (Sabi; Moshirian and Van der Laar) unnecessary. The variables are named CRISK and\nPRISK for country risk and its sub-component political risk, respectively.26 Because of very\nhigh correlation, only one of the variables will be tested at a given time. A positive sign is\nexpected in each case.\n25 Remarkably, the country risk variable loses significance when other risk factors such as real interest rates and\nchanges in exchange rates and GNP are accounted for in the same equation; see Yamori (1998), pp. 116-117.\n26 Annual risk scores are derived by summing index scores published by Euromoney in September and March of\nthe following year and then averaging the sum. As a result, economic or political developments that have\nunfolded after the September surveys are also taken into account, albeit with only half the weight of the average\nscore.\n(b) Likelihood of Banking Crises\nThe inclusion of country risk to cover macroeconomic variability may not suffice if other\ntypes of risk can be shown to influence sectoral FDI flows as well. Indeed, banks may be\ndeterred by factors specific to their field of business. As an innovation to the banking FDI\nliterature, this study tests a banking fragility variable (M2 to currency reserves) that has been\nproven reliable in the literature concerned with \"early warning indicators\".27 To be sure, there\nare other indicators of looming banking crises such as output growth, inflation, real interest\nrates, all of which have been widely tested to predict such crises accurately. However, in the\ncontext of this study, many of these factors are already controlled for by GDP per capita, the\nbanking margin or country risk. With respect to a more banking-specific factor, Kaminsky\nand Reinhardt (1999) find the ratio of domestic credit to GDP to be a strong predictor of\nbanking crises, whereas Glick and Hutchinson (1999) report insignificant results for this\nvariable. Apart from being causally related to and thus likely correlated with GDP (growth),28\nstrong credit growth might also signal market attractiveness and therefore be regarded as a\ngood thing. Moreover, it is likely to be correlated with GDP. Consequently, it cannot be\nsingled out as detrimental at all times and may not serve as a unambiguous indicator to\nforeign investors.\nOne factor not yet accounted for is real overvaluation of the currency. Only few empirical\nstudies account for this effect. Most importantly, Moshirian (2001) finds German banking\nFDI to react significantly negatively to real appreciation of host countries' currencies,29\nwhereas Goldberg and Johnson (1990) and Yamori (1998) report insignificant regression\noutcomes. Note that this study does not attempt to meticulously measure harmful\novervaluation directly but instead resorts to an immediate symptom of overvaluation, rapid\ngrowth of banking deposits due to high real interest rates coinciding with loss of currency\nreserves. Therefore, an alternative measure of banking sector fragility is used: short-term\nfinancial liabilities of the banking system (M2) as a share of gross international reserves of\nthe host country, aptly named M2/RES. It is a good crisis predictor \u00ad be it a currency or a\nbanking crisis or both \u00ad because numerator and denominator tend to move in opposite\ndirections when the crisis nears, causing the ratio to display marked deviations from normal in\nsuch a case. Following financial liberalization there are typically strong capital inflows that\ntrigger a lending boom. In the absence of tight banking regulation and supervision, this\nmarket exuberance may not be easily dampened, with real monetary aggregates being\ninelastic to negative macroeconomic developments.30 This could be the result of an active\n29 As measured by the IMF's Multilateral Exchange Rate Model (MERM) index; see Moshirian (2001), p. 326\n(footnote 8).\ncredit expansion policy by the government to offset deposit withdrawal, as was the case in the\nMexican \"tequila\" crisis.31 The loss of currency reserves, on the other hand, is typically\nassociated with the government's (often futile) attempt to defend an exchange rate regime that\nhas gradually become unsustainable. Not only does this \"leaning against the wind\" precipitate\na balance-of-payments crisis, it is also likely to jeopardize the viability of the banking system\nas the foreign currency backing of its short-term (often foreign-currency-indexed) liabilities\ndecreases and the currency is rendered vulnerable to negative and persistent money demand\nshocks.32 Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Detragiache (1998, p. 93) argue that the ratio mainly applies to\ncountries with an exchange rate peg. Nonetheless, intermediate regimes should be considered,\ntoo, because they likewise imply market interventions causing reserves losses. In fact, the\nmajority of sample countries featured a non-floating exchange rate regime during much of the\nsample period in order to retain some discretion in managing the currency's external value.\nIn the empirical literature, the case for M2/RES as a dependable banking crisis predictor may\nbe termed as strong. Kaminsky and Reinhardt (1999), while noting that banking crises are\ntypically triggered by negative developments in the real sector, find the above ratio to be the\nstrongest predictor of banking crises among financial sector variables (75% of crises\n\"called\"), second only to the real interest rate whose significance is likewise a product of\novervaluation. In fact, it also accurately called balance-of-payments crises (81% of cases) as it\ndid in instances of \"twin\" crises. The authors show that the ratio begins to exceed normal\nlevels in tranquil times significantly (by 40-80 %) about six to nine months before the onset of\neither crisis (or both). Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Detragiache (1998) test the ratio of M2 to currency\nreserves as the only consistently significant measure among four financial variables in a panel\nconclusion, showing in a probit regression involving currency crisis indicators that the ratio is\nsignificant at the 1% level specifically for emerging markets.33 Lastly, Eichengreen and Rose\n(1998) report high predictive qualities for real sector variables (world interest rates and\neconomic growth, and overvalued exchange rates are strongest). Defying any value for typical\nbanking crisis variables such as growth of domestic credit, the authors yet contend that among\nthe variables of domestic financial fragility the ratio of M2 to reserves comes closest to being\nsignificant (it actually is at the 20% level).\n31 See Calvo (1996), p. 210. Contrary to the notion of most money demand equations, the Mexican government\nsucceeded in raising real M2 directly via credit expansion: higher transfers to the poor in advance of an election\nstabilized the money demand as the poor are subject to \"cash-in-advance\" effects. This segment of the\npopulation also tends to consume more out of wealth (perceived or actual), thereby propelling economic activity\nand in turn demand for money. Because of the higher activity, firms are then led to keep higher deposits at\nbanks. The above effects joined in halting the autonomous fall in M2 (ibid., p. 212).\n33 Incomprehensibly, the authors do not include this measure in their regression for banking crises, instead using\nonly real sector variables such as inflation and output growth.\n(c) Exchange Rate Volatility\nIn addition, it would be interesting to know whether the volatility of the exchange rate, not\njust overvaluation, matters for banking FDI. For the real economy there is an indication that\nhigh exchange rate volatility may cause firms to establish production sites abroad. This may\nnot be assumed to be stringent for banks.34 Generally speaking, a high degree of exchange\nrate volatility renders forecasting of expected returns subject to greater uncertainty and may\nlead investors to require a higher rate of return in compensation for taking on higher risk. In\nsum, there is reason to be agnostic about the sign of a volatility measure.\nWithin the studies of the banking FDI literature reviewed here, only the one by Buch (2000)\non German FDI in banking (cross sectional regression for 1997) uses an explicit volatility\nmeasure, constructed as the average percentage change of the D-mark exchange rate over five\nyears.35 The author reports a negative sign which is significant at the 10% level. The present\nstudy uses a similar measure, RERVOL, which has been tested meaningful for German FDI in\nAsia (Wezel (2003)). The variable denotes the variance of the indexed real bilateral exchange\nrate (RER) over past years, i.e. regardless of the direction of the individual change,36 and is\naimed at measuring the excess volatility of the RER over and above the exchange rate\nmovements that could reasonably be expected when considering inflation differentials.\n4 Methodology\n4.1 Sample Properties\nAs a selection criterion for the sample countries the study adopts the BIS (Bank for\nInternational Settlements) set of 24 systematically important emerging markets \u00ad Europe:\nCzech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russian Federation, Turkey; Latin America: Argentina,\nBrazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela; Asia: China, Hong Kong SAR, India,\nIndonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Saudi-Arabia, Singapore, Thailand;\n34 It has been demonstrated by Sung and Lapan (2000) that by erecting more than one production facility, i.e.\nopening another plant abroad, and postponing the decision as to where to produce, a multinational\nmanufacturing firm acquires a real option whose value increases with greater exchange rate fluctuations.\nTherefore, it is conjectured that more volatile exchange rates induce the relative value of opening the foreign\nplant to rise. This notion may not hold for banking. Locational decisions can be reversed relatively easily\nbecause there are no production facilities abroad that would translate into sizable sunk costs.\n35 The author does not detail whether the volatility of a bilateral or Germany's effective exchange rate is taken.\n36 The volatility variable is defined as follows:\n\u00e5\n= +\n-\n+\n-\n-\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6 -\n=\n,\n,\n,\n,\nlog\n.\nk k\nt\ni\nk\nt\ni\nk\nt\ni\nt\nRER\nRER\nRERVOL\nwhere RERi,t\nis the real exchange rate between Germany and the ith country in a given year.\nAfrica: South Africa. Of these, three Latin American countries (Colombia, Peru, Venezuela)\nthat did not receive FDI by German banks were omitted as was Taiwan owing to a general\nlack of data from official sources. This brings down the number of sample countries to 20.\nTo ensure a balanced panel of countries, the sample period was chosen to run from 1994 to\n2001 (the most recent data are for 2001 and still preliminary), taking account of the fact that\nsome of the transition countries received their first banking FDI from Germany only in that\nstarting year.37 The timeliness of the data is a distinguishing feature of this study since all\nother studies reviewed here use older data series (up until the mid-1990s).\nFigure 1 illustrates the development of the largest shares of FDI stocks held by German\nbanking institutions over the sample period. The most astounding change is that Poland, once\nbasically starting from scratch, has now captured the top position from Singapore which has\nfallen to third place. Remarkably, Argentina has dropped out of the top ten by end-2001 \u00ad\nthis, incidentally, is before the \"tango\" crisis evolved in early 2002. This constitutes anecdotal\nevidence that German banks shunned Argentina in comparison with to other locations even\nbefore its financial system collapsed. It is also striking that despite the blow Korea took\nduring the Asian crisis, the country managed to raise its share in German banking FDI from\ninto the emerging financial markets of the transition countries despite the fact that a few banks were among the\nfrontrunners. As a reason for this late entry the authors cite difficulties arising from German reunification.\nFigure 1: Top Ten Emerging Market Destinations of German Banking FDI (% of total stocks)\nSingapore\nHong Kong\nHungary\nArgentina\nCzech Rep.\nBrazil\nKorea\nIndia\nMalaysia\nChile\nPoland\nHong Kong\nSingapore\nBrazil\nKorea\nHungary\nCzech Rep.\nRussia\nIndia\nMexico\n4.2 Estimation Technique\nInitially, the familiar panel estimation techniques were applied to the entire sample, i.e. fixed\nand random effects regressions. However, all specification tests on the existence of individual\neffects demonstrate that there are indeed none. Both an F-test on fixed effects (testing the null\nhypothesis that the constant terms are equal) and a Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier test for\nthe random effects model (BP-Test)38 could not be rejected at the 5% level (Prob>F or\nProb>2 were each greater than 0.05 at all times with the exception of regression (17)).\nAs a consequence, pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation was chosen as the\nappropriate estimation technique for the sample,39 with the regression residuals being auto-\nmatically corrected for possible heteroskedasticity and serial correlation within the groups.40\nThis allows correction for very general forms of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation\nwhereas a feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimation procedure would require a\nmore restrictive parametrization of the covariance matrices.41 Notwithstanding these metho-\ndological issues, alternative regressions to the ones contained in Table 1, now using the FGLS\nprocedure, produce broadly similar results (exceptions: the dummy is more significant while\nFDINONBK is less so) as the results in Table 8 in the Appendix reveal. The necessity of\nincluding time dummies was denied as none of the dummies was significant at conventional\nlevels. Regression results display \"standardized\" beta coefficients.42 As a double-log linear\nmodel was not feasible owing to the occurrence of negative FDI flows, this standardization\nallows for comparing the \"weights\" with which the individual variables enter the equation.\n5 Discussion of Results\nThe following sections present the estimation outcome consisting of different model\nspecifications in order to perform a sensitivity analysis. More specifically, the variables\nincluded in each of the three sets derived in section 2 (FOLLOW, MARKET, RISK) are\ntested one at a time to isolate the individual variable's effect on the regression outcome.\nAfterwards, the sample is split up by region and then by time (pre-/post-crisis) to control for\nindividual spatial and temporal effects. Note that for some variables (GDPCAP, FINCTR,\nM2/RES) the logs were taken to bring their originally skewed distributions closer to normality.\n39 As there are no individual effects, the subscript i of  is dropped so that the regression equation becomes:\ni\nt\ni\nl\nL\nl\nl\nK\nk\nt\ni\nk\nk\nJ\nj\nt\ni\nj\nj\nt\nt\ni\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, \n\n\n\n +\n+\n+\n+\n= \u00e5\n\u00e5\n\u00e5\n=\n=\n=\nRISK\nMARKET\nFOLLOW\n40 In STATA, the command for those corrections is \"cluster(...)\", to be used with conventional OLS estimation.\n41 Specifically, a time-constant covariance matrix is assumed for FGLS estimation, and the serial correlation may\nbe represented by a first-order autocorrelated process.\n42 Coefficients are corrected as follows: j\n* = j\n(sxj\n/sy\n) with sxj\nbeing the standard deviation of the jth exogenous\nvariable and sy\nthe standard deviation of the endogenous variable; see Pindyck and Rubinfeld (1981), pp. 90-91.\n5.1 Full Sample Analysis\nThe results of the baseline regression (1) in Table 1, encompassing two variables from each\nset, are somewhat unsatisfactory since half of the variables turn out to be insignificant. Market\nintegration effects pertaining to FDI flows of the non-financial sector clearly dominate the\nscenario, considering the weight of the adjusted coefficient and its t-value.\nTable 1: Follow-the-Leader Effects (all countries)\nPooled OLS estimation, heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors corrected for serial correlation\nDependent variable: FDIGDP; number of observations = 160\nNote: t-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\nThe picture changes considerably if the diverging motives entertained by German banks\nentering European transition countries (here: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russia) are\naccounted for. When including a transition country dummy, DUMMY_CEC, which, as (2)\nshows, is relevant, all variables turn significant (at least at the 10% level) with the expected\nsigns except for the lagged trade variable that exhibits a counterintuitive negative sign.43\nHowever, the trade variable is far from being robust against varying specifications as can be\n43 Note that the regressions below do not represent genuine gravity models as a variable of geographic distance is\nnot included. Using distance instead of the CEC dummy yields broadly similar results due to high correlation.\ntaken from regression (3) where per capita GDP and country risk, both previously only\nslightly significant, are left out. Interestingly, inclusion of trade linkages does not add any\nmeaningful information when already accounting for non-financial FDI or the dissimilarity of\ntransition countries: in both cases, the trade variable's strong significance (t-value: 3.01, when\nFDINONBK and DUMMY_CEC are omitted) completely vanishes. By dropping TRADE as well\nthe parsimonious regression (4) is reached, which illustrates that exactly one variable of each\nset is highly significant for German banking FDI in emerging markets: \"Follow the client\"\neffects are best depicted by non-banking FDI, within market characteristics the variable for\nfinancial centers measured by size-adjusted stock market capitalization stands out, and of the\nrisk variables the backing of short-term deposits by international reserves matters most. In\nturn, this specification represents the baseline model for the following analyses.44 In Table 2,\nvariables from the MARKET cluster are added one at a time to the new baseline case (4).\nTable 2: Market Characteristics (all countries)\nPooled OLS estimation, heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors corrected for serial correlation\nNote: t-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\n44 Regarding the relatively low value of R2, it has to borne in mind that it is composed of \"within\"- and\n\"between\"-group variation. Using a tentative random effects regression, the within-R2, i.e. the variation across\ntime explained by the model, was constantly rather low (around 0.10), while the between-R2 hovered at 0.80.\nThe insignificant coefficients for either interest rate spread variable (REALINT, MARGIN)\nshould not come as a surprise. Conceivably, they are the result of variable misspecification\nbecause of failure to incorporate unknown market expectations that could differ greatly from\nthe actual rates. More revealing are the results for the measures of host country openness to\nbanking (or both banking and FDI). While the specific banking openness variable,\nBANKFREE, is insignificant, the combined variable, OPENNESS, proves to be significant at the\n10%-level. Driving this result is the strong significance (at the 1% level) of the freedom-to-\nFDI component. The results can be interpreted as stipulating that, for German multinationals,\nbanking regulations mattered less than did the absence of general restrictions on capital flows.\nAnalysis of the third variable cluster comprising risk factors in Table 3 reveals that despite the\njoint estimation of M2/RES and CRISK both variables are relevant in (9).\nTable 3: Risk Factors (all countries)\nPooled OLS estimation, heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors corrected for serial correlation\nDependent variable: FDIGDP; number of observations: 160\nNote: t-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\nThe two risk variables seem to depict different aspects of host country instability, given that\nthe bi-variate correlation is surprisingly low (-0.119). Even if M2/RES is lagged by one period\nreflecting the possibility that the country risk rating reacts belatedly to changes in the\ndeposits-reserves ratio, the correlation rises only moderately to -0.292. Nevertheless, CRISK\ngains significance (now reaching the 5% level) when M2/RES is dropped in (10).\nBy contrast, political risk appears to play a less meaningful role as the standard error of its\ncoefficient fails to reach conventional significance levels. The same holds true for volatility of\nthe real exchange rate (RERVOL), which is clearly insignificant. The bottom line of the\nanalysis of risk factors is that the early warning indicator M2/RES is able to explain the\npattern of German banking FDI better than a professional country-risk rating, this being true\nat least for the sample's country composition and time frame.\n5.2 Spatial Disaggregation\nHaving established robust estimators of German FDI activity in banking for the set of\nemerging markets as a whole, the question as to possible dissimilarities within the three\nregions arises. Note that, by omitting Turkey, the European sample is restricted to the\ntransition countries in order not to mingle banking sectors at very different levels of\ndevelopment. This, of course, comes at the cost of losing eight observations. Both the\nEuropean and the Latin American sample thus comprise merely 32 observations. This fact\nshould be borne in mind when interpreting the regression results presented below. The\nestimation outcome in Table 4 offers a number of valuable insights. Each region exhibits its\nvery own determinants for German banking FDI.\nTable 4: Determinants by Region (Baseline)\nPooled OLS estimation, heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors corrected for serial correlation\nDependent variable: FDIGDP; number of observations: Europe = 32, Latin America = 32, Asia = 80\nNote: t-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\nIt is economic growth that matters to banks entering the European transition countries. In\nregression (13) the respective variable, GDPCAP, carries by far the greatest weight in the\nregression and jumps in significance (to a t-value of 5.05) if the highly correlated non-\nfinancial FDI variable is dropped. Furthermore, the crisis variable M2/RES turns out to be\nsignificant at the 5% level and, above all, contributes to the relatively high R-squared by\nexplaining a large fraction of the variation across time. This is most likely the outcome of the\nvariable's signaling the Czech and Russian banking crises of 1997 and 1998, respectively.\n\"Follow the client\" effects do not seem to play a role in the transition countries, thus\nconfirming the hypothesis that this effect mainly applies to more advanced economies (see\nbelow). The insignificant result for FINCTR is quite logical because stock markets were\nvirtually non-existent in the early stages of the transition process. German banks seem to have\ngone abroad despite the lack of well-established financial markets, seeking to be firmly\nestablished when business would take off in the process.\nThe results for the Latin American sample in (14) are by and large immaterial (R-squared\nbelow 0.10), probably due to small sample size and/or model misspecification in that case.\nNeither integration effects nor consequences of country risks can be attested. Notwithstanding\nmethodological issues, the latter finding is a bit surprising, considering the multiplicity of\nfinancial crises in Latin American emerging markets during the sample period. If anything,\nGerman banks were attracted by highly developed financial markets as the strong results for\nFINCTR show. However, the variable is not robust to changes in specification. This is the case\nif, for example, M2/RES is dropped in favor of the country risk variable that is insignificant\nitself.\nIn the Asian banking markets (15), \"follow the client\" effects play a dominant role as\nFDINONBK is equipped with the largest weight and the highest significance. As alluded to\nabove, this integration effect appears to be a characteristic of more advanced economies\nwhere multinationals from the home country are already flocking in large numbers. The\nmarginally significant result for FINCTR is caused by two countervailing effects. If a dummy\nvariable is set for the dominant international financial centers of Singapore and Hong Kong,\nFINCTR turns insignificant (t-value: 1.52) while the dummy itself is significant at the 5%\nlevel. Hence, as could be expected, banks are also subject to agglomeration effects. The\nclustering of international banks in those two locations is incidentally the product of these\ncountries' very liberal attitude to foreign bank entry and capital flows in general. The\ncomprehensive banking/FDI openness variable is not different from zero when added to the\nequation containing the Singapore/Hong Kong dummy. However, if the dummy is left out,\nOPENNESS gains significance, narrowly missing the 10% level (t-value: 1.76). The notion that\nopen borders to FDI flows are instrumental in becoming a financial center is further\nsubstantiated if FINCTR is replaced by the openness variable. As regression (16) illustrates,\nOPENNESS becomes significant at the 1% level in that case. The measures of banking margins\nand exchange rate volatility are both insignificant for Asia as they are for the other two regions.\n5.3 Temporal Disaggregation\nAfter dissecting the sample by region, the other dimension of the panel, namely time, merits\nattention. The sample was divided into two equally-spaced sub-samples. The first one\ncomprises the years 1994-97, which can be considered the \"pre-crisis\" period since the impact\nof the Asian crisis was felt only in late 1997. Accordingly, the other sub-sample is made up of\nthe \"post-crisis\" years 1998-2001. This qualification is warranted because it is possible to\npresume the devastating impact of ignoring early warning indicators already publicly known\nin early 1998. The following table lists the outcome of re-running regression (2), omitting the\ninsignificant trade variable, separately for both sub-samples.\nTable 5: Determinants by Time Period (all countries)\nPooled OLS estimation, heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors corrected for serial correlation\nDependent variable: FDIGDP; number of observations: 80 each\nNote: t-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\nThe regression for the pre-crisis sample in (17) was not estimated by pooled OLS because the\nBreusch-Pagan test of no random effects was rejected at the 5% level. Taking into account the\nhigh value of the F-test (0.99), it is unsurprising that a Hausman-test failed to reject the\nhypothesis that the difference in coefficients between the fixed and the random effects model\nis not systematic. Accordingly, random effects estimation is appropriate in this case.\nThe main difference between the two periods is that, before the Asian crisis, variables of\ncountry riskiness did not significantly influence the rationale of German banks. Their FDI in\nemerging markets was largely driven by market integration aspects as the coefficient for the\nnon-financial FDI illustrates. Also, the dummy variable for the European transition countries\nis also significant at the 5% level, denoting the exceptional role of these economies during\ntheir opening-up to capital flows.\nBy contrast, both variables lose their significance when the post-crisis sample is considered.\nNow, risk aspects rule the picture with the early warning variable, M2/RES, reaching very\nstrong significance (at the 1% level) and the additional country risk variable missing the 10%\nlevel only narrowly. This is clear indication that German banks learned from the Asian\ndebacle, adjusting their holdings more quickly if the soundness of the financial system\ndeteriorates or proportionally disregarding high risk banking environments altogether. In the\nlater years, there is also a greater tendency towards targeting financial centers as locations for\nbanking activity abroad. Lastly, per capita income cannot be shown to exert a meaningful\ninfluence on those locational decisions.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper has investigated whether the significance of determinants commonly found in the\nliterature on foreign direct investment in the banking sector holds for German banks entering\nemerging markets via foreign direct investment. Traditional variables depicting market\nintegration effects represented by FDI of non-banks and as well as financial market\ndevelopment in terms of stock market capitalization did exert the hypothesized influence on\nGerman banking FDI flows. However, in contrast to the evidence presented elsewhere, this\nstudy fails to find a statistically robust impact of bilateral trade linkages on banks' locational\nchoices. Also, per capita income (or growth effects if considering annual differences) did not\nmatter except in a sub-sample comprising European transition countries.\nThe strongest case regarding FDI flows can be made for the necessity of including indicators\nof financial vulnerability. A typical crisis variable measuring the backing of short-term\nbanking deposits by international reserves which was adopted from the literature on \"early\nwarning indicators\" displayed very high levels of significance throughout the empirical\nanalysis. In other words, when a host country's reserves faded as a result of defending an\nunsustainable exchange rate regime, German banks tended to reconsider their direct\ninvestment position, shifting funds out of high-risk countries into more stable environments.\nInterestingly, the traditional measure of country risk (Euromoney index) is also moderately\nsignificant if regressed simultaneously with the crisis variable, indicating that the two\nmeasures depict different aspects of instability. Other non-traditional factors such as the\ndestination market's openness to foreign bank entry, also coupled with a liberal attitude to\ncapital inflows in general, or the volatility of the real bilateral exchange rate did not turn out\nto be meaningful in the German case. The same goes for measures of interest rate margin.\nOpenness to capital flows did matter for banking FDI going into Asia, though, since the\ncombined openness variable was moderately significant.\nThe dissimilarity of the four European transition countries was explicitly incorporated by\nincluding a dummy variable in the full sample regressions. This dummy was moderately\nsignificant throughout, pointing to distinct pull factors such as geographic proximity.\nFurthermore, regressions were run for each regional sub-sample. Since financial markets were\nclearly underdeveloped in central and eastern Europe at the start of the sample period, the\nfinancial center variable, logically, turned out to be irrelevant, while economic growth was the\nfocal point of German banking expansion in that region. Regarding \"follow the client\" effects\ndepicted by the influence of non-financial FDI flows, it is noteworthy that this factor did not\nmatter greatly in the CEC countries while it was the main driving force in the Asian case. This\nsupports the hypothesis that market integration effects matter more for developed banking\nmarkets.\nFinally, when splitting the sample into two four-year periods, roughly before and after the\nAsian crisis, learning effects among German investors become evident. While in the outer\nyears both risk variables, country risk and currency-reserve backing of deposits, were\nvirtually meaningless, they gained significance considerably in the more recent sub-sample,\nwith the financial vulnerability variable even reaching the 1% level. This finding suggests that\nthe experience of the emerging market shake-up in late 1997 has drastically changed the risk\nperception of German banks active in emerging markets. Further empirical evidence on the\nimportance of risk elements in the decision-making process of multinational banks is clearly\nwarranted to affirm this conjecture.\nAppendix\nTable 6: Foreign Bank Ownership in Selected Emerging Markets in 2001\nHost Country Total Assets\n(US$ bill.)\nNumber of\nForeign Banks\nForeign control\nin %\nEurope\nLatin America\nAsia\nNote: Foreign control refers to cases where foreigners own more than 50 % of total equity.\nSource: Inter-American Development Bank (2002), p. 108.
