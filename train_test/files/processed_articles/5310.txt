One social-learning mechanism derived from cultural evolutionary theory is\nprestige bias, which allows a learner in a novel environment to quickly and inexpensively\ngather information as to the potentially best teachers, thus maximizing his or her chances of\nacquiring adaptive behavior. Learners provide deference to high-status individuals in order\nto ingratiate themselves with, and gain extended exposure to, that individual. We examined\nprestige-biased social transmission in a laboratory experiment in which participants\ndesigned arrowheads and attempted to maximize hunting success, measured in caloric\nreturn. Our main findings are that (1) participants preferentially learned from prestigious\nmodels (defined as those models at whom others spent longer times looking), and (2)\nprestige information and success-related information were used to the same degree, even\nthough the former was less useful in this experiment than the latter. We also found that (3)\nparticipants were most likely to use social learning over individual (asocial) learning when\nthey were performing poorly, in line with previous experiments, and (4) prestige\ninformation was not used more often following environmental shifts, contrary to\npredictions. These results support previous discussions of the key role that prestige-biased\ntransmission plays in social learning.\n",

Prestige bias allows a learner in a novel environment\nto quickly and inexpensively choose from whom to learn, thus maximizing his or her\nchances of acquiring adaptive behavioral solutions to a specific task or enterprise without\nhaving to assess directly the adaptiveness of every potential model's behavior. Learners\nprovide deference to teachers in order to ingratiate themselves with a chosen model, thus\ngaining extended exposure to that model (Henrich and Gil-White, 2001). New learners can\nthen use that information--who is paying attention to whom--to increase their likelihood\nof choosing a good teacher.\nConsider a simple example of prestige bias, where a woman has married into a\npatrilocal society and her new community has a different specialization than her home\nlocation. In fact, her new community is one of the few in the world where women rather\nthan men are responsible for making stone arrowheads. A woman in this community can\nenhance her new family's survival prospects by creating arrowheads that not only help her\nhusband kill more game but that can be traded to other communities. As our transplanted\nwoman goes about learning the task of arrowhead making, she has several pathways to\nsuccess. She could engage exclusively in individual (or asocial) learning, where she tries to\nfigure out how to make arrowheads entirely on her own with no social influence\nwhatsoever. Given that projectile-point technology culturally evolved over tens of\nthousands of years through the efforts of countless generations of innovators, each making\nsmall improvements on what went before, her chances of reinventing projectile-point\ntechnology from scratch, using purely individual learning, seem slim.\nAlternatively, our novice flintknapper could engage in some form of biased social\nlearning, where she tries to copy either the object itself, if it is simple, or, more likely, the\nmanner in which others are making their arrowheads (Boyd and Richerson, 1985). In this\nexample, social learning is superior to individual learning because of the high costs of the\nlatter (Boyd and Richerson, 1985). One does not become a flintknapper, let alone an\naccomplished one, overnight (Olausson, 2008; Pigeot, 1990). Instead of trying to reinvent\nthe wheel, it seems more cost effective to buy a ready-made \"package\" off the shelf\nthrough copying, but the question becomes: Which package does she buy? Our learner\ncould \"copy the majority\" (Henrich and Boyd, 1998) and attempt to make arrowheads the\nway most women seem to be doing it, but she doesn't have more than passing access to any\nof those women. Besides, conformity is a time-consuming and cognitively challenging task,\nas the learner would need to survey the whole group to determine the most frequently used\ntechnique (Eriksson, Enquist, and Ghirlanda, 2007).\nA quicker option might be to copy the single most skilled arrowhead makers\n(Henrich and Broesch, 2011; Mesoudi, 2008)--those whose arrowheads kill the most game\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\n(Mesoudi, 2011b; Mesoudi and O'Brien, 2008a). This would be an example of \"success\nbias,\" in this case using information about the hunting success of a model as a guide to\nwhom to copy. Success information, however, might also be difficult to gather under real-\nlife conditions. Hunting success can fluctuate with random variables such as availability of\nprey or weather and can be confounded by other factors such as the motor skills or hand\u00ad\neye coordination of the hunter rather than the quality of the arrowhead. And again, this\nwould require our learner to assess and compare the hunting success of all or most hunters\nin the community to identify the most successful.\nOur novice flintknapper, however, sees another way to gather information quickly.\nThe first thing she noticed when she started making arrowheads was that anytime someone\nhad difficulty with the steps involved, that person always sought out a specific woman in\nthe community for help. Perhaps the master flintknapper was someone older and\npresumably more knowledgeable (Henrich and Gil-White, 2001; Henrich and Henrich,\n2010 [but see Reyes-Garcia et al., 2008]), although our learner could not know this for\nsure, having no direct access to the hunting success of this woman's husband. All she\nknows is that everyone in the community pays this woman more attention and generally\nconfers upon her more respect. From this, our novice decides that she, too, should pay\nspecial attention to this other woman. As such, she is able to learn the intricacies of\nsuccessful arrowhead creation, allowing her husband to kill more game and herself to\nreceive more in trade for her arrowheads.\nThis process might occur not only when a flintknapper enters a new group, but also\nwhenever the environment changes such that a new kind of arrowhead becomes optimal.\nLittle theoretical work has considered the dynamics of prestige-biased transmission directly\nafter an environmental shift, and there are reasons to support both the increased and\ndecreased use of prestige-biased transmission. For example, it may be the case that\nprestigious people continue to be imitated after an environmental shift because their\nreputation comes from something other than the task itself. If, for instance, prestige is\nrelated to some kind of general problem-solving ability or general intelligence (the \"g\"\nfactor), then prestigious individuals will be most likely, and quickest, to discover the new\noptimum after the environmental shift. Even if the optimal strategy is to forego the use of\nprestige-biased transmission directly after an environmental shift, the continued use of this\nbiasing mechanism by underperforming individuals may cause it to persist as a behavioral\nstrategy. We make a first attempt to generate empirical data to address this issue.\nIt is intuitive that prestige bias can be cost effective, but how can we measure it? To\nbegin to answer this question, we can divide prestige bias into four constituent parts: the\nbias to produce information that can be copied by others, the bias to confer deference, the\nbias to value having prestige (on the part of the teacher), and the bias to pay attention to\nprestige information (on the part of the learner). Each part is worth analyzing in detail, but\nhere we report the results of an experiment aimed only at the bias to pay attention to\nprestige information.\nIn the first explicit experimental test of this component of prestige bias, Chudek et\nal. (2012) showed that 3\u00ad4-year-old children preferentially learn from adults at whom other\nadults have spent longer looking. Our study represents the first experimental test of prestige\nbias with adult participants. Further, whereas the task used by Chudek and colleagues--\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nchoosing which of two kinds of food to eat--was relatively simple, we employ a more\ncomplex task that is more representative of actual technology acquired by real-life human\npopulations. Although complex tasks can make the interpretation of results more difficult,\nthese tasks also better reflect the environments in which people actually make decisions\n(Mesoudi and O'Brien, 2008a). As the goal of this paper is to determine whether\nindividuals choose to engage in certain learning strategies, we consider the additional\ncomplication of a multivariate task to be worthwhile. We also, for the first time, present an\nexplicit comparison between prestige bias (where people use cues independent of success,\nsuch as eye-gaze, as a guide to model selection) and success bias (where people use direct\nmeasures of fitness or success, such as hunting yield, as a guide to model selection). If the\nnotion that prestige information serves as an inexpensive proxy for success is correct, then\npeople should prefer to use the more reliable success information when given both success\nand prestige information.\nHypotheses\nThe above discussion leads us to generate the following hypotheses:\n: The amount of time spent looking at an individual will determine the likelihood\nof that individual being chosen as a model by a learner when direct information\nabout an individual's skill is unavailable.\n: The effect of the amount of time spent looking at an individual will increase\nimmediately after an environmental shift.\n: When learners are provided with both the amount of attention paid to potential\nmodels and the direct success of potential models, the effect of H1\n(prestige bias)\nwill decrease and we will see the use of success-biased strategies.\nTask Outline\nTo test these hypotheses, we employed an experimental task used previously to\nIn this task, participants design an arrowhead that may vary in several dimensions (length,\nwidth, thickness, shape, and color), then use their arrowhead to go on a series of \"hunts.\"\nThe closer their design is to hidden optimal designs, the higher their payoff, expressed in\nterms of caloric return. Over successive hunts, participants can improve their design either\nthrough individual learning (trial and error) or through social learning--that is, copying the\ndesign of one or more other participants. Although previous studies (Mesoudi, 2008,\n2011b; Mesoudi and O'Brien, 2008a) have examined success-biased copying--allowing\nparticipants to view the cumulative payoff of other players and then preferentially copy the\nmost successful (highest-scoring) player--here we added the possibility of prestige bias,\nindicated by participants preferentially copying those models whom other participants had\nlooked at for longer periods of time. We initially sought to test this when prestige\ninformation was the only social cue available (to test H1\n); we then introduced periodic\nenvironmental shifts where the hidden optimal arrowhead design changed (to test H2\n); and\nfinally, we introduced direct success information to see whether participants preferentially\nemployed prestige or success bias, if given the choice (to test H3\n).\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nOne hundred thirteen participants took part in the experiment. All were enrolled at\nthe University of Missouri and received course credit for participating in the experiment, in\naddition to monetary payment ranging from $2 to $8 (see below for payment scheme).\nParticipants spent 45\u00ad60 minutes completing the experiment.\nDesign\nAll participants engaged in three seasons of hunting, each of which comprised 30\nhunts. In all three seasons, participants could view prestige information relating to a series\nof models (see next section for details of how prestige was represented) in order to test\nhypothesis H1\n. The environment shifted between each season. Within seasons, season 1\ncomprised a constant environment, whereas seasons 2 and 3 contained a change of\nenvironment in order to test hypothesis H2\n. Season 3 presented success information\nalongside prestige information in order to test hypothesis H3\n. In all seasons, the dependent\nvariable is the model chosen.\nWe can divide social learning into two components: \"observation\" and \"copying.\"\nIn our design, participants could choose to view an arrowhead designed by another person\nbut not actually copy it, i.e., change their arrowhead to match the model's; this would be\nobservation but not copying. Participants who viewed an arrowhead and then copied it\nexhibited both observation and copying (copying cannot occur without observation).\nProcedure / Task\nParticipants were told to imagine they were prehistoric hunters in the American\nGreat Basin and that they needed to design the best arrowhead in order to achieve calories\n(see Figure 1). Three seasons of 30 hunts each were conducted, and after each hunt\nparticipants had the opportunity (1) to modify their arrowhead by learning either\nindividually or socially, or (2) to hunt again with the same arrowhead. Individual learning\ncost 167 calories out of a total of 1000 potential calories (see below). Social learning or\nhunting again with the same arrowhead imposed no caloric reduction. In season 1, the\nadaptive landscape stayed constant throughout the 30 hunts. In both seasons 2 and 3,\nhowever, the adaptive landscape was changed at hunt 15 (see Table 1). Participants were\nwarned before season 1 that this might happen. To encourage participants to perform well, a\naveraged over the three seasons (e.g., a score of 13,000 resulted in no payment, a score of\n15,100 resulted in a payment of $2, and so on). The average payment was $4, with a\nminimum of $2 and a maximum of $8.\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nTable 1.

Prior to beginning, participants were\ninstructed to wait for the other groups to get ready. After 1\u00ad2 minutes, the researcher\ninstructed the participants that the other groups were ready and thus they could begin. To\ngive an air of reality to the deceit, participants were assigned randomly generated wait\ntimes after each hunt (see Appendix 1 for details of wait-time rules). A manipulation check\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nwas conducted at the end of the experiment so that we could exclude from the results those\nparticipants who did not believe in the \"other group\" scenario.1\nBased on pilot data, we imposed a 16.7% cost, corresponding to the \"low cost\"\ncondition of Kameda and Nakanishi (2002), each time a participant learned individually\n(see Table 1). This corresponds to a cost of 167 calories (out of a potential 1000) levied\nagainst a participant's hunting success after each hunt during which the participant learned\nindividually. Kameda and Nakanishi argue that imposing this cost better reflects the reality\nof engaging in risky but potentially rewarding individual learning in a real-world\nenvironment.\nThe manipulation was\nassessed using a simple question after completion of the study: \"Did you believe you were\ninteracting with a group of real people?\" Seventy-three percent of the subjects indicated a\nbelief in the manipulation; the remaining 27% were excluded from all analyses.\nParticipants could change their arrowheads by manipulating any or all of five\nvariables--three continuous (width, length, and thickness) and two discrete (shape and\ncolor), the latter containing four states each. All modifications, except those to color,\nresulted in changes in fitness. After each hunt, participants were given a score ranging from\n1 to 1,000. The values specified for each variable were compared to an underlying function\nspecifying optimal values, which were changed, following the rules below, at the beginning\nof each season and on turn 15 during seasons 1 and 2 (see Appendix 2 for details of fitness\nfunctions).\nOn the first hunt of each season, participants were presented with a choice of five\narrowheads that had been used to hunt on a previous day, along with the hunting \"success\"\nof each arrowhead (see Table 1). We emphasize that the arrowheads are proxies for the\nindividuals who made them, and when we say that a participant \"learned\" from an\narrowhead, we mean that he or she learned from the individual who had created the\narrowhead the participant was copying.\nParticipants were required to select one of the five arrowheads as their starting\npoint. The characteristics of these arrowhead models were generated through simulation\nusing agent-based models (Mesoudi and O'Brien, 2008b). Fitness (hunting success) was\nderived from a different adaptive landscape than the one used in each round so that copying\nany one arrowhead would not result in an unfair advantage. After selecting an arrowhead, a\nparticipant was directed to a screen on which he or she could see the picture of the\narrowhead design and the values for each variable. On the first hunt, participants were\nrequired to use the arrowhead they had chosen previously. During all subsequent hunts,\nonce a participant made a decision to learn individually, to learn socially, or to hunt, he or\nshe could not perform either of the other actions on that hunt.\nParticipants who chose to learn individually were directed to a screen that contained\na picture of the selected arrowhead and the values for each variable. Participants could\nchange each of the three continuous variables between 1 and 100 and could change the two\ndiscrete variables to any of four states. They also could change as many of the values as\n1 The protocol for deceit suggested by the American Psychological Association was followed, and an ethics\nboard approved the manipulation.\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\ndesired or none (but still incurring the penalty for individual learning). After accepting the\nchanges, participants were returned to the hunt screen and notified of the penalty. After\nhunting, participants were shown their scores for the last hunt and told to wait for the other\nmembers of their group to finish, after which the process could be repeated.\nParticipants who chose to learn socially were taken to a screen that showed the five\narrowheads. After clicking on an arrowhead (this step did not involve actually copying the\narrowhead's values), they received information regarding prestige (attentional information).\nIn seasons 1 and 2, this information consisted of the names of the other four individuals and\nthe amount of time that each potential learner spent examining the arrowhead he or she had\nhighlighted. For example, a participant looking at arrowhead 1 might see that both\nindividuals 3 and 5 spent no time looking at arrowhead 1, whereas individual 2 spent 7\nseconds and individual 4 spent 11 seconds. In season 3, this information was expanded to\ncontain the hunting success, averaged over the last three turns, of the individual looking at\nthe arrowhead of interest (see Table 1). After examining the information, participants\nneeded to click a button to view the characteristics of the arrowhead of interest. After\nclicking, participants could not choose to learn from any other arrowhead. A participant\ncould then choose to copy any, all, or none of the given characteristics. After choosing\nwhich characteristics to copy, participants were returned to the hunt screen, after which the\nprocess could be repeated.\nAll viewing times were products of a random-number generator, but they were\nconstrained in order to be realistic. Viewing times were chosen randomly from between\nzero and 20 seconds. This did not result in a consistently prestigious individual, and the\nprestige of individuals could vary each turn. In addition, conflicting information, as given\nin the example above, was present. Viewing times were the same for all participants.\nViewing times were uncorrelated with any aspects of the arrowheads so as to avoid\nconflating success and prestige in an experimental setting. In the analysis, the time spent\nviewing a variable was a sum of all time spent looking at information for a particular\narrowhead.\nAnalytical Methods\nMultinomial logistic regression was used to predict whether any one arrowhead was\n\"learned from\"--again, a shorthand way of referring to the individual who produced a\nparticular arrowhead. This type of analysis allows us to use the full information on all of\nthe variables in the analysis. In multinomial regression, one of the predicted categories\nmust be left out of the analysis and treated as the reference category; we used arrowhead 5\nas the default. The necessity of having a reference category in multinomial regression\nshould not qualitatively impact the results, even if a different arrowhead were selected as\nthe default (see Hendrickx and Ganzeboom [1998] for a readable explanation of\nmultinomial logistic-regression models). Further, because the data are multiple turns of a\ngame conducted by an individual, they are organized hierarchically by individual. All\nanalyses were conducted using subject as a clustering variable in MPlus. This procedure\ncomputes a random intercept for each subject as implemented in MPlus using\nTYPE=TWOLEVEL (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n, 2007).\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nResults\nDid Participants Engage in Social Learning?\nA prerequisite for examining the effects of prestige bias is that participants engaged\nin social learning (prestige-biased or otherwise). Analyses confirmed that participants did\nindeed frequently engage in social learning. Figure 2, which shows the distribution of\nsocial learning--both \"observation\" and \"copying\"--in each season, indicates the\nfrequency of social learning increases each season. Season 3, in particular, has a lower\nnumber of people either never engaging in social learning or doing so only once. The\nnumber of arrowhead views that resulted in copying for each season is shown in Figure 3.\nThe proportion of arrowhead views that resulted in copying rises throughout the\nFigure 2. The mean number of hunts, by season, during which participants engaged in\nsocial learning\nNote: Boxes denote standard deviations, and whiskers denote maximum and\nminimum number of hunts during which individuals engaged in social learning.\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nFigure 3. The number of model views that resulted in copying compared to those that did\nnot\nDid Participants Use Prestige Information in Seasons 1 and 2?\nposits that individuals use prestige information when choosing a model. Results\nof the multinomial logistic regression are presented in Table 2. Conceptually, this table\npresents the results of four different logistic regressions: comparing choosing arrowhead 1\nto arrowhead 5, arrowhead 2 to arrowhead 5, and so on. Each row presents the results for\none such comparison. Row one, for example, shows the effect of attention paid to each\narrowhead model on the likelihood, expressed as odds ratios, of selecting arrowhead 1\ninstead of arrowhead 5. The columns give the parameter estimates for each independent\nvariable. Again using row one as an example, each unit increase of time that arrowhead 1\nwas looked at predicts a 2.3% greater likelihood of selecting arrowhead 1 as a teacher; each\nunit increase of time that arrowhead 2 was looked at predicts a 0.8% decreased likelihood\nof selecting arrowhead 1 as a teacher; and so on. If individuals use prestige information to\ndecide from whom to learn, we would expect to see odds ratios that statistically differ from\nand are greater than 1.0 on the diagonal in Table 2. Note that the expected results are found\nfor arrowheads 3 and 4 (significant parameter estimate >1, highlighted in green) and that\nthere appears to be a strong trend toward the expected result for arrowheads 1 and 2\n(trending parameter estimate >1, highlighted in yellow).\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nTable 2. Effect of attention paid on selection of an arrowhead from which to learn\nTotal time spent viewing each arrowhead\nArrowhead selected\nNote: All values given as odds ratios; cells shaded yellow indicate a trend in the expected direction; cells\nshaded green indicate a significant result in the expected direction; 1532 observations clustered within 80\nindividuals.\nAn example might be useful for understanding the change in likelihood of choosing\nan arrowhead model that is implied by the results in Table 2. We'll use arrowhead 4 as the\nexample. Assume that on a particular hunt arrowhead 4 was the one least looked at (3\nseconds) and arrowhead 2 was the most looked at (15 seconds). Assume that on another\nhunt the time looked at arrowhead 4 is now the highest (16 seconds). The learner would be\n62.4% (13 units of time at an increased probability of 4.8% per unit of time) more likely to\nselect arrowhead 4 on the second hunt compared to the first hunt.\nNote also that participants could look at the success of as many or as few of the five\narrowheads as they desired. Therefore, the following results may be attenuated by a\nparticipant's failure to look at the prestige information for all arrowheads. For example, it\nmay be the case that a participant looked only at arrowheads 2 and 3 and chose as his or her\nteacher the maker with the higher prestige or success, but that particular teacher may still\nhave been the third most-prestigious or successful arrowhead maker. Therefore, any effects\ndetected here would be stronger if attenuation were accounted for.\nWas Prestige Information More Likely to Be Used After an Environmental Shift?\nTo test H2\n, whether there was an increased reliance on the attentional information\ndirectly after an environmental shift, the 10 hunts directly after the shift were separated\nfrom the other hunts. This cut point was selected through qualitative observation of subjects\nas they were interacting with the game. Players appeared to have recognized and responded\nto the environmental shift by 10 turns after the shift. The logistic regressions predicting\narrowhead selection were then conducted for both sets of hunts from seasons 2 and 3. A z-\ntest was conducted to determine whether the beta values differed from each other\n(Paternoster et al., 1998). The results indicate little to no differences (z-score range: 0.91\u00ad\nWhen Given the Choice in Season 3, Did Participants Prefer to Use Prestige Information\nor Success Information?\nWe tested H3\n, the relative importance of attention paid and arrowhead success in a\nlearner choosing to learn from a specific teacher, by examining information criteria for\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nthree statistical models predicting the arrowhead selected. One model used prestige\ninformation (equation 1, Appendix 3), a second used success information (equation 2,\nAppendix 3), and a third used both prestige and success information (equation 3, Appendix\nAll three models were tested only in season 3, providing an equal sample size for\neach model. We followed a model-selection paradigm using Bayesian information criteria\n(BIC)--a measure of parsimony that rewards a model for explaining more variance and\npunishes a model for incorporating more variables. A lower BIC value indicates a better fit\nof the model to the data. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) were also investigated, and all\nresults are qualitatively identical to the BIC results. The difference between models was\ninsubstantial (see Table 3), indicating that attentional information and success information\nare equal predictors.\nTable 3. Model criterion comparisons for attention paid and success information in season 3\nModel\nLog-\nlikelihood\nEstimated\nparameters BIC BIC difference BIC weight\nNote: For BIC and BIC difference, lower numbers are better; BIC weight gives the likelihood of the\nmodel being the model truly underlying the distribution given the models provided.\nFurther, these effects are not additive, given that the full model (incorporating both\nprestige and success information) does not have a lower BIC than the other models. This\nindicates that even though prestige information was random, individuals were using\nprestige and success information in similar ways. The BIC weight tells us the likelihood of\neach of the provided models being the true model underlying the distribution of the data.\nFor this statistic, higher values are better. In this case, the model incorporating only\nprestige has a 65% chance of being the model, out of the three provided, that underlies the\ndistribution of the data.\nWhen Was Social Learning Used, If Not After an Environmental Shift?\nAlthough we showed above that social information was no more likely to be used\nafter an environmental shift, further analyses revealed that social learning was more tied to\na participant's own performance in the task. The rolling average (calculated over the last\nthree hunts) of participants engaging in copying for each season is shown in Figure 4. We\ncan see that individuals who engaged in copying were performing worse than those who\nmerely observed. Specifically, those who engaged in copying had lower rolling averages\nthan those who merely observed. In effect, these individuals had been performing worse\nover the past three hunts than they were used to. We can see that individuals opt to use\nsocial information when they are performing poorly.\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nFigure 4. The rolling average (calculated over the last three hunts) of individuals who\nengaged in copying compared to those who did not\nNote: Whiskers denote the 95% confidence intervals.\nFigure 5 shows even more clearly the impact of an individual's score on choosing\nwhether or not to copy. The seasonal average was derived by taking the total score of the\nindividual at any point in the season and dividing it by the number of hunts thus far in that\nseason. We examined differences of means in these clustered data by testing the null\nhypothesis (no difference of means), by using the Wald test of parameter constraints with\nsubject as the clustering variable. This can be interpreted as analogous to an independent-\nsamples t-test. Individuals who engaged in social learning had lower rolling averages,\ncorrected for the seasonal average, than individuals who did not learn socially (mean\nhad lower rolling averages when corrected for the seasonal average than those who merely\nseasonally corrected rolling average for those who learned becomes much lower as the\ngame progresses (\u00b51\n= \u00ad8.49). This should not be interpreted as\nevidence that social learning does not pay but rather as showing that people become better\nable to determine when to persist in a strategy and when to learn from others.\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nFigure 5. The rolling average (calculated over the last three hunts) after correcting for the\nindividual's seasonal average\nDiscussion\nPrestige-biased transmission relies on several components, all of which are\nnecessary and together sufficient to give rise to prestige bias (Henrich and Gil-White,\n2001): the production and sharing of information, the conferment of deference, the bias to\nvalue having prestige (on the part of the potential teacher), and the bias to attend to prestige\n(on the part of the learner). The theoretical benefits of using prestige-biased transmission\nhave previously been outlined (Henrich and Gil-White, 2001) and used in studies of\nimpact of prestige on social transmission have not been well examined in the laboratory.\nFollowing on from Chudek et al.'s (2012) recent demonstration that children use prestige\ninformation in model selection, the experiment reported here was designed to understand\nthe impact of attentional (prestige) information on the likelihood of an adult learner\nselecting one individual over another as a teacher, and in the context of a complex and\necologically relevant technology-design-based task.\nOur findings are consistent with the idea that attention paid to an individual impacts\nthe likelihood of that individual being chosen by a learner. In the portion of the experiment\nwhere learners had access only to attentional information regarding each individual\n(seasons 1 and 2), we found that attention paid to an individual increased the likelihood of\nthat individual being selected. This can be seen in Table 2. Our experiment also addressed\nthe issue of which strategy will be preferred, prestige bias or success bias, when both sets\nof information are present. We found that when participants are presented with both sets of\ninformation, there is no difference (see Table 3). This is all the more surprising given that\nthe prestige information was randomly generated and thus provided a poor indirect cue of\nadaptive behavior, whereas the success information provided direct and accurate\ninformation concerning adaptive behavior. This perhaps suggests that our participants are\nEffects of prestige bias on learners in novel environments\nused to using prestige cues in their everyday lives and this carries over into the laboratory,\neven when it is a suboptimal strategy.\nThis study allows us to make some broader statements regarding social learning and\ntransmission. First, as people become integrated into a novel environment, such as in the\narrowhead game, they become better at deciding when to learn from other individuals. Note\nthat in Figure 2 there is a significant trend toward a higher proportion of learning events\nthat result in copying as the game progresses through the seasons. Second, people are more\nlikely to engage in social learning when they are performing poorly. This is seen by the\ndifference in both the rolling average (see Figure 4) and the seasonally corrected rolling\naverage (see Figure 5) between those who copy and those who do not. This \"copy-when-\nunsuccessful\" strategy has been found in previous experiments (Kameda and Nakanishi,\n2003; Mesoudi, 2008) and is thought to be a generally adaptive social-learning rule found\nacross the animal kingdom (Laland, 2004). Third, as individuals spend time in a novel\nenvironment, perfecting the techniques associated with that environment, they are more\nlikely both to persist in using a technique known to be successful and to realize more\nquickly when their technique is performing poorly and change it. This is evident in the fact\nthat the seasonally corrected rolling average for those who learn socially drops each season\n(see Figure 5), which indicates that people are more sensitive to failure and likely to persist\nwith a successful technique once integrated into a novel environment. If they did not\nbecome more sensitive to failure, then their seasonally corrected averages would not have\nchanged between seasons. Similarly, if they were not so likely to persist with a given\ntechnique, then their seasonally corrected rolling average when they chose to learn would\nbe higher, at least greater than zero.\nFinally, one interesting finding was that in the context of a shifting adaptive\nlandscape, such as the one we inserted in this study, there was no evidence that individuals\nuse prestige-biased transmission at higher rates than in stable environments. One might\nhave thought that if prestige information can be seen as a reliable indicator of individual\nperformance or ability, then there would be an increase after the environment changed, but\nthis was not the case. It may be that this shift was not suitably dramatic enough to be\nnoticed or accommodated by our participants, or that the aforementioned effect of\nperforming poorly overwhelms this manipulation of the environment.\nThe precise factors that constitute prestige in natural environments have not been\nidentified. Indeed, the factors that affect prestige are likely to be highly variable across\nsocieties (Henrich and Gil-White, 2001). For example, the aged and knowledgeable do not\nenjoy greater prestige in the selection of medicinal plants among the Tsimane' (Reyes-\nGarcia et al., 2008), but the aged and knowledgeable do enjoy greater prestige in the\ndiffusion of food taboos during pregnancy and lactation in Fijians (Henrich and Henrich,\n2010). In a sample of American undergraduates, however, we found that attentional\ninformation, a valid proxy for prestige in this context, does impact an individual's choice of\nwhom to select as a teacher. We anticipate that future cross-cultural experimental and\nethnographic studies will shed light on the social and ecological factors that shape the use\nof prestige information in the human species.\n"
