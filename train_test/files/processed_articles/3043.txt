Children receive a significant proportion of the antibiotics prescribed each year\nand represent an important target group for efforts aimed at reducing unnecessary\nantibiotic use.\nObjective.--To evaluate antibiotic-prescribing practices for children younger\nthan 18 years who had received a diagnosis of cold, upper respiratory tract infec-\ntion (URI), or bronchitis in the United States.\nDesign.--Representative national survey of practicing physicians participating\nin the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey conducted in 1992 with a response\nSetting.--Office-based physician practices.\nParticipants.--Physicians completing patient record forms for patients younger\nMain Outcome Measures.--Principal diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions.\nResults.--A total of 531 pediatric office visits were recorded that included a\nprincipal diagnosis of cold, URI, or bronchitis. Antibiotics were prescribed to 44%\nof patients with common colds, 46% with URIs, and 75% with bronchitis. Extrapo-\nlating to the United States, 6.5 million prescriptions (12% of all prescriptions for\nchildren) were written for children diagnosed as having a URI or nasopharyngitis\n(common cold), and 4.7 million (9% of all prescriptions for children) were written for\nchildren diagnosed as having bronchitis.
