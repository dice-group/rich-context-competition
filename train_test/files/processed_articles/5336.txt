Self-esteem is\nnow generally conceived as a multi-dimensional construct\nencompassing a range of domain-specific self-perceptions\nmulti-faceted framework, Harter (1999) proposed a number of\nself-esteem domains related to perceptions of academic, social,\nand physical competence, as well as global self-worth, which\nrepresents an individual's overall perception of his or her value\nas a person. Harter (2012) asserts that actual competence in a\nparticular domain is a major contributor to self-perceptions,\nwith strong implications for motivation of future behavior.\nLittle is understood of the impact of level of motor com-\npetence on self-perceptions in adolescence, and in particular\nhow this may differentially affect girls and boys. Although\nresearch has demonstrated adverse psychosocial conse-\nquences of low motor competence in children, it is often\noverlooked that in the transition through adolescence into\nadulthood, lowered self-perceptions across a range of\ndomains associated with low motor competence may persist.\nAlthough not diminishing childhood as an important stage in\npsychosocial development, Kirby (2004) highlighted low\nself-perceptions in early adolescence as being particularly\npertinent to those who have low motor competence. With the\ntransition into secondary school, early adolescence is a\nperiod of biological (Malina, 1990), social, and cognitive\nchange (Montmeyer & Flannery, 1990), where relationships\nundergo dramatic transformations. As a result of these\nchanges, self-perceptions become particularly malleable\n(Brinthaupt & Lipka, 2012; Finkenauer, Rutger, Engels, &\ncho-biological changes, the early adolescent's perception of\ngender role intensifies, which, according to Harter (1993),\noccurs differently for boys and girls.\nAlthough it is logical to assume that actual level of motor\ncompetence affects perceptions of physical competence,\nstudies with children have shown that low motor competence\nalso affects other domains resulting in lowered social\n1The University of Notre Dame Australia, Fremantle, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nBeth Hands, Senior Research Scholar, Institute for Health Research, The\nUniversity of Notre Dame Australia, 19 Mouat Street, P.O.

For example,\nCantell, Smyth, and Ahonen (1994) found that the impact of\nmotor competence was limited to physical and academic\nself-perception domains. Others, however, report that the\nnegative impact of low motor competence extended to the\nsocial self-perception and global self-worth domains (Losse\nOverall, the problems for adolescents with low competence\nappear poorly acknowledged or overlooked.\nAnother issue that has received scant attention in the self-\nperception and motor competence literature is that of gender\ndifferences, which are rarely considered when comparing\nlevels of motor competence. Given that girls generally have\nlower self-perceptions than boys and that this difference\nextends across the life span (Harter, 1999; Kling, Hyde,\nShowers, & Buswell, 1999; Labbrozzi, Robazza, Bertollo,\nBucci, & Bortoli, 2013; Wigfield, Eccles, Iver, Reumann, &\nMidgley, 1991), it is probable that the relationship between\nmotor competence and self-perceptions may be influenced in\nadolescence by gender. Rose (1994) conducted one of the\nfew studies that examined gender differences as well as\nmotor competence levels and self-perceptions in 8- to\n11-year-old children. She found that gender differences\nexisted across a wide range of self-perceptions and motiva-\ntional orientation toward physical activity. Those who were\nfemale and poorly coordinated had the lowest scores.\nFurthermore, this may compound with age. Labrozzi et al.\nolds had a poorer physical perception, lower intrinsic moti-\nvation, and enjoyment of physical activity. It is not known\nwhether the coupling of being female and having low motor\ncompetence creates a further disadvantage for girls' self-per-\nceptions in early adolescence.\nIn this study, we aimed to examine self-perceptions of\n14-year-old boys and girls who differed in level of motor\ncompetence from very low to very high. We hypothesized\nthat actual level of motor competence would not only affect\nthe self-perceptions of athletic competence but also extend to\nall domains. Furthermore, we predicted that the self-percep-\ntions of adolescents with low levels of motor competence\nwould be lower than their better coordinated peers.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were drawn from the longitudinal Western\nAustralian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study (http://www.\nwomen were recruited into the study. The initial study meth-\nods have been reported elsewhere (Newnham, Evans,\nMichael, Stanley, & Landau, 1993). Data were collected\ncompleted both the motor competence and self-perception\ncomponents of the survey. Raine study families are broadly\nrepresentative of the general Western Australian population:\n10.7% of parents never married (vs. 9.8%), a lower propor-\ntion of fathers employed in managerial positions and a higher\nproportion employed in professional positions, 7.5% chil-\ndren were born <37weeks (vs. 6.5%), and slightly more chil-\nMeasures\nMotor competence was measured using the McCarron\nAssessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND;\nMcCarron, 1997) that comprises five fine motor tasks (plac-\ning beads in box, placing beads on rod, sliding a rod along a\nbar, screwing a bolt through a nut, and finger tapping) and\nfive gross motor tasks (heel toe walking, grip strength, stand-\ning broad jump, one foot balance and touching from finger,\nto nose, to finger). The overall measure of motor compe-\ntence, the Neuromuscular Developmental Index (NDI), was\nderived from participants' performance on the 10 motor\ntasks, by scaling each task according to chronological age\nand gender (M = 100, SD = 15). The participants were\ngrouped into one of four motor competence groups based on\nthe NDI score: very low (NDI < 71, n = 67), low (NDI <\ncoefficients of the MAND tasks are reported by McCarron\nMAND to be a reliable indicator of motor coordination in\nAustralian children (Hoare & Larkin, 1990). Validity of the\nMAND as a measure of motor competence was also estab-\nlished when the test was directly compared with two other\ncommonly used motor coordination tests, Bruininks\nOseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency and Movement\nAssessment Battery for Children (Tan, Parker, & Larkin,\nSelf-perceptions were assessed using Harter's (1988)\nSelf-Perception Profile for Adolescents. This is a 45-item\nquestionnaire comprising a four-level, structured, alternate-\nresponse format to measure perceptions of nine domains:\nAthletic Competence, Physical Appearance, Social\nAcceptance, Close Friendship, Romantic Appeal, Behavioral\nConduct, Job Competence, Scholastic Competence, and\nGlobal Self-Worth. Each domain score is derived from the\naverage of five statements distributed within the question-\nnaire. The participant first decides which statement is \"most\ntrue for her/him,\" for example, \"Some teenagers have a lot of\nfriends BUT other teenagers don't have very many friends.\"\nThey then decide whether the statement is \"really true\" or\n\"sort of true.\" The score for each statement ranges from 1\nRose et al. 3\n(lowest) to 4 (highest) with some items being negatively\ncoded to ensure greater validity of responses. Validity and\nreliability of the questionnaire with Australian adolescents\nhave been reported (Rose, Hands, & Larkin, 2012).\nParents or guardians provided written informed consent.\nThe Human Research Ethics Committee at Princess Margaret\nHospital provided approval to carry out the research.\nParticipants completed the questionnaire before participating\nin the MAND test, and all testing was carried out by trained\nresearch assistants.\nData Analysis\nTwo-way (Motor Competence [4] \u00d7 Gender [2]) ANOVAs\nwere applied to each of the self-perception domains. Where\nsignificant main effects, but no significant interactions, were\nrevealed in that analysis, follow-up one-way ANOVAs were\nconducted for each gender separately across the range of\ncompetence. These secondary analyses were to identify\nwhether the pattern in self-perception domain scores across\nmotor competence levels was the same for males and\nfemales. To reduce the chance of Type 1 error, given the\nsame data set was used for multiple statistical analyses, the\nstatistical significance was set at a more conservative p < .01\nfor all analyses.\nResults\nIn overview, the Motor Competence (4) \u00d7 Gender (2)\nANOVAs revealed significant main effects for both motor\ncompetence and gender in four domains: Athletic\nCompetence, Physical Appearance, Close Friendships, and\nGlobal Self-Worth. Motor competence was the only main\neffect for Social Acceptance, Scholastic Competence, and\nRomantic Appeal, and gender, the only main effect for\nBehavioral Conduct. In general, across all self-perception\ndomains, the mean ratings were lowest for the very low or\nlow (Physical Appearance) motor competence groups and\nhighest for the average (Behavioral Conduct) or high motor\ncompetence groups (Table 2). Boys had higher self-percep-\ntions of global self-worth, athletic competence, and physical\nappearance, whereas girls had higher scores for Close\nFriendships and Behavioral Conduct. There were no signifi-\ncant interactions (Table 3).\nFollowing is a more detailed description of the post hoc\nanalyses for the group differences. Only those group differ-\nences where p < .01 is reported. Tukey post hoc comparisons\nshowed that all groups were significantly different in self-per-\nceptions from each other for Athletic Competence (p < .006 to\nGlobal Self-Worth and Physical Appearance, the low, but not\nthe very low, competence groups were significantly lower than\ntively) and the high competence groups (p < .000 for both\ndomains). For Scholastic Competence and Close Friendships,\nthe very low (p < .001 for both domains) and low (p < .001 and\np < .01, respectively) groups were significantly lower than the\nhigh competence group. For Scholastic Competence, the very\nlow and low groups were also significantly lower than the\naverage group (p < .001 for both contrasts). Finally, for\nRomantic Appeal, the low competent group was significantly\nlower than the high competent group (p < .009).\nMotor Competence Differences Within Gender\nFor the four domains for which both motor competence and\ngender were main effects, the secondary analysis of self-per-\nceptions was often different for each gender (see Figure 1).\nFor Athletic Competence, the profile of self-perceptions was\nthe same for males compared with females, with higher per-\nceptions at each successive motor competence level. For\nPhysical Appearance, this analysis showed an increase in\nself-perception between the low and high motor competence\ngroups for girls only. In the Close Friendships domain,\nalthough females were significantly higher than males over-\nall (p < .001), those in the very low motor competence group\nhad lower self-perceptions than those in the high group (p <\n.007) compared with males who showed no significant\nchange in Close Friendships across motor competence lev-\nels. Although males rate their Global Self-Worth as signifi-\ncantly higher than females overall (p < .002), there were no\ncompetence group differences for either males or females\n(see Figure 1).\nDiscussion\nWe found that motor competence had a pervasive influence\non self-perceptions of young, 14-year-old adolescents that\nextended beyond the physical to social and scholastic\ndomains, as well as to global self-esteem. Similar findings\nhave been reported not only for children (Rose, Larkin, &\nTable 1.

Given that Athletic\nCompetence is the perception of ability to perform skills in\nsports and games (Harter, 1999), such a self-perception\nprofile is predictable and consistent with other studies\nactual and perceived motor competence (L. M. Barnett,\nMorgan, Van Beurden, Ball, & Lubans, 2011; Stodden\nclusion that actual competence in a domain is a major con-\ntributor to the associated self-perception. Also, as ability in\nsport is highly valued in Australian society, low motor com-\npetence is difficult to hide, and we suggest that those with\nlow motor competence avoid social comparison wherever\npossible by withdrawing from physical activities. Skinner\nand Piek (2001) reported those with low motor competence\nhad higher anxiety and perceived themselves as less com-\npetent with poorer social support. One might speculate that\nlow self-perceptions of physical competence may be a sig-\nnificant contributor to the commonly reported sports drop-\nout during adolescence (Australian Bureau of Statistics,\nThe higher perceptions of athletic competence among\nboys is not surprising given that as girls enter adolescence,\nthey often demonstrate lower intrinsic motivation and enjoy-\nment of physical activity than those younger in age (Labrozzi\net al., 2013). However, it was noteworthy that the self-\nperception scores of Athletic Competence by girls in the two\nhigher motor competence groups exceeded scores of boys in\nthe two lower groups. The boys' higher perceptions of\nPhysical Appearance may be explained by Paquette and\nUnderwood's (1999) findings that girls had lower percep-\ntions of attractiveness and greater fear of being talked about\nthan boys, although one might also contend that motor\ncompetence has an important role in personal grooming, pos-\nture, and moving confidently.\nWe found that motor competence and gender affected\nself-perceptions in other domains besides those aligned with\nthe physical domains. Self-perceptions of Close Friendships\nwere positively affected by motor competence for both boys\nand girls, but in this case, girls in all groups had consistently\nhigher self-perceptions than boys. In fact, the mean self-per-\nception scores of girls as a group for Close Friendships were\nthe highest of any domain. As this domain tapped the ability\nto make close friends and to share personal thoughts, and\ngiven that girls are more likely than boys to seek out one best\nfriend (Harter, 1999), this result could be expected.\nA number of self-perception domains were influenced\nsolely by motor competence. Scholastic Competence self-\nperception was higher for those with higher motor compe-\ntence. Many other studies (Cantell et al., 1994; Losse et al.,\nPiek, 2001) also reported that being a competent mover\nappears to be a distinct advantage in the classroom, particu-\nlarly in childhood, and was associated with positive self-per-\nceptions of academic ability. Our results demonstrate this\ncontinues into early adolescence. Although one might think\nthat those with poor motor competence might naturally shun\nphysical activity and focus on academics, our results suggest\nthat if such a focus has occurred, then actual motor compe-\ntence is still a persistent influence on perceptions of scholas-\ntic ability.\nDeveloping positive relationships with the opposite sex\nboth in and out of school is increasingly important during\nadolescence. We found that perceptions of SocialAcceptance\nand Romantic Appeal were both influenced by motor compe-\ntence only, not gender. There are social occasions such as\nschool dances and recreational activities that require moving\nwith confidence and skill, and one could surmise that those\nwith low motor competence would feel more inhibited, less\nconfident, and less socially adept to engage with their peers.\nCantell et al. (1994) had earlier reported that although ado-\nlescents with poor motor competence did not express dissat-\nisfaction with their romantic appeal, they were nevertheless\nless sociable and chose solitary leisure time activities. Such\nchoices could likely inhibit the development of positive per-\nceptions of one's social relationships.\nThe one domain affected solely by gender was Behavioral\nConduct, one that relates to behaving in the correct manner.\nRegardless of motor competence, girls as a group had sig-\nnificantly higher self-perception scores than the boys as a\ngroup. In early adolescence, many other societal influences\nthat define gender role and societal expectations of girls as\ncompared with boys would contribute to girls scoring this\ndomain higher than boys.\nThe final domain to consider is that of Global Self-Worth.\nThis domain taps the degree that one likes and values oneself\nas a person and the way one is leading his or her life and feels\ngood about himself or herself, and, according to Harter\nTable 3. Univariate Analyses for Self-Perception Subscales for\nGender and Motor Competence Groups.\nScale\nGender Group\nGender\n\u00d7 Group\nF (p) F (p) F (p)\nNote. Bold indicates p < .01.\n6 SAGE Open\n(1999), arises from both the relative contributions of the\ndomain-specific self-perceptions and the importance of each\nin the individual's life. Importantly, Harter (1999) contends\nthat Global Self-Worth is also the most difficult perception to\nalter. Accordingly, this domain provides an important,\nwholistic picture of a relatively stable self-perception. Our\nresults showed that perception of Global Self-Worth was not\nonly significantly higher for boys--similar to previous\n(1988)--but that the profile of perceptions for boys and girls\nacross motor competence groups was the same. As motor\ncompetence increased, the self-perception scores increased\nalso. This was similar to Skinner and Piek's (2001) study that\nshowed low motor competent children and adolescents had\nlower self-worth than those with normal motor coordination.\nAgain, motor competence appeared to be an enhancer of\nself-perceptions in this domain.\nBesides Global Self-Worth, we found that three quarters\nof the other domain-specific perceptions were positively\ninfluenced by motor competence, the exceptions being\nBehavioral Conduct and Job Competence. Motor compe-\ntence, however, is a personal factor that is not fixed, unlike\ngender, and is a factor that can be changed and improved. In\nlight of possible improvements in domain-specific\nself-perceptions with improved motor competence and that\nGlobal Self-Worth arises from the relative contributions of\nthese domain-specific perceptions, we argue that self-worth\nmay not be as resistant to change as Harter (1999) asserts.\nOur findings lead us to assert that motor competence is a\npervasive factor likely to strengthen perceptions of self-\nworth in young adolescents. This hypothesis could be tested\nin future intervention studies in which motor skills of those\nwith low motor competence are improved and self-percep-\ntions monitored.\nIn summary, having low motor competence and being a\ngirl were double hindrances in young adolescents forming\nhigh perceptions of their physical self. However, being a girl\nwas an advantage for higher perceptions in the friendship\nand conduct domains. Therefore, it appears that actual motor\ncompetence has a pervasive, supportive effect that strength-\nens self-perceptions in adolescent girls, not only of their\nphysical self but also in global self-esteem.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe current study has several strengths. First, motor compe-\ntence was measured using the NDI, an objective, standard-\nized, and normalized score (M = 100, SD = 15), which\nFigure 1. Plots of self-perception domains separated for males (blue) and females (red).\nNote. Gender-specific motor competence group differences are identified. a = Very low is significantly different from low; b = Very low is significantly\ndifferent from average; c = Very low is significantly different from high; d = Low is significantly different from average; e = Low is significantly different\nfrom high; f = Average is significantly different from high.\nRose et al. 7\nenabled the large number of participants to be categorized\ninto four levels of competence. This larger range enabled a\ngreater ability to discriminate self-perception characteristics\namong a wider range of motor competence. Many of the con-\nclusions have been drawn from other studies with either\ndichotomized (low compared with competent; Piek, Baynam,\n& Barrett, 2006) or three groupings (significant motor prob-\nlems, minor deficiency, and normal competence; Cantell\nFurthermore, it is rare in the motor competence literature\nto have a large participant sample that is representative of the\npopulation and covering both genders across the full range of\nmotor competence. Studies that recruit clinically based sam-\nples typically underrepresent females in comparison with\nmale participants, and consequently, gender comparisons are\nnot common in the literature.\nHowever, there are several limitations in this study that\nmay affect the generalizability of findings. First, although a\nvery large sample was measured, these data were derived\nfrom a single year snapshot within a longitudinal study\ndesign. Although it seems unlikely that self-perceptions are\nthe genesis of poor motor coordination, reverse causal rela-\ntionships are less clear. Of the many studies that have exam-\nined motor coordination problems in children, only a handful\nare longitudinal (for example, Cantell et al., 1994). More lon-\ngitudinal tracking of the psychosocial development of chil-\ndren across a full range of motor coordination is needed to\nclarify causality. Future studies should also consider the intri-\ncate and potentially circular relationship between gross motor\nimpairment and perceived competence across a range of psy-\nchosocial domains, with the explicit aim of delineating cause\nand effect (Emck, Bosscher, Beek, & Doreleijers, 2009).\nSecond, the chosen measures may not be sufficiently sen-\nsitive to fully explain the relationship between the two vari-\nables of interest. Although Harter's Scale has demonstrated\nreliability and validity, the forced choice scale based on \"sort\nof true for me\" or \"really true for me\" gives only a score range\nfrom 1 to 4 and does not allow for a neutral or \"not applicable\nat all\" response. Potentially, real psychosocial\u00adbehavioral dif-\nferences might be masked by the narrow range of values\nderived from the scale. Alternately, statistical significance in\nscores might not relate to real significance in psychosocial\nbehaviors. Furthermore, we do not know the relative impor-\ntance of these domains in the lives of young adolescents nor\ndo we know to what extent the importance placed on a domain\nis affected by level of motor competence. If one was aiming\nto improve psychosocial health of young people with poor\nmotor competence, then understanding which areas of self-\nperception are more important to them could result in more\ntargeted interventions and more meaningful outcomes.\nUnfortunately, although Harter's (1988) Scale enables such a\nmeasure to be collected, this aspect was not included in the\nquestionnaires used in the longitudinal Raine study. We rec-\nommend that investigations into self-perceptions in the future\nmeasure not only the strength of perceptions but also the\nimportance of the domains to participants.\nFinally, although the MAND is used widely as a measure\nof motor competence, it may not fully capture some aspects\nof motor competence as it does not include any object con-\ntrol skills. This omission may be important in seeking to bet-\nter understand the different associations we identified\nbetween motor competence and gender. A number of studies\nhave identified gender differences in the performance of\nmany ball skills (for example, L. M. Barnett, van Buerden,\nSummary and Conclusion\nDeveloping healthy self-esteem is affected by many per-\nsonal, social, and environmental factors, and in the transition\nfrom childhood into adolescence, the influence of motor\ncompetence on self-perceptions, in concert with gender\neffects, is not well-understood. Our results clearly indicate\nthat motor competence in early adolescence is an important\nfactor in psychosocial health and that its effect differs\nbetween males and females in a number of self-perception\ndomains, including Global Self-Worth. Together, motor\ncompetence and gender in early adolescence were significant\neffects in about half the self-perception domains measured\nby Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents Scale\nand, alone, motor competence had a significant influence in\nthe majority of these domains.\nIn conclusion, although we have investigated the mutual\neffects of only two possible influences on self-esteem, our\nfindings have important implications for building psychoso-\ncial health in adolescents. First, motor competence is a per-\nvasive influence in young adolescents' self-perceptions\nacross a number of physical, social, and academic domains;\nsecond, actual motor competence enhances self-perceptions;\nand third, the lower self-perceptions typical of girls are\nboosted by higher motor competence. This more nuanced\npicture may assist practitioners and educators to provide\nmore appropriate interventions for girls and boys at all levels\nof motor competence. We conclude that to build healthy self-\nesteem, particularly for young adolescent females, one key\nway could be to facilitate their participation in sports and\nrecreation, teach motor skills, and present opportunities to\nimprove their actual motor competence.\n"
