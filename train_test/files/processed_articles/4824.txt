Blood was collected on\npostadmission. Serum concentrations of sCD95L were determined via immunoassay.\nResult: The study included 23 patients. Mean sCD95L concentrations were significantly lower at\n4 h, 9 h, 12 h and 24 h than at admission, and were significantly higher at 8 and 12 weeks, compared\nwith admission.\nConclusion: The serum sCD95L concentration fell significantly during the first 24 h after\ntraumatic spinal cord injury. Concentrations then rose, becoming significantly higher than\nadmission levels at 8 weeks. sCD95L may represent a possible therapeutic target for traumatic\nspinal cord injury.\n",

Caspase-8 autoproteolysis results\nin activation of effector caspases (caspase-3\nand -7), inducing a mitochondrial apoptosis\nsignal and death signal amplification.12\u00ad14\nproduction of inflammatory cytokines.15\nCD95 also has effects on cellular activation,\ndifferentiation and proliferation,14 and is\ninvolved in the branching of developing\nneurons in the CNS, axonal sprouting of\ndorsal root ganglion neurons, migration of\nmalignant glioma cells, and differentiation\nof neuronal stem cells.16\nBlocking the CD95 pathway (via sub-\narachnoid infusion of sFasR,17 systemic\nantibody administration18 or genome dele-\ntion19) has been found to improve functional\noutcome and reduce apoptotic cell death\nfollowing spinal cord injury in rodents.17 The\nfindings of these studies may not be applic-\nable to humans, although a similar pattern of\ninflammatory cytokine production was seen\nin rodent spinal cords and human cerebro-\nspinal fluid (CSF) following spinal cord\ninjury.20 Our pilot study of patients with\nspinal cord injury revealed an initial increase\nfollowed by a decrease in blood sCD95L\nconcentrations, but the sample size was\ninsufficient to show statistical significance.21\nThe aim of the current study, therefore, was\nto evaluate sCD95L levels in a larger cohort\nof patients with spinal cord injury, to deter-\nmine whether sCD95L could be used as a\ntherapeutic target.\nPatients and methods\nThe study included all patients with acute\nspinal cord injury who were treated at the BG\nTrauma Centre Ludwigshafen, Department\nof Paraplegiology, Ludwigshafen, Germany,\nExclusion criteria were: nontraumatic spinal\ninjury; brain injury; infectious disease;\nrheumatological conditions; endocrino-\nlogical disease; cancer; autoimmune condi-\ntions; coma.

A test for normal distribution between\ngroups was not used because of the small\npatient pool.

These findings are in\naccordance with those of our pilot study21\nand the work of others.24\nIt is well documented that blocking the\nsCD95L signalling pathway leads to an\nimprovement in neurological deficit after\nconcentrations in white brain matter\nincrease in the first 8 h following injury.27\nThere was a significant fall in sCD95L\nconcentration immediately after injury in\nhumans in the present study, followed by an\nincrease after 24 h. It is possible that block-\ning the CD95 signalling pathway in its\nearliest phase might be therapeutically\neffective. More precise temporal informa-\ntion concerning sCD95L concentration is\nneeded in order to determine the timepoint\nwhen a goal-oriented therapy would be most\neffective in paitents with acute spinal cord\ninjury. Studies concerning cytokine expres-\nsionhave shown that rodents and humans\nrelease the same inflammatory cytokines\nafter traumatic injury to the spinal cord,\nthough they were detectable later in human\nCSF than in mice.20 This may explain the\ndifferences observed between human and\nanimal studies relating to the timing of\nchanges in CD95L concentration.\nA postmortem human study found that\nboth apoptosis and inflammatory response\nin the acute and subacute phases after spinal\ncord injury,28 and that both proapoptotic\nand proinflammatory activity were function-\nally important. The role of autoimmunity is\nunclear, with some studies indicating a\nneurotoxic effect29\u00ad31 and others a neuro-\nprotective one.32 It remains to be elucidated\nwhether there are different roles for the\nsoluble and membrane-bound forms of\nwere unable to kill targeted cells, suggesting\nthat mCD95L is responsible for cytotoxic\nactivity and initiating apoptosis, rather than\nfor immunological activity.33 Mice injected\nwith sCD95L developed an autoimmune\nresponse,34 but others have shown that\nSome studies have shown that recombinant\nsCD95L, in contrast to human sCD95L, has\nno effect on apoptosis.10,35 In this context,\nthe relationship between neurological out-\ncome and sCD95L concentration in a larger\ncohort population would be of interest. Our\nstudy showed no significant difference in\nTable 2.

This is most likely\ndue to the small number of patients after\nstratification according to American Spinal\nInjury Association Impairment Scale\ngrades.36 The current study has several\nlimitations, most notably the absence of a\ncontrol group comprising patients with ver-\ntebral bone fracture and without neuro-\nlogical deficit. This is due to the\nconsiderably shorter hospitalization of\nsuch control patients. A further limitation\nis the short duration of follow-up; a longer\nfollow-up would be interesting but is diffi-\ncult to manage. Finally, it would be of\nconcentrations. Furthermore, properly con-\ntrolled, larger-scale studies are required to\nsupport our findings.\nIn conclusion, the serum sCD95L con-\ncentration falls significantly during the first\n24 h after traumatic spinal cord injury.\nsCD95L concentrations then rise, becoming\nsignificantly higher than admission levels at\n8 weeks. sCD95L may represent a possible\ntherapeutic target for traumatic spinal cord\ninjury.\n"
