We review the use of these data for performing\nanalyses that address cancer-related objectives. After de-\nscribing the conduct of a large-scale health survey (the third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n[NHANES III]), we discuss some of the issues involved in\nanalyzing data collected in such a survey. In particular, the\nuse of sample weights in the analysis and the importance of\naccounting for the complex survey design when estimating\nstandard errors are discussed. Six applications are then pre-\nsented that involve the following: 1) estimating demographic\nfactors associated with snuff use, 2) estimating the associa-\ntion of type of health insurance with the probability of re-\nceiving a digital rectal examination, 3) estimating the asso-\nciation of body iron stores with the probability of later\ndeveloping cancer, 4) estimating the changing rates of mam-\nmography screening in the United States between 1987 and\n1992, 5) evaluating smoking and alcohol consumption as risk\nfactors for digestive cancer by use of a population-based,\ncase\u00adcontrol study, and 6) evaluating a randomized commu-\nnity-intervention experiment to encourage smoking cessa-\ntion. These applications use data from the National Health\nInterview Survey, the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup\nStudy, the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey, and\nthe Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation.\nThe availability of public-use data files is discussed for sur-\nveys sponsored by the U.S. government that collect health-\nrelated information. We demonstrate that statistical meth-\nods and computer software are available for analyzing\npublic-use data files of surveys to address different types\nHealth surveys provide a wealth of information about the\nincidence and prevalence of diseases, the occurrence of healthy\nand unhealthy behaviors, exposures to potential risk factors, di-\netary intake, physiologic measures of the population, and costs\nand utilization of health services. The large sample sizes of some\nhealth surveys, typically conducted by government agencies,\nenable one to study relatively small--but important--\nassociations between variables, relatively rare events, and sub-\npopulations of interest. Since appropriate statistical methods can\nmake the results of an analysis of survey data representative of\nthe population sampled, repeated surveys of the same population\ncan be used to evaluate trends in the population. In addition,\nfollow-up of individuals sampled in a baseline survey allows one\nto measure change at the individual level and to associate base-\nline risk factors with the development of diseases. Table 1\npresents examples of the wide variety of cancer-related analyses\nthat have been published using some selected health surveys.\nIn this review, we examine the use of data from large-scale\nhealth surveys to address cancer-related objectives. The health\nsurveys that we consider are surveys that are representative of\nwell-defined large populations, such as the U.S. population. In\nwhat follows, 1) we describe the design and conduct of such a\nsurvey, the third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III), for those not familiar with this type of\ninvestigation; 2) we describe two aspects of survey data that can\ncomplicate an analysis, the sample weights associated with the\nobservations and the clustering of the observations, and describe\nthe statistical methods that are used to handle these complica-\ntions; 3) we present six applications involving different types of\ncancer-related research questions and analyses using health sur-\nvey data; 4) we discuss the availability of public use data files\nfor U.S. government-sponsored surveys that collect health-\nrelated information; and 5) we describe some limitations of us-\ning survey data for analyses. The goal of this review is to in-\ncrease awareness of the types of health survey resources that are\navailable for cancer-related investigations and to encourage their\nincreased utilization.\nNHANES III is the seventh in a series of surveys that began\nin 1960 to examine the health of the U.S. population (40). Its\ngoals are as follows [(40), p. 1]: \"1) to estimate the national\nprevalence of selected diseases and risk factors; 2) to estimate\nnational population reference distributions of selected health pa-\nrameters; 3) to document and investigate reasons for secular\ntrends in selected diseases and risk factors; 4) to contribute to an\nunderstanding of disease etiology; and 5) to investigate the natu-\nral history of selected diseases.\" NHANES III sampled approxi-\nThe population sampled consisted of civilian, noninstitutional-\nized individuals, 2 months of age or older. In NHANES III,\nsampled individuals were first interviewed in their homes. To\ndecide who to sample, if one had a list of all individuals in the\nUnited States, one could imagine taking a \"simple random\nsample\" from the list. This is equivalent to putting all of the\nnames in a hat and pulling out 40000 at random. However, this\nwould not be a practical sampling design because then inter-\nviewers would have to travel to 40 000 locations dispersed\nacross the country. In addition, sampled individuals were asked\nto go for a physical examination to a mobile examination center,\nwhich could be set up at only a limited number of sites.

Graubard, Ph.D., National Institutes of Health,\nSee \"Note\" following \"References.\"\nfore, rather than using a simple random sample, NHANES III\nused a \"multistage sampling design,\" in which 81 counties (or\nsometimes two or more adjacent smaller counties) were first\nsampled, and then individuals within each sampled county were\nsubsampled. The mobile examination centers needed to be po-\nneighboring areas were examined over a 4- to 6-week period.\nThe 81 selected counties (or areas) were not chosen as a\nsimple random sample from a list of all such areas in the United\nStates. Instead, to decrease the variability of parameter estima-\ntors based on data from the completed survey, large-population\ncounties were sampled with a higher probability than small-\npopulation counties. Also, since one of the design considerations\nof NHANES III was to provide reliable estimates for the Afri-\ncan-American and Mexican-American minority groups, counties\nwith larger proportions of these minorities were included in the\nsample with higher probabilities. The sampling of certain sub-\npopulations with higher probabilities than others is a hallmark of\nlarge surveys. NHANES III used \"stratified sampling,\" in which\nthe units to be sampled were divided into a small number of\ngroups (\"strata\") and then sampled at different rates in the dif-\nferent strata.\nFor a sampled county, the second stage of sampling in\nNHANES III involved sampling area segments consisting of city\nor suburban blocks or other contiguous geographic areas con-\ntained within the county. Segments with larger minority popu-\nlations were sampled with higher probability. The third stage of\nsampling involved listing all of the households within the\nsampled segments and then sampling them at a rate that de-\npended on the segment characteristics, e.g., racial or ethnic com-\nposition. The fourth stage of sampling was to sample individuals\nwithin sampled households to be interviewed. The probabilities\nof individuals being chosen in this final stage of sampling were\nbased on their sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Because of design\nconsiderations, only about one in five households sampled con-\ntributed sampled persons who were interviewed.\nThe NHANES III household interview consisted of an indi-\nvidual questionnaire for each sampled person, blood pressure\nmeasurements for persons aged 17 years and over, and a family\nquestionnaire. The questionnaires contained questions about di-\netary intake and nutritional status, reproductive history and sex-\nual behavior, use of vitamin and mineral supplements and medi-\ncations, tobacco and alcohol use, physical activity, health care\nutilization and health insurance, and sociodemographic charac-\nteristics. Sampled persons who completed a household interview\nwere invited to have a medical examination at a mobile exami-\nnation center; transportation and a small cash payment were\nprovided. The examinations included additional dietary and\nhealth interviews, body measurements, physical and dental ex-\naminations, venipuncture, urine collection, audiometry, x-rays,\nelectrocardiograms, spirometry, oral glucose tolerance tests,\nophthalmologic examinations, ultrasonography, bone density\nmeasurements, cognitive assessments, and allergy tests. Exami-\nnation data were recorded, for the most part, directly into an\nautomated data collection system.\nMany of the statistical issues involved in analyzing survey\ndata are the same as encountered when analyzing nonsurvey\ndata. The two characteristics of survey data that most complicate\nTable 1.

In this section, we discuss\nthese characteristics and methods for accommodating them in\nthe analysis.\nThe data from each sampled individual are associated with a\nsample weight, which estimates the number of people in the\npopulation that he or she represents. To calculate these weights,\nconsideration is taken of the differential probabilities that indi-\nviduals were sampled, so that individuals sampled from a sub-\ngroup at a rate of one per 10 000 have larger sample weights than\nindividuals sampled from a subgroup at a rate of one per 1000.\nSample weights also adjust for the facts that not all sampled\nindividuals participate in a survey (\"nonresponse\"), and inad-\nvertently not all individuals may have had a chance to be\nsampled (\"frame undercoverage\"). These adjustments, which are\nbased on statistical models, are thought to typically lessen bias\ndue to nonresponse and frame undercoverage, but there are no\nguarantees that they accomplish this.\nThe classic approach to analyzing data with sample weights\nis to use (sample-)weighted estimators. Weighted estimation is\nequivalent to performing standard (unweighted) estimation on a\nnew expanded dataset created from the original dataset of the\nsampled observations by duplicating each observation the num-\nber of times given by its sample weight. For example, an indi-\nvidual with a sample weight of 12 239 would have his or her data\nappearing 12 239 times in the expanded dataset. Of course, there\nare simple formulas for performing weighted estimation that do\nnot require actually duplicating observations. In addition, one\ncannot calculate standard errors of parameter estimators using\nstandard nonsurvey formulas applied to the expanded dataset,\nbut other methods are required as described below.\nThe advantage of using weighted estimation over using un-\nweighted estimation is that weighted estimators are estimating\npopulation parameters and not parameters that depend on the\nparticular sample design used in the survey. In addition, un-\nweighted estimation can sometimes give misleading results\nwhen estimating cause/effect relationships (41). A disadvantage\nof using weighted estimation is that parameter estimators can be\nvery variable when the weights are very variable, especially\nwhen a few individuals have very large sample weights. Because\nof this potential, there has been some debate in the statistical\nliterature concerning the role of sample weights in the analysis\nof survey data [e.g., (42,43)]. Our own approach is to use\nweighted estimation either when the analysis is primarily de-\nscriptive (as opposed to investigating cause/effect relationships)\nor when weighted estimation does not greatly increase the vari-\nability of estimators. Otherwise, we use unweighted estimation\nwith variables that are used to construct the sample weights\nadditionally included in the analysis model (44).\nWhen estimating standard errors for parameter estimators by\nuse of survey data, one needs to take into account the fact that\nthe data are typically clustered. For example, in NHANES III,\nthere are a few hundred observations in each sampled county.\nSince data from the same cluster tend to be more correlated than\ndata from different clusters, clustering tends to make standard\nerrors larger than would be obtained from a simple random\nsample with the same sample size (45). (This problem is not\nunique to survey data; analysts of animal litter data need to\naccount for the correlation of observations within litters.) For-\ntunately, simple techniques have been developed to estimate\nstandard errors that require only a designation for each indi-\nvidual of the cluster at the first stage of sampling to which he or\nshe belongs (46). [This is true provided that either the fraction of\nfirst-stage units sampled is relatively small or the inference re-\nquired is for the assumed model underlying the generation of the\ndata; see (47).] These first-stage sampling clusters are called\n\"primary sampling units.\" Public-use data files for most health\nsurveys contain the primary sampling unit designations of each\nsampled individual. An exception is some institutional surveys,\ne.g., the National Hospital Discharge Survey (48), where there\nare confidentiality concerns in releasing information about the\nhospitals (which are the primary sampling units). For these sur-\nveys, approximate methods for standard error estimation involv-\ning \"variance curves\" (\"generalized variance functions\") have\nbeen developed (46).\nAn alternative approach to estimating standard errors, which\nmight be attractive to a statistician unfamiliar with survey meth-\nods, would be to model all of the stages of sampling with fixed\nand random effects [e.g., (49)]. However, we have shown on\ntheoretical grounds that such modeling, besides being overly\ncomplex, does not automatically improve standard error estima-\ntion (50). The one instance when simple survey methods do\nrequire some modification is when the sample design is such that\nonly a small number of primary sampling units are available for\nstandard error estimation, e.g., 16 in the Hispanic Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (51). We have given recommen-\ndations for this special situation elsewhere (44).\nFuller discussions of the statistical issues involved in analyz-\nAPPLICATIONS\nOne can categorize analyses of health surveys for cancer-\nrelated objectives in various ways: by type of outcome (inci-\ndence of cancer, death from cancer, presence of a cancer risk\nfactor, and utilization of a cancer-screening modality), by type\nof study design (cross-sectional, longitudinal, and case\u00adcontrol),\nand by type of surveys used in the analysis (single cross-\nsectional survey, single longitudinal survey, multiple cross-\nsectional surveys of the same population, and multiple cross-\nsectional surveys of different populations). The six applications\npresented in this section were chosen to provide interesting ex-\namples of all of these categories and to demonstrate the different\nways survey data have been used to address cancer-related is-\nsues.\nWe utilized the computer software SUDAAN (70) and some\nof our own computer programs to perform the analyses. Other\ncommercial software designed for survey analyses could equally\nFactors Associated With Snuff Use, Derived From the\nSmokeless tobacco, i.e., snuff and chewing tobacco, have a\nnumber of adverse health effects (72). By use of data from the\ndeveloped to identify individuals at higher risk of using snuff\nbased on their characteristics. Such an identification could be\nuseful for targeting prevention initiatives. Table 2, A, contains\nthe estimated proportions of men aged at least 18 years old who\nuse snuff for each of the categories of a group of descriptive\nvariables. We see, for example, that snuff use is low in the\nNortheast, in central cities, and among blacks and Hispanics.\nThe percentages in Table 2, A, are sample-weighted estimates,\nso that they are representative of the U.S. civilian noninstitu-\nFor some applications, the univariate descriptive analyses\ngiven in Table 2, A, might be sufficient to address the relevant\nissues, for example, suggesting areas to target for a national\nadvertising campaign to reduce snuff use. However, the results\nin this table have a major limitation: They do not provide esti-\nmates of the probabilities of snuff use for various combinations\nof levels of the independent variables. One could approach this\nby estimating proportions of snuff use cross-classified by more\nthan one variable, for example, for each of the 16 (i.e., 4 \u00d7 4)\ncells defined by combinations of race-by-region categories.\nHowever, the sample sizes in these cells may become too small\nto yield reliable estimators of the proportions, especially if one\ncross-classifies by more than two variables.\nInstead of cross-classifications, a logistic regression analysis\ncan be used to model the probability of snuff use as a function\nof the levels of all the independent variables (Table 2, B). For\nexample, by use of the estimated logistic regression coefficients\nin Table 2, B, one can estimate the probability of snuff use as\n5.2% for a 40-year-old white individual who lives in the South\nin a non-Metropolitan Statistical Area, has 12 years of education\nTable 2, A.

The interpretation of the in-\ndividual regression coefficients in Table 2, B, is the same as that\nfor a logistic regression in the nonsurvey setting. For example,\nthe coefficient for a categorical independent variable not in-\nvolved in an interaction is the logarithm of the estimated odds\nratio (relative risk) of that category compared with the baseline\ncategory. For example, the estimated odds ratio associated with\nbeing unmarried is 0.88  exp(-.013). Note that this odds ratio\nis less than 1.0, which is the opposite of what is suggested by\nTable 2, A. However, the logistic regression result controls for\npossible imbalances in the other variables (e.g., age) between\nmarried and unmarried individuals.\nDigital Rectal Examinations and Type of Health Insurance\nCoverage by Using the 1992 National Health Interview\nSurvey\nThe American Cancer Society recommends annual digital\nrectal examinations for individuals aged 40 years or over for\ncancer screening (73). Of interest is the association of the prob-\nability that an individual has had an annual digital rectal exami-\nnation with his or her type of health insurance; a full analysis\nincluding other types of cancer screening is given elsewhere\n(13). The third column of Table 3 shows the estimated propor-\ntions of digital rectal examinations cross-classified by type of\nhealth insurance, by use of the Cancer Control Supplement to the\nterms of a causal association between health insurance and the\nprobability of examination, the observed proportions can be mis-\nleading because they do not control for patient characteristics.\nThus, for example, the estimated proportion for individuals with\npublic health insurance may appear low because these individu-\nals have a lower income, and income is positively associated\nwith the probability of examinations.\nColumn 4 of Table 3 shows the predictive margin for the\nprobability of digital rectal examination controlling for the de-\nmographic variables given in footnote \u00a7 of the table. The method\nof predictive margins is a form of direct standardization by use\nof a regression model and has been developed for handling\ndichotomous outcomes analyzed with the use of nonlinear mod-\nels like logistic regression (60,75). The predictive margin in the\nfourth column of Table 3 represents the probability of an ex-\namination for a hypothetical population with the same distribu-\ntion of demographic characteristics as the 1992 NHIS, but where\nall of the individuals had each one of the health insurance types\nin turn. Controlling for individual characteristics in this way, we\nsee that the estimated probability of an examination for the\npublic health insurance group is actually higher than the other\ngroups.\nThe predictive margin in the fifth column of Table 3 esti-\nmates the probability of an examination for a population with the\nsame distribution of individual characteristics as the subgroup\nwith no health insurance, but where all of the individuals had\neach one of the health insurance types in turn. This predictive\nmargin is relevant if one was contemplating what would happen\nto the probabilities if the individuals with no insurance obtained\ndifferent kinds of health insurance.\nBody Iron Stores and Risk of Developing Cancer, Derived\nFrom the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study\nThe first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES I) was conducted during the period from 1971\nin this survey (or their proxies) have been periodically contacted\nconcerning their health status as part of the NHANES I Epide-\nmiologic Followup Study. This longitudinal study allows for\nestimating the association of risk factors measured at the base-\nline survey (and possibly updated with information from the\nfollow-ups) with the development of various diseases. This type\nof longitudinal analysis could also be approached with a single\ncross-sectional survey by asking sampled individuals for a his-\ntory of their risk factors. However, longitudinal surveys have the\nadvantage that individuals sampled in the baseline survey--but\nwho later die--provide important information, whereas obtain-\ning information about dead individuals is problematic in a cross-\nsectional survey. In addition, individuals in a cross-sectional\nsurvey may not be able to recall accurately their risk factor\nexposures from the past, and certain risk factors that require\nimmediate evaluation (such as blood chemistries) would not be\navailable.\nIn this section, we estimate the association of transferrin satu-\nration, a measure of body iron stores, with the development of\ncancer. This association was previously studied as part of a more\ncohort of NHANES I because the blood chemistry variables\nwere measured only for that cohort. Individuals with cancer at\nthe baseline survey are excluded from the analysis. Stevens et al.\n(30) expressed the theoretical concern that preclinical cancer\nmight affect serum chemistry values and therefore restricted\nanalysis to individuals who were alive and cancer free for at least\n4 years after the baseline survey. For the same reason, in our\nTable 3.

The same as in a\nproportional-hazards regression used to analyze a randomized\nclinical trial, the regression coefficient for a variable is inter-\npreted as the logarithm of the relative hazard associated with a\nchange in one unit in that variable. So, for example, the inter-\nquartile range (75th percentile minus 25th percentile) of trans-\nferrin saturation for men in this population is 13.7, and the\nrelative hazard associated with this difference is 1.22 \npositively associated with the risk of cancer for men; see also\nFig. 1. For women, the association is not statistically signifi-\ncantly different from zero.\nThe analyses shown in Table 4 do not use the sample weights\nbecause, for NHANES I, the sample weights are very variable,\nwhich leads to very large standard errors of estimated weighted\nregression coefficients. Therefore, we use unweighted estima-\ntors but include as additional independent variables the variables\nthat were used in constructing the sample weights (race, income,\nand enumeration district). The sample clustering is taken into\naccount in the analyses in Table 4, by the use of the primary\nsampling unit designations of the individuals available on the\npublic-use data files.\nBeside using the clustering in the data, there are some other\nimportant methodological differences between the analyses\nshown in Table 4 and the typical analysis of a randomized clini-\ncal trial. (Since these differences are somewhat technical, some\nreaders may wish to skip the rest of this paragraph.) (a) In a\ntypical analysis of a randomized clinical trial, one would start\nthe time axis at the time of randomization, which is usually close\nto the diagnosis of a certain stage of disease or the start of\ntreatment. The time scale here is taken as age rather than time\nfrom the baseline survey because age is a more important de-\nterminant of the risk of cancer than time from the baseline sur-\nvey for a healthy population (65). (b) Note that transferrin satu-\nration is being measured only once for each individual, at the\ntime of his or her baseline survey. The possibility that transferrin\nTable 4.

This type of follow-\nup provides less information than a personal contact but can be\nquite useful for studying associations with causes of death.\nChanging Rates of Mammography Screening by Use of the\nNational Health Interview Survey\nMany of the annual National Health Interview Surveys in-\nclude supplemental questionnaires that contain questions on can-\n1992 surveys contained similar questions about mammography\nmammography screening. We focus here on women more than\n40 years of age and on whether or not they reported a screening\nmammographic examination in the last year. In particular, we\nexamine how the percentages of these women reporting a\nscreening mammographic examination are changing over time\nand whether the time trends are different depending on the ed-\nucational levels of the women. Similar analyses with the 1987\nand 1990 surveys have been previously performed (3).\nTable 5 shows the estimated percentages of women reporting\nscreening mammograms, cross-classified by level of education.\nThe percentage of women reporting screening mammograms is\npears that the increases are similar for the different educational\nlevels. This could be formally checked by performing further\nanalyses, which could also control for additional variables, such\nas race and whether or not the woman lived in an urban or rural\narea.\nAn interesting statistical consideration in analyzing these data\nis that, although the individuals sampled in each survey are\ndifferent, the estimated percentages given in Table 5 are not\nstatistically independent. This is because the same set of\nsampled counties (primary sampling units) were used for the\nNational Health Interview Survey in the years from 1985\nthrough 1994. This is taken into account in the joint analysis of\nmultiple years of the survey by use of the primary sampling unit\nsample design for any one year of the survey when estimating\nstandard errors.\nSmoking and Alcohol Consumption as Risk Factors for\nDigestive Cancer Using the 1986 National Mortality\nFollowback Survey and the 1987 National Health\nInterview Survey\nWe used data from the 1987 National Health Interview Sur-\nSurvey (1986 NMFS) to estimate digestive cancer death rates\nand their association with alcohol consumption and smoking.\nThe 1986 NMFS is an example of a \"followback\" survey, in\nwhich individuals associated with sampled records are inter-\nviewed for further information. In this case, the records are death\ncertificates, but other followback surveys use other types of\nrecords, e.g., birth certificates (80). In this section, we follow the\ngeneral approach of Sterling et al. (35), who used the 1987 NHIS\nand the 1986 NMFS to examine the association of smokeless\ntobacco with oral and digestive cancer mortality. These surveys\ncan be used together to estimate the death rates, where the nu-\nmerators of the rates are estimated from the 1986 NMFS and the\ndenominators are estimated from the 1987 NHIS. This is an\nexample of a population-based, case\u00adcontrol study. Two advan-\ntages of a population-based, case\u00adcontrol study over a study that\nis not population based (e.g., hospital case patients with hospital\ncontrol patients) are that many of the biases involved in choos-\ning an appropriate control population are eliminated, and one\ncan estimate death rates in addition to relative risks.\nBecause the information on deaths and alive individuals come\nfrom two different surveys, biases can arise because the modes\nof data collection of the surveys are different (mail response\nfrom an informant for the decedent for the 1986 NMFS and\nface-to-face interview for the 1987 NHIS) and the questions\nasked are different. In addition, the populations sampled differ in\nways other than vital status. For example, the 1987 NHIS\nsampled only civilians and noninstitutionalized individuals, and\nyears or older. To make the populations sampled in the two\nsurveys comparable, the analysis is restricted to civilians aged\n25 years or older who, if they died, were institutionalized less\nthan half of their last year of life.\nTable 5.

The outcome variable is death\ndue to digestive cancer in 1986, defined by an underlying cause\nNMFS public-use data files include a variable coded for this\ndigestive cancer deaths and from 1560 observations of the\n19240 living individuals was partially or completely missing.\nRather than just eliminating from the analyses these observa-\ntions with missing drinking or smoking data, we used a \"hot-\ndeck\" imputation to fill in their missing data with the data from\nrandomly chosen individuals with nonmissing data who were\nsimilar to the individuals with the missing data [(82), p. 62\u00ad67];\neach donor was chosen to be in the same age/race/sex category,\nand, if available, the same smoking or drinking category as the\nrecipient. Imputation is a common technique in the analysis of\nsurveys to minimize potential bias in measuring associations due\nto missing data. In the present application, in which the amount\nof missing drinking/smoking data is larger for the 1986 NMFS\nthan the 1987 NHIS, the imputation also serves to keep the rates\nin Table 6, A, from being biased low.\nBeside taking account of sample design, there are two addi-\ntional statistical subtleties in calculating the standard errors\ngiven in Table 6, A. The first is that, even though we are only\ninterested in digestive cancer deaths, it is important not to just\ndelete the other deaths from the dataset when performing the\nanalysis. It can be shown that this will lead to standard errors\nbeing estimated incorrectly (59). Instead, all of the deaths should\nbe kept in the analysis dataset and the subpopulation of interest\n(e.g., digestive cancer deaths) should be specified in the code of\nthe computer software used for the analysis. The second subtlety\nconcerns the imputation for the missing data. The standard errors\nshown in Table 6, A, treat the imputed data as if they were real\ndata and thus are underestimates. Unfortunately, to our knowl-\nedge, at this time commercial computer software for surveys\ndoes not exist that can properly take account of the fact that\nsome data have been imputed. However, calculations by use of\nour own computer programs show that the effect on the standard\nerrors for this particular application are small (results not\nshown).\nTable 6, A.

For\nexample, individuals in the three smoking categories have mean\nages of 47, 43, and 57 years, respectively, so that the differences\nin the observed cancer death rates could easily be due to the age\ndifferences. A logistic regression analysis of digestive cancer\ndeaths was performed with the independent variables being sex,\nrace, age, smoking, and drinking (results not shown). By use of\nthis regression, we calculated the predictive margin for drinking,\nsmoking, and drinking by smoking (Table 6, B). When control-\nling for age, we see no association of smoking and digestive\ncancer death rates (last row of Table 6, B). There is, however, an\nassociation of drinking and digestive cancer mortality (last col-\numn of Table 6, B). The exact pattern of the association of\ndrinking and the rates seems to depend on level of smoking; we\nhave no plausible explanation for this pattern.\nAn early example of a population-based, case\u00adcontrol study\nusing separate samples of deaths and living individuals is given\nby Haenszel et al. (83). They used a 10% sample of all deaths in\nthe United States in 1958 and information collected from a\nsupplement to the Current Population Survey in May 1958 to\nstudy the associations of smoking and residence (urban versus\nrural) with lung cancer mortality. Most population-based, case\u00ad\ncontrol studies do not sample deaths but use information on all\nof the case patients in certain geographic areas (e.g., obtained\nfrom tumor registries) and a sample of control subjects from the\nsame areas (e.g., by use of telephone surveys). For example,\nBrinton et al. (84) attempted to interview all of the women who\nwere newly diagnosed with breast cancer during a fixed time\nperiod identified by tumor registries in three geographic areas\nand used telephone surveys of the same areas to ascertain the\ncontrol population.\nCOMMIT, a Community Intervention Trial of Smoking\nCessation\nThe Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation\n(COMMIT) was an experiment in which one community from\neach of 11 matched community pairs was randomly assigned to\na 4-year community level intervention to help smokers quit\nsmoking (85,86). The other community from each matched pair\nserved as a control for comparison purposes. The two commu-\nnities within each pair were matched for geographic location,\npopulation size, general sociodemographic factors, and esti-\nmated smoking prevalence rates. Although there were multiple\nobjectives and analyses of COMMIT, we focus here on the\neffects of the intervention on the prevalence of adult cigarette\nsmoking, one of the secondary analyses. These effects were\nassessed by performing telephone surveys in the 22 communities\n(87). The telephone surveys used list-assisted random-digit di-\naling, in which blocks of 100 consecutive telephone numbers\nwere first classified into two strata, depending on whether one or\nmore numbers in the block were listed in residential telephone\ndirectories. Telephone numbers in blocks with residential num-\nbers were sampled at a higher rate. The sample sizes and popu-\nlation sizes of the community surveys were varied but averaged\nperformed before the randomization.\nTable 7 shows the estimated smoking prevalence for each of\nthe communities before and after the intervention. Averaged\nover the 11 intervention communities, the smoking prevalence\never, the smoking prevalence also went down in the 11 com-\nparison communities an average of 2.7 percentage points, from\npoint advantage in the lowering of the smoking prevalence over\nthe comparison, with a 90% confidence interval for this advan-\ntage given by (-0.74 to 1.28). One can conclude that the inter-\nvention did not have an impact on smoking prevalence beyond\nthe general decreasing time trends. This study reinforces the\nimportance of having a control group; without such a group, one\nmight have incorrectly assumed that the intervention was suc-\ncessful in lowering smoking prevalence.\nIf a survey is required of individuals living in a relatively\nsmall geographic area, e.g., of the control population associated\nwith patient information obtained from a tumor registry, then\ninvestigators can hire a private organization to perform the sur-\nvey for them. This is also a reasonable option for a more widely\ndispersed population if there exists a list of the individuals in the\npopulation to be sampled, e.g., physicians who are board certi-\nfied in a certain specialty. Obtaining national estimates for the\ngeneral population is a much larger undertaking. Fortunately,\nmany U.S. government agencies make the data available from\nthe surveys that they sponsor to investigators who are interested\n1993, expressed as percentage of adults smoking\nCommunity pair\nIntervention communities Comparison communities\nDifference*\n*Difference in change in intervention community minus the change in comparison community.\nin performing their own analyses. These data can be obtained in\ncomputer-readable form at many university and government li-\nbraries or computer centers and are also available directly from\nmany government-agency websites.\nThe \"Appendix\" section contains a list of such surveys that\ncollect health information on a national scale. Some of these\nsurveys are focused on health information, whereas others col-\nlect health-related information peripherally. We have not tried to\nrestrict this list to surveys collecting cancer-related information\nbecause any health-related variable could conceivably be of in-\nterest to a cancer-related investigation. We do not claim that this\nlist of surveys is exhaustive and suggest contacting the indi-\nvidual agencies for further information about their surveys; see\nalso the FEDSTATS website (www.fedstats.gov) and the web-\nsite of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social\nResearch, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan\n(www.icpsr.umich.edu).\nBesides the information collected in the surveys listed in the\n\"Appendix\" section, investigators also have the option of col-\nlaborating with one of the government sponsors to have certain\nrequired information collected in the future sample of one of the\ncontinuing surveys. This approach is useful only for long-term\nprojects, since the time span for a national survey from idea for\ndata collection to data availability can be years.\nAlthough the focus of this review has been surveys, it is\nuseful to note that health-related data are also available for some\nvariables on essentially the whole population. For example, the\nNational Center for Health Statistics makes available data files\nthat have information on every birth and death occurring within\nthe United States (\"vital statistics\"), and the Health Care Fi-\nnancing Administration has information available on all Medi-\ncare claims in the United States. Interested investigators should\ncontact the relevant agencies for information about what re-\nsources are available.\nNational health surveys will generally not contain sufficient\nnumbers of sampled individuals to estimate directly parameters\nfor small geographic areas, e.g., county-specific rates. Although\nstatistical methods, usually referred to as \"small area estima-\ntion,\" have been developed to estimate indirectly such param-\neters (88), for many applications it will be necessary to perform\na survey of the particular geographic area needed. This was the\nsituation in the breast cancer population-based, case\u00adcontrol\nstudy mentioned previously, in which telephone surveys were\nperformed in the geographic areas where the case patients were\nidentified. National health surveys may also not contain suffi-\ncient numbers of individuals in special populations (e.g., Native\nAmericans, the oldest-old) to perform analyses restricted to\nthese populations. Some surveys oversample some special popu-\nlations to be able to provide reliable inferences for them. (It is\ninteresting to note that the use of sample-weighted estimators\nallows one to also make valid national estimates from these\nsurveys despite the oversampling.)\nIt is sometimes possible to avoid the problem of small sample\nsizes sampled by health surveys in local geographic areas and\nsubpopulations by the use of other data sources. For example,\nthe Current Population Survey, which is designed to provide\ncharacteristics of the labor force, occasionally uses supplements\nthat involve health issues. An example is given by the Tobacco\nUse Supplement that was added to 3 months of the Current\n(89). (The Current Population Survey samples approximately\n60000 households in the United States each month, which is\nmuch larger than nearly all health surveys.) As mentioned pre-\nviously, an additional data source is information on vital statis-\ntics or other records that are kept on all individuals. If the re-\nsearch question can be answered with these resources, then the\nproblem of small numbers can be avoided.\nThe availability of public-use data files from health surveys\nand commercial software for performing survey analyses makes\nit easy for investigators to address their research questions by\nuse of survey data. However, the ability to analyze survey data\nshould not lead one to ignore the principles of good scientific\nmethod. In particular, given the large numbers of variables re-\ncorded in a typical survey, it is easy to examine a multitude of\npossible associations and discover some spurious ones. In addi-\ntion, except in the situation of randomized assignment of an\nintervention (e.g., COMMIT described above), associations\nfound between risk factors and outcomes could theoretically\nalways be due to confounding variables and not be of a causal\nnature. Finally, as is well known, statistical significance is not\nthe same as scientific importance. With large sample sizes of\nsome surveys, it is possible that an association between two\nvariables can be small, yet still be statistically significant (e.g.,\nP<.05). Presentation of confidence intervals with estimates can\nhelp avoid misinterpretations. With these caveats in mind, we\nbelieve that there is tremendous potential in using health surveys\nas a resource of addressing cancer-related objectives.\nAPPENDIX\nU.S. Government-sponsored surveys that collect health\ninformation that have public-use data files (with years\nof surveys)\nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research (http://www.ahcpr.gov):\nNational Medical Care Expenditure Survey (1977)\nNational Medical Expenditure Survey (1987)\nBureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov):\nBureau of the Census (http://www.census.gov):\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov):\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1984\u00ad)\nYouth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (1990\u00ad)\nDepartment of Agriculture (http://www.usda.gov):\nNationwide Food Consumption Survey (periodic, starting in 1936)\nHealth Care Financing Administration (http://www.hcfa.gov):\nMedicare Current Beneficiary Survey (1991\u00ad, with follow-up)\nNational Center for Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww):\nNational Health Interview Survey (1957\u00ad, with Longitudinal Study\nof Aging)\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (periodic, start-\ning in 1971, with follow-up of NHANES I)\nNational Home and Hospice Care Survey (1992\u00ad)\nNational Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1992\u00ad)\nNational Hospital Discharge Survey (1965\u00ad)\nNational Maternal and Infant Health Survey (1988, with follow-up)\nNational Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (1980)\nNational Mortality Followback Survey (periodic, starting in 1961)\nNational Nursing Home Survey (periodic, starting in 1973)\nNational Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (1994\u00ad)\nNational Survey of Family Growth (periodic, starting in 1973)\nNational Survey of Personal Health Practices and Consequences\nNational Institute on Aging/Center for Demographic Studies, Duke\nUniversity (http://cds.duke.edu):\nfollow-up)\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (http://\nwww.niaaa.nih.gov):\nNational Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (1992)\nNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (http://\nwww.nidr.nih.gov):\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (http://www.nida.nih.gov):\nMonitoring the Future Study (1975\u00ad, with follow-up)\nNational Institute for Mental Health/Department of Health Care Policy,\nHarvard Medical School (http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu):\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (http://\nwww.samhsa.gov):\nNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse (1971\u00ad)\nREFERENCES\n(1) Brett KM, Madans JH.
