There\nseems to be no end to the literature dealing with the chal-\nlenges of meeting the income, health care, and caregiving\nneeds of the burgeoning population of older people. Al-\nthough less discussed, population aging also is likely to\nhave significant implications for children and their well-\nbeing. In this article, I begin to explore how changes in the\nsize and composition of the older population between 2010\nand 2030 in the United States may be connected to the ex-\nperience of children.\nThe article is divided into five parts. The first two sec-\ntions provide a necessary background for examining the\nimplications of population aging for children over the next\nseveral decades. First, a demographic perspective on chang-\ning age distributions is provided. As the proportion of the\nover the two decades following 2010, how will the propor-\ntion under age 20 change? The second section draws atten-\ntion to the large and growing inequality among children in\nthe United States: the gap between most privileged and least\nprivileged children. The implications of population aging\nfor children are not uniform across these different segments\nof the child population. The remainder of the article consid-\ners three possible ways in which population aging could be\nconnected to the experience of children. These connections\ninvolve state resources available for investment in children,\ngrandparent resources available to children, and involve-\nment of older people in directly meeting needs of children\nnot related to them by kinship.\nDemography of Age Composition\nThe long-term change in population age distribution as a\nsociety experiences the demographic transition is quite\nstraightforward. When a population has sustained high fer-\ntility and high mortality for a long period of time, it will\nhave a large proportion of children and a small proportion\nof old people. Correspondingly, when a population has sus-\ntained low fertility and low mortality for a long period of\ntime, it will have a much smaller proportion of children and\na much larger proportion of old people. Using stable popu-\nlation models, the magnitude of this shift in age composi-\ntion can be seen. (A stable population shows the age\ndistribution that would ultimately result if age-specific re-\nproduction and mortality rates were unchanging over time.\nIt can be determined by specifying life expectancy and the\ngross reproduction rate [GRR], which is the average num-\nber of daughters that women would have by the end of their\nreproductive careers if, at each age, they experienced the\nfertility rates of a particular period. The statistics that follow\nare from the stable female population data available in Coale\n& Demeny, 1983.)

This article explores ways in which population aging in the United States between 2010 and 2030 might\nimpact the well-being of children, with a distinction made between advantaged and disadvantaged children.\nMethods. A variety of economic and demographic statistics are used to describe the changing age structure of the\npopulation and changing public spending on older people and children. Data from the 1985 General Social Survey and\nWave 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households are also used to examine connections between older people\nand children.\nResults. In recent decades, there has been a graying of the federal budget, and programs for children have received a\ndeclining proportion of domestic spending. These trends will be exaggerated between 2010 and 2030 unless structural\nchanges occur. Grandparents may provide increasing resources for their grandchildren. Age segregation results in rela-\ntively few older people being directly involved with children not related to them by kinship.\nConclusions. The implications of population aging for children are relevant primarily for disadvantaged children.\nDisadvantaged children have grandparents with fewest resources and are most in need of public spending. As costs of\nsupporting the older population increase, intentional social changes will be needed to prevent growing inequality among\nchildren.\nKey Words: Age segregation--Child well-being--Grandparents--Population aging--Welfare state.\nUHLENBERG\nand a GRR of 1.0), 25% of the population is younger than\nshift in the relative size of the older and younger popula-\ntions is primarily a consequence of changing fertility rates\n(Goldstein, 2009). Note that the change in the relative size\nto 55%) is much less than the decrease in proportion young\n(22%) or the increase in proportion old (16%).\nAlthough the long-term effect of a rapid drop in fertility\nis a decrease in percent of children that approximately\nequals the increase in percent old, the timing is different\nfor shifts in relative sizes of these two age categories. Most\nof the decline in the proportion young in the population\noccurs within the first two decades following a fertility de-\ncline, whereas most of the change in percent old is not\nexperienced until several decades later. Thus, for several\ndecades after fertility drops, the youth dependency ratio\nany significant increase in the old age dependency ratio\nthis phase a decline occurs in the total dependency ratio\n(youth dependency ratio plus old age dependency ratio).\nOther things being equal, this temporary drop in the total\ndependency ratio, referred to as a \"demographic dividend,\"\nallows more resources to be invested rather than con-\nsumed. Later, however, as the old age dependency ratio\nincreases, the total dependency ratio returns to a level sim-\nilar to the one existing before the fertility decline. Those\nwho question whether population aging creates any eco-\nnomic challenge to a society often call attention to the fact\nthat total dependency ratios may be no higher in an old\npopulation than in a young one. The higher old age depen-\ndency ratio in the old population is offset by a lower youth\ndependency ratio.\nOf course the U.S. population was not stable in 1970,\nnor has it been stable since then. However, because fertil-\nity essentially leveled off after falling sharply in the 1960s,\nthe general dynamics of changing age distributions fol-\nlowing a drop in fertility previously described help us to\nunderstand changes in the age composition of the U.S.\n(TFR) in the United States dropped abruptly after the baby\nCenter for Health Statistics [NCHS], 2008), and then it\nremained relatively stable thereafter. (The TFR indicates\nthe average number of children that women who survive to\nthe end of their reproductive careers would have if they\nexperienced, at each age, the fertility rate existing at a par-\nticular period.) Figure 1 shows how the age distribution of\nthe U.S. population changed in the years following the\nrapid fertility decline that occurred in the 1960s. Between\nwhereas the proportion aged 65 and older increased by\nover these two decades, the proportion younger than 20\nAs a result of these changes, the total dependency ratio,\nby 2030. The demographic dividend resulting from the\nfertility decline of the 1960s will essentially be eliminated\nas the population ages rapidly.\nIncreasing Inequality Among Children\nAs fertility declined in the 1960s, American families on\naverage had fewer children. But other large changes in the\nfamily also occurred after the 1960s, and these changes\nhave significant implications for children. Two widely rec-\nognized changes were the increasing proportion of children\nborn to unmarried mothers and the increasing proportion of\nchildren experiencing the divorce of their parents. The pro-\nportion of children born to unmarried mothers steadily in-\nchildren experiencing their parents' divorce increased rap-\n(Clarke, 1995) but probably has not increased since then.\n(National data on the number of children experiencing their\nparents' divorce are not available after 1990, but divorce\nrates have not increased since that date.) As a result of these\nchanges, the proportion of children living with two parents\nagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2008). This\nchange in family structure significantly increased the pro-\nportion of children at risk of living in families with limited\nresources. Risk of economic deprivation is much greater for\nchildren in one-parent families--poverty rates for children\n8% for those living with two married parents (Federal Inter-\nagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2008). In ad-\ndition, parental time investment in the care and supervision\nof children tends to be less in one-parent families compared\nwith two-parent families (McLanahan & Percheski, 2008).\nIn an insightful article, McLanahan (2004) extends our\nunderstanding of the growing disparity in children's re-\nsources by focusing on differing education levels of mothers.\nPart of the growing inequality related to mother's education\nis a result of the different trends in premarital childbearing\nand divorce among women with differing educational\nbackgrounds. A recent study of children born in two dif-\ndivergence in family structure experienced by those born\nto well-educated mothers versus low-educated mothers\n(Martin, 2004).

In contrast, the proportion of children born\nto non-college-educated mothers who were married and\nremained married for 10 years declined from 53% to\nBut other changes related to mother's education are also\nrelevant to the growing gap between most privileged and\nleast privileged children. Because of increasing educational\nattainment of women (DiPrete & Buchmann, 2006), in-\ncreasing marital homogamy (Schwartz & Mare, 2005), and\nincreasing employment of mothers (McLanahan, 2004), a\ngrowing proportion of children since 1970 have lived in\nfamilies with well-educated mothers, few siblings, and high\nincomes resulting from two parents working at high-paying\njobs. Meanwhile, children born to low-educated mothers\nhave made little progress, as they are likely to live either in\ntwo-parent families where neither parent has a high-paying\njob or, increasingly, in single-parent families with low in-\ncome. The actual increasing economic disparity of children\nover time can be seen from statistics in the Federal Inter-\nagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics (2008), which\nproportion of children living in families below the poverty\nwealthy families (defined as family income more than 600%\nCorrespondingly, the proportion of children in medium-\nThus, an increasing proportion of children experience the\nmultiple advantages of growing up in stable families with\ntwo highly educated parents and very high incomes. In con-\ntrast is the large proportion of children who grow up with\nthe multiple disadvantages of living in poverty with a single\nlow-educated parent. The significance of this growing divi-\nsion of children between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\"\nshould not be underestimated. The discussion that follows\nexamines how the changes in the older population between\nand least privileged children in the United States and thereby\nfurther exacerbate the growing divide among children.\nPopulation Aging, Children, and the Welfare\nState\nA first possible connection between population aging and\nthe well-being of children relates to the increasing cost to\nthe welfare state of supporting a growing dependent older\npopulation. The costs of supporting an increasing number\nof older people could challenge efforts to increase, or even\nmaintain, the level of state resources that are invested in\nchildren (in things like child care, income security, social\nservices, education, and health care). Focusing on how the\ndomestic spending portion of the federal budget (the budget\nminus defense, homeland security, and international affairs)\nis allocated provides evidence of how various programs\ncompeting for domestic priority have fared recently. Be-\nbudget grew rapidly, both in absolute size and as a percent\nof gross domestic product, as government programs pro-\nliferated. As previously noted, this expansion of govern-\nment spending was aided by the demographic dividend\nprovided by the rapid drop in fertility. During this period,\nspending on children's programs grew but at a slower pace\nthan total domestic spending and at a far slower pace than\nspending on programs for the older population. Conse-\nquently, the three largest programs for older people (non-\nchild parts of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid)\n2006 (Carasso, Steuerle, Reynolds, Vericker, & Macomber,\n2008). In contrast, all federal spending on children declined\nIf current arrangements persist, projections of federal\nspending to the year 2018 suggest that the declining priority\nof children in the federal budget will continue. These pro-\njections show that by 2018, programs for children will be\njust 13.8% of the domestic budget, whereas the portion go-\ning to older adults will increase to 59.2% (Carasso et al.,\n2008). And, of course, the proportion committed to older\nadults would then continue to increase over the following\ndecade as the proportion old in the population continues to\nincrease rapidly until 2030. The relevance of the impressive\ngrowth in spending on the older population compared with\nthat on children is simply that as an increasing proportion of\npublic spending goes to older people, a decreasing propor-\ntion is available for all other programs. Recognizing the\nchallenges created by the graying of the federal budget for\nfunding children's programs does not, of course, mean that\nolder people are receiving too much or that children must\nreceive too little.\nUHLENBERG\nIn a provocative article, Preston (1984) noted that whereas\npoverty rates for older Americans declined rapidly between\nstantially. These divergent trends in poverty occurred as\ngovernment spending on older people grew much more rap-\nidly than spending on children. This finding led to an argu-\nment that programs for the old were growing at the expense\nof programs for the young. Other economists (Kotlikoff,\ntions of the expanding claims of the older population on the\nfederal budget. The suggestion of a growing competition\nbetween young and old for public support generated a\nheated political debate over \"generational equity.\" Is the in-\ncreased spending on the older population that accompanies\npopulation aging creating conflict between age groups?And\nis conflict between age groups for scarce resources likely to\nescalate as baby boom cohorts enter old age? A number of\nsocial scientists have effectively responded to these ques-\ntions by arguing that political conflict between age groups\nhas not developed and is unlikely to develop in the future\nKingson, 1999). Further, the literature that is critical of the\ngenerational equity hypothesis points out that increasing\nspending on the old does not require less spending on chil-\ndren. Indeed, an international comparison of different de-\nveloped countries found that high levels of public spending\non older people was positively associated with high levels\nof spending on children (Pampel, 1994). Thus, it does not ap-\npear that generational conflict is a necessary consequence of\npopulation aging.\nNevertheless, it is clear that social spending has devel-\noped in such a way that the gap in government spending on\nolder people and children is now huge, and this gap is con-\ntinuing to increase. The Congressional Budget Office (2008)\nestimates that average federal spending per person older\ncompared with $3,000 per child. If spending from all levels\nof government, rather than just the federal level, is consid-\nered, the ratio of per capita spending on older people com-\npared with children is reduced, but only from 7:1 to about\npoint is that the discrepancy in per capita public spending\non children and old people in the United States cannot\nbe ignored when considering the shifting budget priorities\nrelated to population aging. The aging of the population be-\nspending on the entitlement programs for older people.\nOver these 20 years, there is no reason to expect that needs\nof children will decrease--the proportion of the population\nwho are children will decline by less than 1%. Potentially\ntaxes could increase, or other shifts in the budget could oc-\ncur that would permit increasing spending on children at the\nsame time that spending on older people is increasing. But\nthe emerging political challenges of balancing competing\ndemands for the shrinking proportion of the domestic bud-\nget not going to support old age programs should not be\nignored.\nAs previously noted, the demographic dividend created\nby the decline in birth rates in the 1960s is ending, and the\nBecause all the increase in the dependency ratio is created\nby the growing old age dependency ratio, the economic sig-\nnificance of the demographic change is amplified.\nActually, dependency ratios that use simple age composi-\ntion statistics are not the best way to measure support avail-\nable to dependents in a population because labor force\nparticipation rates of the adult population can change.\nRather, it is preferable to look directly at the ratio of people\nin the labor force to the size of the child and older popula-\ntion. Using projections of the labor force and population,\ndata in Table 1 indicate changes in the ratio of workers to\nchildren and old people in coming decades. As is well\nknown, the number of people in the labor force per person\nnumber in the labor force per person younger than 20 years\nalso declines--from 1.9 to 1.7. Consequently, looking\nahead, the growing burden on the working population to\nsupport an aging population will not be mitigated by any\ndecline in the burden to support children.\nIn the United States, parents are expected to be the pri-\nmary source of support for children and there is widespread\nopposition to the idea of societal responsibility for bearing\nthe cost of childrearing. That is the reason why per capita\ngovernment spending on children is relatively low compared\nwith spending on older people. Compared with other welfare\nstates, collective responsibility for the cost of raising chil-\ndren in the United States is quite limited (Lundberg, Aberg,\nKolegard, Bjork, & Fritzell, 2008; Osberg, Smeeding, &\nSchwabish, 2004). Thus, in the United States the abundance\nenjoyed by children in privileged families stands in contrast\nto children in the least privileged families who rely primar-\nily on the resources of their economically disadvantaged\nand stressed parents. Thus, if there is a declining priority for\nchildren's programs in public spending, the impact will be\nexperienced precisely by those children who are most vul-\nnerable and dependent on public support. Although the\ngrowing cost of supporting the older population in coming\ndecades does not require declining public support for poor\nTable 1. Ratio of Population in the Labor Force (LF) to Population\nNote: Sources--U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division (2008) and\nchildren, the political implications of a graying federal bud-\nget raises concerns. Almost certainly, this change in the\nbudget will increase the political challenge of adequately\nresponding to the needs of disadvantaged children.\nGrandparents' Contribution to Grandchildren\nThe negative implications of the graying federal budget\nfor the well-being of children should be balanced by assess-\ning the potential for increasing positive direct contributions\nfrom older people to children. The clearest way in which\nolder people directly contribute to the well-being of chil-\ndren operates through kinship ties, and these are considered\nfirst. Changes in fertility and mortality that are responsible\nfor population aging have affected opportunities for grand-\nparents to play a significant role in the lives of children.\nMortality declines have the obvious effect of increasing the\nsupply of living grandparents for children. I have estimated\nthat under mortality conditions existing in 1960, only about\n23% of children aged 10 would have all four biological\ngrandparents still living (Uhlenberg, 2005). As death rates\nin later life have declined, the number of living grandpar-\nents for children has increased, and by 2020 almost half of\nall 10-year-olds are expected to have all grandparents alive.\nIndeed, we anticipate that 80% of those reaching age 30 in\n2020 will still have at least one living grandparent.\nThe decline in fertility that leads to population aging also\nincreases opportunities for living grandparents to make\nlarge investments in their grandchildren. As family size de-\ncreases, children have fewer siblings who compete for the\nattention and resources of their grandparents. About 60% of\nthe children born to baby boom families in the 1950s had\nthree or more siblings: Only 30% of the children born after\nWhen low fertility persists over several generations, there is\nan additional reduction in competition for grandparents.\nChildren born to parents who have few siblings have few\nsets of cousins who share the same grandparents. The pro-\nportion of children who have four or more sets of cousins\ncompeting for the attention of a particular grandparent is\ndren per grandparent will continue as the baby boom co-\nhorts enter old age; by 2020, a majority of children will\nhave no more than one set of cousins linked to a particular\ngrandparent and only 20% of grandparents will have more\nthan two sets of grandchildren.\nThere are other obvious ways in which grandparents' re-\nsources have increased since 1960, and these are likely to\ncontinue to increase in coming decades as the proportion\nold in the population increases. Not only do children have\nmore grandparents alive but also their grandparents are\nwealthier and healthier than in the past. The trend toward\nincreasing economic resources of people approaching old\nage is expected to continue as baby boomers retire (Butrica,\nIams, & Smith, 2004). Similarly, the trend toward lower dis-\nability rates among the young-old population is expected to\ncontinue (Manton, Gu, & Lamb, 2006). Further, most grand-\nparents older than 65 years are now retired, giving them\ntime to spend with grandchildren. Despite increasing rates\nof labor force participation by the older population in recent\nyears, less than one-third of those aged 65\u00ad69 years were in\nperspective of children in general, there has been an increas-\ning likelihood of having multiple grandparents who have\nvaluable resources (money, health, time). And children have\nfewer siblings and cousins with whom they share these\ngrandparents. These patterns suggest that population aging\ndirect contributions of older people to their grandchildren.\nHowever, this happy scenario of increasing opportunities\nfor grandparents to invest in the lives of children is not real-\nized by many children because the opportunities are spread\nunevenly. As discussed earlier, there is a growing disparity\nbetween most advantaged and least advantaged children.\nBecause the connection between children and grandparents\ntends to be mediated by the middle generation, it is children\nin the most advantaged families who gain most from the\nincreasing resources of older people. Children in single-\nparent families and those with less educated mothers are\nmuch less likely than children living in more advantaged\nfamilies to have multiple grandparents with resources to\nmake significant intergenerational contributions. This does\nnot mean, of course, that grandparents with limited re-\nsources do not make important contributions to their\ngrandchildren (Minkler & Fuller-Thomson, 2005). Indeed,\nolder women in poorer health are more likely than other\nwomen to become custodial grandparents (Hughes, Waite,\nLaPierre, & Luo, 2007). But the point is that disadvantaged\nchildren are disproportionately linked to grandparents who\nare relatively disadvantaged.\nThe extent of inequality of grandparent resources for ad-\nvantaged compared with disadvantaged children can be\nseen from data collected by the National Survey of Families\nand Households (see http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/nsfh/). Sta-\ntistics in Table 2 show maternal grandparent characteristics\nfor most advantaged children (living with two married par-\nents, mother with a college education, and household in-\ncome in the upper quartile) compared with least advantaged\nchildren (living with one parent, mother with less than a\ncollege education, and household income in the lowest\nquartile). The same proportion of all children (12%) was in\nthe least advantaged as in the most advantaged category.\nCompared with the most advantaged children, the least ad-\nvantaged were twice as likely to have maternal grandparents\nwho had economic concerns, were in poor health, or had 10\nor more grandchildren (Table 2). Further, grandparents of\ndisadvantaged children were much more likely to have\nlimited education and to be unmarried. The most advan-\ntaged children tend to have access to abundant grandparent\nUHLENBERG\nresources, which are somewhat \"socially redundant\"\nbecause these children already have generous family re-\nsources (Elder & Conger, 2000). In contrast, the least ad-\nvantaged children have access to severely limited\ngrandparent resources. Because children with the greatest\nneed are linked to grandparents who are most likely to be\ndivorced and to have poor health, low education, and low\nincome, they are likely to benefit little if at all from the an-\nticipated overall increase in resources of grandparents in\ncoming decades.\nOlder People's Involvement With Nonkin\nChildren\nAlthough the primary way in which older people directly\ncontribute to the well-being of children is through the grand-\nparent\u00adgrandchild connection, it also is possible for older\npeople to assist children who are not their kin. Through in-\nvolvement in volunteer programs, older people have the po-\ntential to improve the welfare of children and to improve\ntheir own well-being (Morrow-Howell, Hinterlong, Rozario,\n& Tang, 2003). For example, evaluations of the Foster\nGrandparent Program, which matches people older than\n60 years with disadvantaged children, report positive out-\ncomes for the children involved (Senior Corps, 2008). But\nthis program involves only about 1 in 1,500 older adults. A\nvariety of other intergenerational programs have been found\nto benefit both older people and needy children, but there is\nno evidence that these volunteer programs involve more than\na tiny fraction of older adults (Newman, Ward, Smith,\nWilson, & McCrea, 1997). We lack detailed data showing\nhow many older people interact with children not related to\nthem by kinship, how much time they spend with nonkin\nchildren, what the interaction involves, and what difference\nit makes to children and to old people. However, there is\nevidence of pervasive age segregation in American society\n(Hagestad & Uhlenberg, 2005), suggesting that overall there\nis little interaction between children and nonkin older people.\nOne indication of the extent of age segregation in the\nUnited States comes from analyzing data collected in the\n1985 General Social Survey that asked adult respondents to\nidentify up to five other adults with whom they had dis-\ncussed important matters over the past 6 months (see Burt,\n1985). I have calculated the age distribution of the individu-\nals identified as nonkin members of the personal networks\nfor individuals of different ages. The extent of age segrega-\ntion of nonkin network members is shown by data in Table 3.\nFor every age category, the largest proportion of network\nmembers is in the same age category occupied by the re-\nspondent (indicated by the percents in the diagonal). Fewer\nthan 2% of the nonkin network members of persons aged\n30 years selected anyone older than 70 years as a network\nmember.) Reciprocally, fewer than 7% of the network mem-\nbers selected by respondents older than 60 years were\nyounger than 40 years. (And no one older than 70 years\nidentified anyone younger than 30 years as a network mem-\nber). Although this survey asked respondents to identify\nonly adult members of their personal networks, it seems un-\nlikely that older people would have identified any nonkin\nchildren if that had been permitted.\nAdditional evidence of age segregation of children\nfrom nonkin old people is seen from the age composition\nof the adults involved with children in the dominant non-\nfamily settings. Only 3% of all teachers of children in\nkindergarten through eighth grade are older than 60\nyears, and only 3% of day care workers are older than 65\nyears (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2005).\nSimilarly, older people are rarely the coaches of recre-\nation league sports teams, the counselors at children's\ncamps, or the pediatricians or dentists that children see.\nIf they thought about it, children, as they go about their\ndaily activities, might well ask, \"Where are the old peo-\nple?\" But children are not likely to ask this question be-\ncause it is so taken for granted that our social institutions\ndesigned to care for children largely exclude older peo-\nple. As older people comprise an increasing proportion\nof the adult population in coming decades, it is possible\nthat the average amount of time that children spend inter-\nacting with older nonkin could increase. But the starting\nlevel of interaction is so small that any plausible increase\nin older people caring for nonkin children would be too\nsmall to make a noticeable difference in the lives of\ndisadvantaged children. It would require large structural\nTable 2.

However, because age is a central organizing fac-\ntor in social structure, the changing age composition of the\npopulation has potential implications for children. Under-\nstanding what these implications of population aging are is\na first step toward thinking about what social changes could\nprotect or enhance the well-being of children. Because of\nthe central role that families play in the lives of children,\nthere is little reason to expect that population aging would\nhave any adverse consequences for children in families with\ntwo well-educated parents. Indeed, the changing older popu-\nlation could bring advantages to these children because they\nare increasingly connected to grandparents with significant\namounts of social and economic capital. Therefore, it is\nmost important to focus on implications of population aging\nfor the more disadvantaged children in the population.\nA significant proportion of American children are grow-\ning up in disadvantaged families. A majority of children\nhave mothers who are not college graduates, 17% are living\nin poverty, and 33% are living in single-parent families.\nChildren who have the least parental resources potentially\nhave the most to gain from involvement with grandparents,\nbut they are the least likely to have grandparents with sig-\nnificant resources. Disadvantaged children have the most to\ngain from involvement with resourceful older nonkin, but\nage segregation means that few older people are involved in\nsuch helping relationships. Disadvantaged children are most\ndependent on public spending that could compensate for\ntheir weak parental resources, but children are a decreasing\npriority in public spending. Unless priorities in public\nspending change, funding for children's programs will be\nchallenged by the growing cost of programs for older people\nThe growing divide between advantaged and disadvan-\ntaged children in an aging American society is not inevita-\nble. It would be possible for the welfare state to redistribute\nmore resources to disadvantaged children. This would re-\nquire either further expanding the size of the domestic bud-\nget or reordering priorities in the budget. Either option is\nsure to face political opposition, so changes that favor dis-\nadvantaged children are unlikely to occur without organized\nefforts. It would be possible to better support grandparents\nwho care for disadvantaged children (Baker & Silverstein,\n2008). It would be possible to encourage resourceful older\npeople to be more involved in mentoring and caring for dis-\nadvantaged children other than their own grandchildren.\nThis could be accomplished by expanding intergenerational\nprograms, which have the potential to benefit both old and\nyoung. Ways to expand involvement of older people with\nnonkin children could include expanding incentives for\nolder people to become engaged, increasing awareness of\nopportunities for and benefits of engagement, increasing re-\ncruitment efforts to get older people to participate, and in-\ncreasing financial support for intergenerational programs.\nAll the changes discussed here to protect vulnerable chil-\ndren are more likely to occur if critical attention is given to\nimplications of population aging for children, and to the\nway in which later life is socially structured. It should also\nbe noted that failing to adequately invest in children now\nwill complicate the challenge of meeting needs of the older\npopulation in the future. Investments in children pay divi-\ndends of increased economic productivity when these chil-\ndren enter adulthood (Esping-Andersen, 2008).\n"
