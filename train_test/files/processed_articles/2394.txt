    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Massachusetts continues to move forward on comprehensive health reform.\nUninsurance is at historically low levels, despite the recent economic downturn. Building on\nthat coverage expansion, access to and affordability of care in the commonwealth have im-\nproved. Notwithstanding these successes, some of the early gains in reducing barriers to\ncare and improving the affordability of care had eroded by fall 2008, reflecting trends that\npredate health reform in Massachusetts: constraints on provider capacity and increasing\nhealth care costs. Because these are national concerns as well, Massachusetts continues\nHealth reform remains a top priority on the national agenda,\nwith many proposals drawing on Massachusetts' 2006 health reform leg-\nislation. That initiative, with its goals of near-universal health insurance\ncoverage and improved access to affordable, high-quality health care, includes\nshared individual, employer, and government responsibilities. Key elements in-\nclude Medicaid expansions (called MassHealth), subsidized private insurance\ncoverage (called Commonwealth Care, or CommCare), a new purchasing pool\n(called Commonwealth Choice, or CommChoice), required actions for employers,\nand an individual mandate.1 By summer 2008 the uninsurance rate among all resi-\ndents in Massachusetts was estimated to be down to 2.6 percent.2\nAlthough much is known about the initial impacts of reform in Massachusetts,\nthe initiative continues to evolve.3 Some key components have been put in place\nonly recently, and others have been modified over time.4 Drawing lessons from\nMassachusetts' experiences requires examining its reform initiative over time.\nThis paper provides an update as of fall 2008 on health reform in Massachusetts\nas it affected working-age adults--the primary target population of the reform\nH e a l t h R e f o r m\nSharonLong(slong@urban.org)isaseniorfellowattheUrbanInstituteinWashington,D.C.PaulMasiisa\nresearchassociatethere.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The high levels of insurance coverage in the state have been documented\nelsewhere.5 The focus here is on the impacts of health reform on access to and\naffordability of care for residents of the state.\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data. The study used three rounds of interviews with adults ages 18\u00ad64, con-\nducted in fall 2006 (N = 3,010), just prior to the implementation of many of the key\nscribed elsewhere, collected information on insurance status, access to care, out-of-\npocket health spending, medical debt, and more general financial problems.6\nn Methods. Determining the effect of health reform in Massachusetts requires\ncomparing the outcomes under reform (for example, access to care) to the outcomes\nthat would have occurred in the absence of reform. This study compares the out-\ncomes for a cross-sectional sample of adults in periods following the implementa-\nsectional sample of adults in fall 2006.7 Under this pre-post framework, differences\nbetween the pre- and post-implementation periods are attributed to the state's re-\nform efforts. An important limitation of this model is that other changes over the\ntime period that also affected the outcomes of interest will be captured in the\nestimates, confounding the estimates of the reform's impacts.\nSurvey (CPS) found that earlier pre-post estimates of the impacts of health reform\nwere not affected by such confounding factors.8 However, economic trends may be\nmore of an issue here, because the Massachusetts economy had slowed by fall\n2008: the share of working-age adults employed in October (the first month of the\n62.6 percent in 2008.9 Thus, the estimates reported here likely reflect the effects of\nboth health reform and the early phase of the recent economic downturn.10 Unfor-\ntunately, the analyses needed to disentangle the effects of health reform from those\nof the recession require data that will not be available until late 2009 and 2010.\nAn economic downturn would be expected to lead to a drop in health insurance\ncoverage (as unemployment increased and people lost employer-sponsored cover-\nage) and, as a result, poorer access to health care, all else equal.11 In fall 2008 there\nwas no evidence of a decline in insurance coverage in the state. Thus, any early ef-\nfects of the recession were not large enough to offset the gains in coverage that had\nbeen achieved under health reform.\nWe report estimates based on multivariate regression models that control for\ncharacteristics of individuals and their family members and for characteristics of\nthe local health care market and economy in each year. The analysis sample was\nlimited to observations with complete data for the regression models; 3.1 percent\nof the cases were dropped because of missing data for one or more explanatory\nvariables. Because the outcome measures we examined were binary variables (for\nM a s s a c h u s e t t s U p d a t e\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 5 7 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In presenting findings, we report the regression-adjusted impact esti-\nmates in the text (these estimates are different from simple differences calculated\nby subtraction); both unadjusted estimates (simple differences) and regression-\nadjusted estimates are reported in appendix exhibits online.12\nStudy Findings\nn Access to and use of health care. Consistent with the sustained increase in\ncoverage in Massachusetts, there also have been sustained improvements in access\nto care (Exhibit 1).13 Under health reform, working-age adults (ages 18\u00ad64) in Mas-\nsachusetts were more likely than before to report that they had a usual place to go\nwhen sick or in need of advice about their health, a measure of continuity of health\nadjusted estimates; see Appendix Exhibit 1]). They were also more likely than before\nto have had doctor visits in the past twelve months: the likelihood of having any doc-\ntor visit rose 5.7 percentage points and multiple doctor visits, 5.1 percentage points.\nSimilarly, the likelihood of having a preventive care visit (up 6.5 percentage points)\nand a dental care visit (up 7.8 percentage points) rose by fall 2008.\nAlthough there were gains in health care use in the first year (between fall 2006\nand fall 2007), many of the gains in doctor visits occurred in the second year (be-\ninsurance coverage. During the second period, there were significant increases in\nthe likelihood of any doctor visit in the past twelve months (up 4.6 percentage\npoints) and multiple doctor visits (up 6.5 percentage points).\nThe gains in access under health reform were strongest for lower-income adults\n(those with family incomes less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level);\nhowever, higher-income adults were also more likely to report doctor visits in the\npast twelve months (up 5.3 percentage points) and visits for preventive care (up\nThese estimates are for all adults in Massachusetts, not just those who gained\ncoverage under health reform. Although we would expect most of the gains in ac-\ncess to have been among those who obtained coverage, gains in access were also\nreported by those who were continuously insured during the year, which suggests\nthat the improvements in access to care reflect both gains from having coverage\nand improvements in existing insurance coverage under health reform (data not\nshown). Further, the improvements in existing coverage affected both those with\npublic coverage (who reported gains in dental care use--consistent with the ex-\npansion of dental coverage under MassHealth) and those with private coverage\n(who reported gains in the use of preventive care--consistent with the require-\nment that preventive care visits be covered without a deductible under the \"mini-\nmum creditable coverage\" standards; data not shown).\nH e a l t h R e f o r m\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Paradoxically, the increases in health care use from fall 2007\nto fall 2008 were coupled with indications that some adults were having more diffi-\nculty obtaining care in fall 2008 than in fall 2007. The shares of adults who reported\nthat they did not get care that they thought they needed in the past twelve months\ntended to increase between fall 2007 and fall 2008, after having declined between\nnificant for only a few types of care (specialist care and medical tests, treatment, or\nM a s s a c h u s e t t s U p d a t e\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 5 8 1\nAccess To And Use Of Health Care Under Health Reform In Massachusetts For Adults\nHas a usual source of care (excluding ED)\nAny doctor visit in past 12 months\nPreventive care\nMultiple visits\nAny visit to a specialist in past 12 months\nAny dental care visit in past 12 months\nTook any Rx drugs in past 12 months\nDid not get needed care for any reason in past 12 months\nDoctor care\nSpecialist care\nMedical tests, treatment, follow-up care\nPreventive care screening\nRx drugs\nDental care\nAny ED visits in past 12 months\nMost recent ED visit was for nonemergencya\nHas a usual source of care (excluding ED)\nAny doctor visit in past 12 months\nPreventive care\nMultiple visits\nAny visit to a specialist in past 12 months\nAny dental care visit in past 12 months\nTook any Rx drugs in past 12 months\nDid not get needed care for any reason in past 12 months\nDoctor care\nSpecialist care\nMedical tests, treatment, follow-up care\nPreventive care screening\nRx drugs\nDental care\nAny ED visits in past 12 months\nMost recent ED visit was for nonemergencya\nNOTES: See Appendix Exhibit 1 for information on the regression model (available online at http://content.healthaffairs.org/\na A condition that the respondent thought could have been treated by a regular doctor if one had been available.\n* (**) (***) Regression-adjusted estimate of difference from fall 2006 was significantly different from zero at the 0.10 (0.05)\n(0.01) level, two-tailed test.\n# (##) Regression-adjusted estimate of difference from fall 2007 was significantly different from zero at the 0.10 (0.05) level,\ntwo-tailed test.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

By fall 2008, the reductions in unmet need under health reform\nwere limited to lower levels of unmet need for doctor care, preventive care screening,\nand prescription drugs; unmet need for other care had moved closer to pre-reform\nlevels.\nthe simultaneous increases in use and unmet need for some types of care) may re-\nflect several factors, including attempts by newly insured adults to obtain care for\nthe first time, attempts by adults with newly covered benefits to access those ben-\nefits, and, as a result of both of those factors, increased demand for follow-up care\nbased on initial visits. To the extent that these factors are driving the increased de-\nmand, there would be greater stress on the supply of providers in the early period\nunder health reform, as more people sought and used health care in a short period\nof time. However, under a system in which people have continuous coverage (as is\nmore likely in Massachusetts under health reform), we would expect ongoing de-\nmand for care to stabilize between the lower levels of the pre-reform period and\nthe higher levels of this transition period.\nsurvey asked about problems trying to obtain health care during the past twelve\nmonths (Exhibit 2). About one in five adults in Massachusetts reported that they\nwere told that a doctor's office or clinic was not accepting patients with their type\nof coverage or was not accepting any new patients. These problems were reported\nfor both primary and specialty care (67 percent and 43 percent of those reporting\nsuch problems, respectively; data not shown).\nDifficulties finding a provider were much more common for lower-income than\nhigher-income adults (29 percent/15 percent) and for adults with public and other\nH e a l t h R e f o r m\nPercentage Of Adults Ages 18\u00ad64 In Massachusetts Reporting Difficulty Obtaining\nCare Because Provider Was Not Accepting Patients, 2008\nSOURCE: Massachusetts Health Reform Survey, 2008.\nPercent reporting\nAll adults\nNot accepting new patients\nNot accepting patients\nwith insurance type\nPublic or other coverage\nPrivate coverage\nFamily income <300% of poverty\nFamily income 300% of poverty or more\nNot accepting patients\nfor either reason\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Adults with\npublic and other coverage were much more likely than those with private coverage\nto be told that the provider was not taking their type of insurance (25 percent/7\npercent) and to face closed panels (24 percent/12 percent).\nThese differences likely reflect multiple factors, including lower provider reim-\nbursement rates under the public programs and access to a limited set of providers\nunder the four health plans that were serving public enrollees during this period.\nThe constraints imposed by the latter were likely exacerbated by the rapid in-\ncrease in coverage under health reform in 2007, which was largely concentrated\nwithin public programs and, therefore, within the networks of the four plans.\nReported problems finding a provider in fall 2008 varied across the state, with\nmore problems reported in the west (29 percent) and southeast (23 percent) re-\ngions, as compared to the Boston (20 percent), central (21 percent), metro west (17\npercent), and northeast (16 percent) regions.15 Reported difficulties finding a pro-\nvider tended to be more common in areas with lower provider supply, especially in\nareas located farther from Boston, with its concentration of providers.16\nConsistent with the reported difficulties in obtaining community-based care,\nwe saw no change from pre-reform levels in emergency department (ED) use for\nnonemergency conditions (that is, conditions that the respondent felt could have\nbeen treated in the community if a provider had been available; Exhibit 1). Such\nand 22 percent for lower-income adults.17 Thus, the changes to date under health\nreform have not translated into reductions in ED use for nonemergency condi-\ntions. When asked the reasons for ED visits for nonemergencies in fall 2008, 55.8\npercent of adults reported going because they were unable to get an appointment\nas soon as one was needed (data not shown).\nn Financial burden of health care. In the first year under health reform, the fi-\nnancial burden of health care on individuals dropped significantly, particularly for\nlower-income adults. By fall 2008, however, some of those gains in affordability had\neroded: the shares reporting problems paying medical bills and problems with med-\nical debt they were paying off over time moved back toward the fall 2006 levels for\nall adults and for lower-income adults (Exhibit 3).18 Furthermore, there were no lon-\nger reductions in the shares of adults overall who were spending high shares of fam-\nlower-income adults, the decline in the share spending 5 percent or more of family\nincome out of pocket continued through fall 2008 (down five percentage points\nfrom fall 2006 [these are regression-adjusted estimates; see Appendix Exhibit 3]),\nbut the share with out-of-pocket spending of 10 percent or more of family income in\nConsistent with the evidence of some increases in the burden of health care\ncosts in Massachusetts between fall 2007 and fall 2008, there were also some in-\ncreases in unmet need for care because of costs over that period.

The net result is that although unmet need because of costs remains rel-\natively low in the state, some of the reductions under health reform in fall 2006\nDiscussion\nRoughly two years after Massachusetts began implementing its ambitious\nhealth reform initiative, there are sustained signs of success.

These gains in access reflect both increases\nin insurance coverage and improvements in the coverage that is available.\nThere have also been gains in the affordability of health care for adults in Massa-\nchusetts under health reform. However, unlike the sustained gains in insurance\ncoverage and access, some of the early gains in the affordability of health care had\neroded by fall 2008, as health care costs continued to increase--as they have in the\nnation as a whole--potentially jeopardizing the gains under health reform.\nIn August 2008 Gov. Deval Patrick signed into law An Act to Promote Cost\nContainment, Transparency, and Efficiency in the Delivery of Quality Health Care,\nwhich seeks to contain health care costs as well as to improve access to and qual-\nity of care.20 The current proposal being developed would undertake fundamental\nreform of the health care payment system, moving away from fee-for-service to a\nglobal payment system that emphasizes care coordination and collaboration.\nThe proposed systematic change in the payment system in Massachusetts, by\nemphasizing coordination of care, offers the potential for addressing problems\nwith access to care and inefficiency in care delivery in Massachusetts, both of\nwhich predate health reform. In this study we found that adults in Massachusetts,\nalthough more likely to have health care visits under health reform than before, re-\nported difficulty finding providers who would see them and difficulty obtaining\ntimely appointments for care. Problems obtaining care occurred across all income\nlevels but were concentrated among lower-income adults, particularly those en-\nrolled in public programs. These findings are consistent with an ongoing survey of\nphysicians in Massachusetts that found the shares of internists accepting new pa-\ntients and MassHealth patients dropped under health reform, while wait times for\nappointments increased.21 Similarly, some community health centers reported lon-\nger waits for appointments under health reform.22\nDifficulty obtaining care in the community was reported to be an important\nfactor in the use of ED care for nonemergency conditions in Massachusetts in fall\n2008. Such use has not increased under health reform, but the high levels suggest\nthat inefficiency persists in the care delivery system. Addressing such use,\nwhether through payment reform or other measures, should translate into im-\nprovements in the quality of care for individuals and cost savings for individuals,\nhealth plans, and state programs.\nn Limitations of the study. This study provides interim estimates of the im-\npacts of health reform in Massachusetts. Most notably, these estimates are for the\ntime period before the larger penalty for not complying with the individual mandate\nwent into effect, before small businesses gained access to CommChoice, and before\nthe \"minimum creditable coverage\" standards for insurance coverage went into ef-\nfect. The estimates also predate any efforts at reforming health care payments,\nwhich is essential for the long-run sustainability of health reform.\nFurther, as noted above, the study design assigned all changes over time to the\nM a s s a c h u s e t t s U p d a t e\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 5 8 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Separating the effects of health reform from those of the\nrecession requires making use of data from national sources that will not be avail-\nable until late 2009 and 2010. However, the data available now suggest that the ef-\nfects of the recession were relatively limited in Massachusetts in fall 2008.\nFinally, we relied on survey data, which are subject to several types of error\n(coverage error, sampling error, measurement error, and nonresponse error).\nn Lessons for national reform. Two key lessons can be drawn from the most re-\ncent year of health reform in Massachusetts. First, although major expansions in\ncoverage can be achieved without addressing health care costs, cost pressures have\nthe potential to undermine the gains under reform. With its current focus on health\ncare costs, Massachusetts once again looks to be at the forefront of developing inno-\nvative strategies that will provide guidance to national reform efforts.\nSecond, in preparing for health reform at the national level, it will be important\nto ensure that the care delivery systems in communities across the country are\nready to support the planned expansion in coverage. As was true in Massachu-\nsetts, it is likely that existing constraints on provider supply across the country\nwould be exacerbated by an influx of newly insured people. There will no doubt\nbe much debate as to whether this means increasing the supply of physicians, as\nsome argue, or more fundamental changes in the health care system that address\nthe organization and delivery of health care, as others contend.23\nThisworkwassupportedbytheBlueCrossBlueShieldofMassachusettsFoundation,theCommonwealthFund,\nandtheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundation.ThesurveywasconductedbyInternationalCommunications\nResearch,nowSocialScienceResearchSolutions.Theauthorsofferspecialthankstocurrentandformerstaffat\nthethreefoundationsfortheirsupportoverthecourseoftheproject.Duringthepastyear,thisincludesValerie\nBassett,ElizabethCruz,CarenElias,AnneGauthier,RachelNuzum,StephanieMika,BrianQuinn,Marcy\nRavech,CathySchoen,andShannaShulman.ThanksalsotoJohnHolahanattheUrbanInstituteforhis\ncontributionstotheproject.ThesurveyswereconductedunderthedirectionofDavidDutwinandMelissa\nHerrmannatICR,withsupportfromTimTriplettattheUrbanInstitute.\nNOTES\n1.
