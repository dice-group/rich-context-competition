    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives: Chronic gneck and shoulder pain (CNSP) is a common clinical symptom of cervical\nspondylotic radiculopathy. Several studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (rs-fMRI) have reported that most chronic pain diseases are accompanied by structural and\nfunctional changes in the brain. However, few rs-fMRI studies have examined CNSP. The current\nstudy investigated cerebral structural and functional changes in CNSP patients.\nMethods: In total, 25 CNSP patients and 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. 3D-T1W\nand rs-fMRI images were acquired. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was applied to structural\nimages, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) was extracted from rs-fMRI. Statistical analysis was\nperformed on post-processing images and ReHo parameter maps.\nResults: The results revealed no significant differences in brain structure between the two groups.\nIn the patient group, ReHo values were significantly increased in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus\nand decreased in the left insula, superior frontal gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus, supplementary\nmotor area, right postcentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobule.\nConclusions: This initial structural and rs-fMRI study of CNSP revealed characteristic features of\nspontaneous brain activity of CNSP patients. These findings may be helpful for increasing our\nunderstanding of the neuropathology of CNSP.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1Department of Radiology, The First College of Clinical\nMedical Science of China Three Gorges University and\nYichang Central People's Hospital, Yichang, Hubei, China\n2Clinical Science, Philips Healthcare, Beijing, China\nCorresponding author:\nCheng-xin Yu, Department of Radiology, The First College\nof Clinical Medical Science of China Three Gorges\nUniversity and Yichang Central People's Hospital, No.183\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Specific alterations of ReHo\nvalues have been identified for the various\nreported that patients with tension-type\nheadache exhibited significantly lower\nReHo values in the bilateral caudate\nnucleus, precuneus, putamen, left middle\nfrontal gyrus (MFG) and superior frontal\ngyrus (SFG) and that these regions were\ninvolved in the integration and processing of\npain. Another study of migraine without\naura reported a significant decrease in the\nReHo values in the right anterior cingulate\ncortex, prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal\ncortex and supplementary motor area\n(SMA).15 In a study of experimentally-\ninduced low back pain, Zhang et al.17 sug-\ngested that brain regions exhibiting abnor-\nmal ReHo values were potentially associated\nwith pain processing. These results con-\nfirmed the diagnostic validity of ReHo for\nneuropsychiatric disorders in the field of\nchronic pain. Taken together, these findings\nindicate that ReHo can be considered a\nreliable and effective measure for investigat-\ning and characterizing spontaneous brain\nactivity, providing valuable information for\nunderstanding the neural mechanisms of\nAlthough many rs-fMRI studies have\ninvestigated the relationships between\nchanges in ReHo values and different types\nof chronic pain, few have focused on CNSP,\nwhich is a subtype of clinical chronic pain.\nBased on previous evidence, we hypothe-\nsized that CNSP patients would exhibit\nchanges in brain structure and ReHo. We\ntested this hypothesis by exploring struc-\ntural changes using VBM, and investigating\nthe characteristics of spontaneous brain\nactivity of patients with CNSP using ReHo.\nPatients and methods\nParticipants\nIn total, 25 patients with CNSP caused\nby CSR and 20 sex-, age- and education-\nmatched healthy volunteers with no neuro-\nlogical or pain disorders were included in\nthis study.\nThe inclusion criteria for the CNSP\ngroup were as follows: (1) CNSP persisted\nfor more than 3 months and involvement of\nthe nerve root was found with MRI or CT\n(several patients with severe pain and a high\nVAS scoreexhibited weakness and difficulty\nmoving their upper limbs); (2) positive\nfindings of pain-related symptoms in a\nphysical examination, including tenderness,\nnerve root traction and foraminal compres-\nsion; (3) no history of neurological or psy-\nchiatric disorders or cognitive dysfunction;\n(4) no accompanying pain in other parts of\nthe body, or CNSP caused by other causes\n(e.g., frozen shoulder or muscle strain); and\n(5) no other treatment was administered\n(i.e., drugs or acupuncture) that could\npotentially affect neurological function.\nAll included subjects provided written\ninformed consent prior to the acquisition\nof MR images, and the study was approved\nby the Medical Research Ethics Committee\nof Yichang Central People's Hospital\n(Yichang, China).\nData acquisition\nMRI data acquisition was performed using a\n3.0-Tesla scanner (Philips Intera Achieva,\nBest, Netherlands). Headphones and foam\npads were used to reduce noise interference\nand minimize head motion. Participants\nwere instructed to lie still in a relaxed\nposition with their eyes closed, while\nremaining awake and avoiding any specific\nthoughts. Functional images were acquired\nusing an echo planar imaging sequence\nTable 1. Demographic characteristics of CNSP patients and healthy controls.\nPatients\nControls\nNote: there were no significant differences in demographic variables between the two groups\nthickness \u00bc 4 mm, slices \u00bc 35, matrix size \u00bc\nframes were obtained, including the first 12\ndummy scans).Three-dimensional T1-weighted\nstructural images were collected using a fast\nspoiled-gradient echo sequence (TR\u00bc 11.1ms,\nData preprocessing\nThe structural and rs-fMRI images\nwere preprocessed using Statistical\nParametric Mapping (SPM8, http://www.\nrestfmri.net/forum/SPM) and Data\nProcessing Assistant for Resting-State\nfMRI (DPARSF, http://www.restfmri.net/\nforum/DPARSF), respectively.\nFor structural images, manual correction\nwas used if realignments with head move-\nments were more than 2 mm in translation\nand 2 in rotation. Brain tissue types were\nsegmented into gray matter (GM), white\nmatter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) in native space, and modulation was\nperformed. The resulting gray matter volume\n(GMV) images were normalized to Montreal\nNeurological Institute (MNI) standard space\nand smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian\nkernel. For rs-fMRI images, the first 20 time\npoints (including the first 12 dummy scans)\nwere removed; and then slice timing was done\ndue to scan with an interval technique.\nRealignments with head movements were\nless than 2 mm in translation and 2 in rota-\ntion. Functional images were normalized to\nMNI standard space using the echo planar\nimaging (EPI) template, and resampled\nthe signals was removed, and a filter with a\nReHo analyses\nReHo was computed based on the KCC of\nthe time series of the voxel and its nearest\nneighbours (26 voxels) using DPARSF, fol-\nlowed by a smoothing procedure with a\nGaussian kernel with a full-width-half-max-\nimum (FWHM) of 4 mm to minimize the\nnoise and residual differences of the prepro-\ncessed images.\nStatistical analysis\nIndependent two-sample t-tests were used\nto compare the continuous demographic\nvariables, and chi-square tests were used to\nexamine the proportions between groups\nwith SPSS 13.0. One-sample t-tests were\nperformed on the individual ReHo maps\nfor each group using REST Statistical\nAnalysis software to explore within-group\nReHo characteristics. Two-sample t-tests\nwere applied to examine differences in the\nReHo values and GMV between the\npatient and control groups. Age, sex, and\neducation levels were analysed as\ncovariates.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics\nThe demographic characteristics of all par-\nticipants are shown in Table 1. There were\nno significant differences in demographic\nvariables between the two groups (p > 0.05).\nResults\nVBM results\nIndependent two-sample t-tests revealed no\nsignificant differences in GMV between the\nCNSP and control groups (p < 0.05).\nWithin-group ReHo maps\nFigure 1 shows the ReHo maps of the CNSP\nand control groups. In both groups, standar-\ndized ReHo values in the posterior cingulate\ncortex, precuneus, inferior parietal lobule,\nand medial prefrontal cortex were signifi-\ncantly higher than the mean global (whole-\nbrain) values. The ReHo patterns were\nsimilar to those of the human default mode\nnetwork (DMN).\nGroup differences in ReHo\nAs seen in the ReHo maps in Figure 2, the\nanalysis revealed significant differences in\nbrain activity between the CNSP and con-\ntrol groups (p < 0.01; AlphaSim correction,\ncluster threshold ! 18). The results showed\nsignificantly decreased ReHo values in the\nleft insula, SFG, middle cingulate gyrus\n(MCG), SMA and right postcentral gyrus\n(PCG) and superior parietal lobule (SPL).\nIn contrast, significantly increased ReHo\nvalues were mainly found in the bilateral\nMFG (See Table 2 for a detailed list of all\nregions exhibiting increased ReHo values).\nDiscussion\nThe current study was a preliminary inves-\ntigation of alterations in brain structure and\nfunction in patients with CNSP using VBM\nand ReHo analysis, respectively. We found\nthat VBM of T1-weighted anatomical\nimages revealed no significant structural\nchanges in GMV in CNSP patients.\nHowever, the analysis demonstrated alter-\nations of regional brain spontaneous activity\nin specific brain areas.\nVBM analyses\nA number of previous studies using VBM\nhave reported that various types of long-\nterm chronic pain can lead to a reduction of\nIn contrast to previous reports, the current\nfindings revealed no decrease in GMV. To\ninvestigate this discrepancy, in future studies\nwe will refine the CNSP patient groups\naccording to clinical information, including\npatient's age, pain duration, attack fre-\nquency, and pain intensity, and analyse\nchanges in brain structure for each group.\nSeveral previous studies have reported that\nalterations in brain GMV caused by chronic\npain can be reversible.26,27 Recent studies\nhave suggested that chronic pain is more\nFigure 1.

The results revealed that ReHo\nvalues in the posterior cingulate cortex,\nprecuneus, inferior parietal lobule and\nmedial prefrontal cortex were all significantly\nhigher than the global mean values, for both\nthe CNSP patient and control groups. In\naddition, the observed ReHo patterns were\nsimilar to those of the human DMN, con-\nfirming the reliability of the analysis method.29\nReHo differences between the CNSP and\ncontrol groups\nCompared with healthy controls, CNSP\npatients exhibited abnormal neural activity\nFigure 2.

The results\nshowed that the regions with increased\nReHo values were predominantly located\nat the bilateral MFG, and that those with\ndecreased ReHo values were located in the\nleft insula, SFG, MCG, SMA and right\nPCG, and SPL. These results are largely\nconsistent with those of previous studies of\nThe abnormal activity identified in the\ncurrent study was predominantly concen-\ntrated in the left hemisphere, possibly\nrelated to the clinical observation of left-\nhemispheric predominance in right-handed\npatients. Tanja et al.31 reported left-\nhemisphere dominance of the early sensory\ncomponent of pain perception using brain\nelectrical source analysis. The MCG is part\nof the limbic lobe, which is associated with\naffective processing during the experience\nof pain.32 According to the James-Lange\ntheory, the insula and limbic lobe are\ncritical for emotional processing and pain\nmemory, a role previously ascribed to the\nlimbic system.33 A number of neuroima-\nging studies have revealed that the insula is\na functionally comprehensive, heteroge-\nneous and multisensory integrated brain\nregion that participates in the processing of\npain perception and emotion, as well as the\nsensory discrimination of pain perception,\nacting as the primary cortex for interocep-\nare key regions involved in the ``pain\nmatrix'', which is considered to be involved\nin the perception of pain intensity and\nemotional, homeostatic, sensorimotor and\ncognitive functioning.36,37. A recent study\nsuggested that the insula plays an import-\nant role in the triggering of the pain matrix\nnetwork and the resulting emergence of the\nsubjective pain experience.38 Previous stu-\ndies have suggested that the resting state\nanterior insula-anterior cingulate cortex/\nmid-cingulate cortex (ACC/MCC) system\nintegrates interoceptive emotional informa-\ntion to form a subjective representation of\nthe body, and there is evidence that the\nentire insula-MCC system is likely to be\ninvolved in environmental monitoring,\nresponse selection and skeletomotor body\norientation.39 Thus, the decreased ReHo\nTable 2.

The frontal lobe is\ninvolved in a range of comprehensive and\ncomplex functions, including integrating\nand regulating affective and memory infor-\nmation, personality, and cognition.40 The\nSFG and MFG play a role in modulating\nthe cortical and subcortical nociceptive\npathways.41 Thus, the ReHo values in\nbilateral MFG are likely to be significantly\nincreased when people are in a state of\nchronic pain. Many previous studies of\nvarious types of pain have reported ReHo\nchanges in the frontal lobe, but have\ntypically focused on the prefrontal lobe,\nwhich is related to affective processing.42,43\nFurther studies are needed to explore the\nrole of the MFG in pain processing in\nmore depth. The decrease in ReHo values\nwe observed in PCG is consistent with the\nresults of a previous study.17 The PCG\ncomprises the primary somatosensory\ncortex (S1), which is involved in the\nsomatotopic changes associated with pain\nintensity, and the discrimination of the\nsensory components of pain perception\nThe SPL and inferior parietal lobule also\nbelong to S1. The main function of the\nparietal lobe is to integrate various types of\nsensory information, which is similar to the\nrole of the PCG.44 A number of previous\nreports have proposed that the SMA is\ncrucial for linking cognition to action, and\nis primarily involved in controlling move-\nments (since neurons in the SMA project\ndirectly to the spinal cord), pain anticipa-\npatients with CNSP, decreased ReHo\nvalues in the SMA may be related to\ndeficits in pain modulation and affective\nresponse inhibition.15 In the current study,\nseveral patients with severe pain and a high\nVAS score exhibited weakness and\ndifficulty moving their upper limbs, which\nmay also be associated with decreased\nReHo values in the SMA. Based on the\ncurrent findings and the results of previous\nstudies, we speculate that patients with\ndifferent types of chronic pain may share a\ncommon neurological and pathophysio-\nlogical basis, and that long-term chronic\npain is not only involves pain, but also\naccompanied with the dysfunction of sen-\nsory, cognitive and affection.\nThe MCG, which exhibited decreased\nReHo values, is part of the anterior DMN,\nthe insula participates in the composition of\nthe cingulate-insular network (CIN), and\nthe PCG and SMA are a part of the\nsensorimotor network (SMN).49 Abnormal\nbrain activity in these regions may have an\nimpact on pain-related intrinsic connectivity\nnetworks, including the DMN, CIN and\nSMN in CNSP during the resting state. No\nsignificant changes in ReHo values were\nfound in the ACC or PFC, in contrast with\nrent findings suggest that brain regions\nexhibiting changes in ReHo values may be\nrelated to the location of pain and its various\ncomponents (e.g., pain duration, attack fre-\nquency and pain intensity). The discrepancy\nbetween the current results and previous\nreports may be related to these factors.\nFurther considerations\nThe current findings suggest that regional\nabnormalities of selective brain regions are\nrelated to pain perception, cognition and\naffective processing. These results may have\nimplications for the clinical treatment of\nCNSP, raising the possibility that the sub-\njective pain perception of patients with\nCNSP might be decreased by reducing\nbrain activation in targeted areas associated\nAlthough preliminary findings are promis-\ning, more research is needed before rs-fMRI\ncan be used routinely in the clinic.\nIn addition future studies with larger sample\nsizes are needed to confirm the current\nfindings. Specifically, further work is\nneeded to compare the influence of various\ncomponents of pain on brain function,\nincluding pain duration, attack frequency\nand pain intensity. Further exploration of\naltered functional connectivity in these brain\nregions is necessary.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, the current study used ReHo\nto reveal abnormal neuronal activity in\nmultiple regions involved in the integration\nand processing of pain signals in the resting-\nstate in CNSP patients, including the bilat-\neral MFG, left insula, SFG, MCG, SMA,\nand right PCG and SPL. This preliminary\nstudy suggests that these brain regions may\nbe suitable targets for chronic pain treat-\nment, and provide a foundation for other\nresearch to extend treatment strategies for\nCNSP patients.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
