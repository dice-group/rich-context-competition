    "abstract": "Abstract\nWorldwide, nurse shortage and high turnover rates are observed. Job satisfaction is a major determinant of retention and is\ninfluenced by intraorganizational communication and perceived communication satisfaction. This article presents a narrative\nreview on communication satisfaction, job satisfaction, and their mutual relationship as well as their impact on turnover\nintention and burnout risk in the nursing profession. A literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed, Web of\nScience, and The Cochrane Library, and 47 articles were included. Descriptive analysis identified different types of social\nnetworks in the health care workplace. There is a positive association between communication and job satisfaction among\nnurses, translating into decreased turnover intention and burnout risk. Job satisfaction is required both for organizational\nstability as for coguaranteeing patient safety. This will be best achieved through an organization-wide multimodal prevention\nand intervention program, aimed at optimizing different modalities of interprofessional communication, workload, and job\nsatisfaction.\nKeywords\nburnout, communication, work satisfaction, interpersonal communication, patient safety.\n2 SAGE Open\ninclusion criteria were maintained: (a) published between\nthe following categories: original research, reviews, meta-\nanalyses, or letters to the editor; and (c) available as a full\ntext in English. Database screening was finished on\ntitle and abstract. The whole article was read if all inclusion\nrequirements were present or if this was unclear. After read-\ning the full text, papers that did not fulfill all requirements\nwere excluded. The snowball method was used to search for\nadditional literature.\nBefore writing the article, a predesign of five categories\nwas framed, including interprofessional communication in\nhealth care, deficits in communication and influence on patient\nsafety, communication satisfaction, job satisfaction and nurse\nturnover or burnout, and, finally, recommendations. Papers\nwere allocated to one or more categories. During the writing\nprocess, each category was addressed separately and all arti-\ncles related to a particular category were reread.\nResults\nThe results of the search process are summarized in a\nPRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1). Out of a total of 4,865\npapers selected, 2,161 duplicates were removed. Two thou-\nsand seven hundred four records were screened, of which\nwere included in the review.\nInterprofessional Communication in Health Care\nWithin health care, much like any other work context, the\nbehavior of each individual is influenced by the surrounding\nsocial network. This social network is important for the dis-\nsemination of information. Social networks are advanta-\ngeous for people's career and job performance (van Beek\nVan Beek distinguishes three types of social networking\nin an organization: communication, consulting, and trust net-\nworks (van Beek et al., 2011). The communication network\nconsists of employees who regularly discuss work-related\nissues. The advice or consulting network includes employees\nwho are invoked to solve problems and exchange informa-\ntion. The trust network describes those who share and receive\ndelicate or sensitive information in problem situations.\nThese networks are important for the provision of quality\ncare to the patient. In this article, we focus on the communi-\ncation networks. Such networks are strongly related to job\nFigure 1. Review stages based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.\nVermeir et al. 3\nsatisfaction. Nurses working in units with a close communi-\ncation network are more satisfied with their work. In units\nwith few employees, nurses are more likely to be satisfied\nwith their work compared with units with many employees\n(van Beek et al., 2011). The quality of both communication\nand advice networks was negatively related to the number of\nnursing staff on units. Job satisfaction differed significantly\ninterindividually and between units and was influenced by\nthe number of nursing staff.\nCommunication and advice networks were denser when\nmore nurses worked part-time. Furthermore, density of com-\nmunication networks increased by higher age of the nursing\nThe health care team is an intact group of caregivers who\nare motivated to communicate with each other about the care\nof the patients they are entrusted with. Poole and Real subdi-\nvided such care teams with regard to their purpose and func-\ntion (Real & Poole, 2011). First, the ad hoc team is made up\nfor a restricted period to solve a problem, after which it disap-\npears. Second, within a nominal care team, patients are\nreferred by General Practitioners (GPs) to specialists and both\noffer independent care. Third, a unidisciplinary team consists\nof members of a single discipline. Fourth, a multidisciplinary\nteam is composed of different disciplines working together,\nbut the care they offer is sequential. Fifth, an interdisciplinary\nteam is again composed of different disciplines, this time\nworking interdependently, that is, they work and communicate\ntogether about the patient's care. Finally, in transdisciplinary\nteams, this interdependent collaboration between different dis-\nciplines allows caregivers to transcend competencies in their\nown field and to benefit from the skills of the other disciplines\ninvolved in the collaboration. These teams each have their\nown particular forms of communication. For caregivers, it is\nimportant to be able to identify with a type of team to know\nwhat the best way to communicate and to work efficiently and\ncan belong to different types of teams with their particular\nmodalities and requirements of communication.\nTo better understand communication within health care\nteams, the input\u00adprocess\u00adoutput (IPO) model of communi-\ncation in care teams was developed and derived from the\ngroup perspective (Real & Poole, 2011, Figure 2). This\n\"group dynamics perspective\" conveys understanding of\nhow and why caregivers interact in certain ways and clarifies\nhow teams function. The model describes communication\nstructures (inputs) and processes. These, in turn, create out-\nputs that can affect the results of the care teams (Brock et al.,\nWithin health care teams deficient communication can\narise from critical information not being communicated\nbetween team members, conflicting relationships, or a lack\nof clarity on roles and job descriptions. Misinterpretation of\ninformation can be caused by the use of different terminol-\nogy or the provision of incomplete information. Although a\nwhole team delivers medical care, medical quality and safety\nhave mainly been centered on individual expert practitioners\n(Leonard, Graham, & Bonacum, 2004). According to\nLeonard et al., \"Effective communication and teamwork is\nassumed, however formal training and assessment in these\nareas has been largely absent\" (Leonard et al., 2004, p. i85).\nRecognition that the clinical care environment has become\nprogressively more complex, combined with the inherent\nlimitations of human performance, has spurred interest in\napplying the lessons of other high-reliability industries to\nmedicine (Leonard et al., 2004). Many factors contribute to\nFigure 2. Input/process/output model of communication in health care teams (Real & Poole, 2011) .\n4 SAGE Open\ncommunication failures, which are \"the leading cause of\ninadvertent patient harm\" (Aiken et al., 2012). In the first\nplace, doctors and nurses are trained to communicate in a\nare taught to be rather comprehensive and narrative in their\ndescriptions of clinical situations, whereas physicians need\nto be very concise, and quickly get to the \"headlines.\" Nurses\noften report that they are told during their education that they\n\"don't make diagnoses.\" So, in mutual contacts, the doctors\nimpatiently \"wait to find out what the nurses want\" (Finn,\n2001). In addition, the hierarchy within the team can also\ncause disturbances in communication. Leadership with\nstrong authority often leads to less communication within the\nteam. In contrast, leadership that is able to handle the hierar-\nchy appropriately, by creating a trustworthy and secure envi-\nronment, ensures faster communication and more\nparticipation within the team (Leonard et al., 2004).\nInadequate or incorrect information during a shift handover\nmay also cause communication problems. A final potential\nrisk area for miscommunication involves any transfer of the\npatient from one care point to the other (Greenberg et al.,\nDeficits in Communication and Influence on\nPatient Safety\nEffective communication and teamwork are essential to pro-\nvide high-quality care and patient safety (Vermeir et al.,\n2015). Poor communication can lead to various negative out-\ncomes, such as discontinuity of care and compromise of\npatient safety (Vermeir et al., 2015). The complexity of med-\nical care along with the limitations of human action reinforce\nthe importance of standardized communication and a secure\nenvironment, in which team members can express their con-\ncerns about patient safety. In such an environment, members\ncan speak freely and critical language can be used to create\nalertness and to avoid confusion (Brock et al., 2013; Kalisch,\nInterprofessional teamwork is achieved by the interactive\nefforts of all team members involved through good commu-\nnication and respect for the role of all team members. There\nshould be room for the contribution of each team member.\nNot only the technical skills of the team, such as knowledge\nand experience, contribute to improving patient safety, but\nalso nontechnical skills, such as communication, team size,\nthe psychological mind-set, and the way the team is run, can\naffect team performance. Despite the increased emphasis on\nthese nontechnical skills, communication problems remain a\nfrequent cause of reduced patient safety (Brock et al., 2013;\nCourtenay, Nancarrow, & Dawson, 2013; Keith, Coburn, &\nCommunication takes place within and between systems,\nas exemplified in inpatient, transmural, and outpatient care\nand within the chain of pre-, intra-, and postoperative care.\nCommunication may involve a large group of people such as\nsurgeons, nurses, support staff, anesthesiologists, and include\na range of critical issues, such as patient status, intraopera-\ntive events, and care plan. Most communication deficits\noccur within a single department, but can also occur between\ndepartments and between different institutions. The majority\nof errors in communication result from verbal communica-\ntion. Reducing the number of communication errors could\nsignificantly reduce the number of medical errors and, hence,\nMedical errors, especially those caused by communica-\ntion failures, are an omnipresent problem in today's health\ncare organizations. In the perioperative period for instance,\nthe prevalence of communication deficiencies is high. In an\nobservational study of 48 surgical cases with 421 identified\ncommunication events, one third were classified as \"fail-\nAn analysis by the Joint Commission for Hospital\ncare were caused by defective and faulty communication\nwithin a team (Leonard et al., 2004). Medical errors are pre-\ndominantly the consequence of a system failure and cannot\nbe reduced to an individual mistake. The majority of errors\nare made in high-risk environments such as the trauma set-\nting (Courtenay et al., 2013). In the past, patient risks were\nattributed to the extent of the disease, comorbidities, and the\ndifficulty of the procedure, with negligible focus on the role\nof caregivers. In the past decade, this viewpoint has changed.\nWith the growing importance of patient safety, the influence\nof the health care provider on health outcomes is empha-\nsized. Experts argue that the quality of communication\nbetween health care providers and the environment deter-\nmines medical errors (Greenberg et al., 2007). Indeed, \"these\nerrors have the potential to cause severe injury or unexpected\naddition, communication problems have an economic impact\nand may result in decreased access to care (Brock et al.,\nCommunication and Communication Satisfaction\nIn non\u00adhealth care settings, communication has been studied\nas a contributor to job satisfaction and job performance\n(Pincus, 1986). By performing a factor analysis, Downs and\nHazen (Wagner et al., 2015) identified eight dimensions of\n\"communication satisfaction\": (a) communication climate\n(general satisfaction with the communication environment),\n(b) supervisor communication, (c) media quality, (d) hori-\nzontal communication, (e) organizational integration (infor-\nmation relevant to performing job), (f) personal feedback, (g)\norganizational perspective (information about organization\nas a whole), and (h) subordinate communication (for super-\nvisors only). Their \"Communication Satisfaction\nQuestionnaire\" is based on these dimensions. Two studies\n(Kaddourah, Khalidi, Abu-Shaheen, & Al-Tannir, 2013;\nVermeir et al. 5\nPincus, 1986) identified the first, second, and sixth dimen-\nsion as the strongest predictors of job satisfaction. The other\ndimensions were also associated with job satisfaction. Only\nthe second and sixth dimensions were associated with job\nThis positive association between communication satis-\nfaction and job satisfaction has been demonstrated among\nnurses as well (Manojlovich & Antonakos, 2008; Mokoka,\nSquires et al., 2015). Communication satisfaction with one's\nsupervisor has been shown to be associated with greater\norganizational commitment (Moideenkutty, Blau, Kumar, &\nto the prevention nursing turnover (Blegen, 1993).\nJob Satisfaction, Intention to Leave, and Burnout\nIt is clear that communication affects job satisfaction and\nthat job satisfaction affects nurses' turnover. Low job satis-\nfaction can lead to a high turnover, which negatively influ-\nences quality of care. Moreover, this causes extra recruitment\nand training costs for the organization (Probst et al., 2010).\nFurthermore, patient satisfaction is also influenced by nurses'\njob satisfaction. Specifically, high job satisfaction is associ-\nated with higher motivation, which in turn is associated with\nhigher patient satisfaction about received care (Tzeng, 2002).\nAccording to Maslow's needs theory, job satisfaction can\nbe defined as a form of need fulfillment, as \"the match of\npersonal needs to the perceived potential of the job for satis-\nfying those needs\" or to the perception of rewards associated\nwith the job. In contrast, Herzberg and Mausner's motiva-\ntion\u00adhygiene theory rather defines it as \"a function of satis-\nfaction with the various elements of the job.\" The presence\nof motivating factors lead to motivated and satisfied employ-\nees, whereas hygiene factors do not lead to satisfaction but\ntheir absence leads to dissatisfaction (Herzberg & Mausner,\n1959). Hygiene factors such as indirect working environ-\nment (a hospital's policies, benefits, leisure activities), sal-\nary, and promotion were found to be very important but\nstrongly dissatisfying (Tzeng, 2002). However, each person\nexperiences job satisfaction differently. This is highly depen-\ndent on intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. Concrete examples\nof intrinsic factors are receiving recognition for one's work,\nresponsibility, ability to make decisions, challenges, perfor-\nmances, and self-actualization. Extrinsic factors include the\nbehavior of executives, wages, organizational culture, work-\ning conditions (including sufficient time to perform tasks),\nand safety in the workplace (Herzberg & Mausner, 1959).\nThe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors is,\nhowever, not absolute. Leadership style, for example, is seen\nas an extrinsic factor but influences job satisfaction addition-\nally through its effect on empowerment (intrinsic; Morrison,\nJones, & Fuller, 1997). In the theory of Spector, lastly, the\nfocus is on the cognitive process: \"the affective orientation\nof an employee towards his job.\" This can be seen as a global\nfeeling, or rather as a related configuration of attitudes about\ndifferent features of the job (e.g., appreciation, job condi-\ntions, pay, security, personal growth and communication;\nAmong nurses, intrinsic factors are especially important\n(Probst et al., 2010). Nurses get their motivation from pro-\ntecting the patients' lives and helping them to stay or to\nbecome healthy (Kudo et al., 2010).Areview of the literature\non job satisfaction among nurses revealed that interaction\n(with patients, colleagues and managers) is another impor-\ntant source of job satisfaction (Lu, While, & Barriball, 2005).\nAdams and Bond observed that although nurses want auton-\nomy, they also require the support of good interpersonal rela-\ntionships (Adams & Bond, 2000). Some studies focused on\nthe importance of a good interaction with the management .\nProbst et al. (2010) observed that job satisfaction increases\nwhen supervisors communicate clearly, provide clear instruc-\ntions, and show appreciation for the nurses' work. Others\nhighlight the importance of good coworker relationships\nquantitative studies of nurses' job satisfaction dating from\n1993 revealed, however, only moderate correlations between\njob satisfaction and communication with supervisors and\npeers (Blegen, 1993). Thirteen variables were frequently\nexamined with relation to job satisfaction. Four of these were\npersonal attributes or personality traits, for example, age,\neducation, years of experience, and locus of control. The\nother nine were organizational features or job attitudes:\nstress, commitment, supervisor communication, autonomy,\nrecognition, routinization, peer communication, fairness,\nand professionalism. The variables exhibiting the strongest\nrelationship with job satisfaction (correlation coefficients in\nparenthesis) were stress (.61) and commitment (.53). The\nfollowing five variables were moderately related to job satis-\nfaction. These were communication with supervisor (.45),\ncommunication with peers (.36). Variables with small to\nmoderate relationships were fairness (.30) and locus of con-\n(.07), and professionalism (.06) displayed limited correla-\ntions with job satisfaction.\nA more recent cross-sectional study confirms that a high\nworkload (due to low staffing) is related to stress, which in\nturn negatively related to job satisfaction (Kaddourah et al.,\nworked, dissatisfied with their income, and experienced\nlimited autonomy as well as poor communication with\nsuperiors. In another study, seven factors related to nurses'\njob satisfaction were identified: the ability to specialize in\none's work, safety at work, relations with supervisors,\nwork\u00adlife balance, relationships with other nurses, commu-\nnication, and wages (Yin & Yang, 2002). Overall, this sug-\ngests that there is a need for hospitals and government\nauthorities to strive to implement strategies that alleviate\nworkload and empower nurses to control their practice. The\n6 SAGE Open\nformulation of such strategies requires insights into the\nmechanisms of job (dis)satisfaction.\nThe \"met expectations theory\" is often used to describe\njob (dis)satisfaction. This theory states that individuals have\ncertain expectations of a job. When these expectations are\nnot met, individuals experience dissatisfaction (Best &\nThurston, 2004). However, this theory does not incorporate\nthe possible outcomes of job dissatisfaction, such as staff\nturnover and turnover intention. Hence, a conceptual model\nexplaining the relationships between job dissatisfaction and\nstaff turnover is useful (Castle, Engberg, Anderson, & Men,\nAccording to this model, turnover intention is influenced\nby personal characteristics (age and gender), role-related\ncharacteristics, facility characteristics (staff level), and\nopportunities to change jobs. These four factors can influ-\nence job characteristics and intent to leave. The turnover\nintention consists of three phases: thinking about leaving,\nthinking about looking for another job, and actually looking\nfor another job. In each phase, the turnover intention\nincreases. In reality, nurses first experience job dissatisfac-\ntion and then proceed to these three phases (Castle et al.,\nSeveral studies measured the impact of job satisfaction on\nintention to leave and burnout. Cavanagh and Coffin have\nfound that job satisfaction and job participation are crucial\nvariables in the turnover process, and job satisfaction was\ncorrelated with intent to stay (r = .34, p < .05; B. Hayes,\nBonner, & Pryor, 2010). A later study found an even higher\ncorrelation coefficient (r = .48, p < .005) between the two\nmeasures (Gauci Borda & Norman, 1997). A meta-analysis\none of the strongest factors related to nurse turnover. Two\nmore recent studies confirm this (Castle et al., 2007; Kudo\net al., 2010). Unsatisfied nurses reported to be strongly com-\nmitted to the quality of care, which may be hampered by the\nexperience of high workload (Castle et al., 2007; Sellgren,\nKajermo, Ekvall, & Tomson, 2009). Kudo et al. found that\nthe relationship with supervisors is a crucial factor in job\nturnover. In addition, older nurses were less likely to leave\nthe organization because they have acquired more responsi-\nbility, more involvement, and more competencies to cope\nJob dissatisfaction is also associated with burnout among\nhealth care staff (McHugh, Kutney-Lee, Cimiotti, Sloane, &\nfrustration brought about by devotion to a cause, way of life,\nor relationship that failed to produce the expected reward\"\ntion has been found to be associated with each of the three\ndimensions of burnout, namely, emotional exhaustion,\ndepersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment\nIn 2012, an international study on patient safety, satisfac-\ntion, and quality of care (Aiken et al., 2012), including\n61,168 nurses, from the United States and Europe, showed\nhigh levels of job dissatisfaction, turnover intention, and\nburnout. High rates of nurse burnout were found (ranging\nfrom 10% in the Netherlands to 78% in Greece), job dissatis-\nfaction (ranging from 11% in the Netherlands to 56% in\nGreece), and intention to leave (ranging from 14% in the\nUnited States to 49% in Finland and Greece).Among Belgian\nFigure 3.

This model was developed on the basis of\nempirical evidence and is the result of a collaboration\nbetween the U.S. Department of Defence (as part of their\npatient safety program) and the agency for health care,\nresearch, and quality. The TeamSTEPPS program consists of\nthree phases. The first step consists of an assessment of the\ncommunication needs. Second, training and exercises are\nperformed in a controlled and simulated environment. In the\nfinal phase, the training program is implemented and main-\ntained in the work situation (Coburn & Gage-Croll, 2011,\nFigure 4).\nThrough this program, the competencies of leadership, sit-\nuation monitoring, mutual support, and communication can be\nacquired. The training aims to increase mutual respect within\na team and to improve the ability to act safely, regardless of the\nfunction or role within the team (Coburn & Gage-Croll, 2011).\nThe effectiveness of this method was evaluated in 306 fourth-\nyear medical, third-year nursing, second-year pharmacy, and\nsecond-year physician assistant students with 149 students\ncompleting a 4-hr training with pre- and postintervention\nassessments. Positive attitudinal and knowledge effects were\nseen among these students: significant improvements were\nfound for attitudes toward team communication (p < .001),\nmotivation (p < .001), advocating for patients (p < .001), util-\nity of training (p < .001), and self-efficacy (p = .005). Important\nattitudinal shifts for TeamSTEPPS skills comprised team\nstructure (p = .002), situation monitoring (p < .001), mutual\nsupport (p = .003), and communication (p = .002; Brock et al.,\nsuccessfully adapted and implemented to improve patient\nsafety through team training. On one hand, team training\nincreases communication and reduces error; on the other hand,\nbuilding a patient safety infrastructure supports teamwork\nThe errors committed by one or more team members need\nto be discussed openly and minimization needs to be avoided.\nThis is not always guaranteed. Nevertheless, within the\nhealth care culture, the emphasis lies on quality of care and\ndelivery of flawless performance. Learning from errors\nshould become more embedded in health care delivery. If\nerrors cannot be openly discussed, individuals experience\nstress and fatigue, resulting in impaired memory and a lim-\nited ability to multitask (Blegen, 1993).\nAccording to Greenberg et al., three interventions exist to\nreduce communication errors (Greenberg et al., 2007). The\nfirst is described as \"a set of triggers\" (Table 1). When a trig-\nger from this list occurs, a nurse, or other team member\ninvolved in the care of the patient, is required to communi-\ncate the event with their colleagues. A second method is the\nuse of a \"read-back.\" This is the repetition of a previously\nwritten message, used for confirmation. Finally, protocols\nfor shift handover and transfers are seen as a means to reduce\ncommunication deficits.\nLeonard et al. consider the SBAR structure as a solution\nfor such communication problems (Leonard et al., 2004).\nSBAR stands for situation, background, assessment, and rec-\nommendation. \"Situation\" examines what happens to the\npatient, \"background\" investigates the clinical background\nof the patient, \"assessment\" analyzes the problem, and \"rec-\nommendation\" determines how the team could resolve the\nsituation. By combining these four descriptions, a short and\nclear overview of the situation is given, and another care-\ngiver can respond quickly. Leonard et al. (2004) also stress\nthe importance of debriefing to avoid miscommunication\nand to increase patient safety. Following a procedure or at the\nend of the day, a brief discussion is held on what the team did\nwell, what challenges arose, and what should be handled in a\ndifferent manner in the future. A debriefing provides an\nopportunity to learn, for both the individual and the team.\nFigure 4. Team strategies and tools to enhance performance\nand patient safety communications model.\nSource.

During the literature search across a\nnumber of databases, a vast amount of articles were screened.\nA limitation of this review is that it has not taken cultural and\nsocial contextual factors into account, which may also influ-\nence job satisfaction.\nSeveral recommendations can be drawn from the present\nliterature review:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Underline the importance of the psychosocial work\nenvironment and the relationship between burnout,\nrole conflict, job satisfaction, and psychosomatic\nhealth (problems) in health care staff (Piko, 2006).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Acknowledge that improvements in this field should\nbe a priority and that the implementation of interven-\ntions, which focuses on the intrinsic values of nurses\ncan help to prevent job burnout, increase job satis-\nfaction, and reduce turnover. Information on the psy-\nchosocial work climate is necessary to provide a\nbasis for such interventions. From a practical per-\nspective, these issues are central to changes in man-\nagement practices, which should be integrated in\ncontinuous reform.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Acknowledge that \"cultural change is at the heart of\nthis quest\" (Leonard et al., 2004). Care should be trans-\nformed from the culture of the individual expert physi-\ncian to a truly collaborative team environment (Leonard\net al., 2004). Currently, different communication styles\nof physicians, nurses, and others hamper this aim. The\ncomplexity of the care system necessitates a change\ntoward a culture of open communication and collabora-\ntion. Such change is essential for safeguarding clinical\noutcomes.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Create and maintain a work environment in which\nparticipative management thrives. This can be\nachieved by increasing psychological empowerment,\nwhile reaffirming and strengthening the role as well as\nthe skills of nurse leaders.

Such research has largely\nbeen driven by the need for hospitals to become increasingly\ncompetitive, often in response to a restriction of resources, creat-\ning new challenges in the workplace. Within the context of a\nworldwide nurse shortage and high turnover rates (Gandhi,\nness remains an important goal (Pincus, 1986; Wagner,\nBezuidenhout, & Roos, 2015). This global shortage is associated\nwith a loss of trained nurses, times of poor staffing and extra\nwork for remaining nurses, increased costs of enrollment and\norientation of new nurses, and, most important, a potential\nincrease in adverse patient outcomes (Larrabee et al., 2003). Job\nsatisfaction has been identified as a major determinant of nurse\nretention and performance (L. Hayes et al., 2006). Moreover, the\nquality of intraorganizational communication and perceived\ncommunication satisfaction influence job satisfaction at different\nlevels and for all types of employees within the organization.\nAims\nWe aimed to perform a narrative literature review on job sat-\nisfaction in relation to communication satisfaction, with a\nspecific focus on nursing professionals in hospitals.\nMethod\nWe searched the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and\nThe Cochrane Library through the keywords \"communica-\ntion,\" \"patient safety,\" \"job satisfaction,\" \"burnout,\" \"com-\nmunication satisfaction,\" \"nursing,\" and \"nurse turnover,\"\nwhich were internally validated by the coauthors.
