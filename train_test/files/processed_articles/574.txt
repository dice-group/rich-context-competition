The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that\nnearly half of these deaths occur among adults aged 30 to 69 years\nold [2]. The prevalence of hypertension has risen exponentially in\nIndia over the past three decades, from less than 5% of adults to\nover 25% of urban and 10% of rural adults today [3].\nHigh salt intake is associated with increased risk of myocardial\ninfarction (MI) and stroke [4], principally because salt intake\nsignificantly affects blood pressure [5,6]. Although the WHO\nrecommends that adults consume less than 5 grams (g) of salt per\nday in order to reduce hypertension-associated cardiovascular and\ncerebrovascular disease, Indian adults consume between 8.5 g and\n15 g per day on average [7,8] (as compared to an average 8.9 g\nper day among Americans [9]).\nSeveral Western countries including the UK and Finland have\nimplemented regulations on salt content in food, experiencing\nassociated declines in per capita salt intake and heart attacks,\nstrokes and deaths [10,11,12]. Whether and how to reduce India's\nhigh level of dietary salt intake is currently being debated [13].\nSeveral commentators have suggested that the reductions in salt\nintake necessary for lowering cardiovascular mortality in develop-\ning countries like India are unrealistically large, that benefits would\naccrue only among urban populations exposed to Western diets,\nand that the rural poor would experience higher disease rates\nrelated to iodine deficiency because of inadequate intake of iodized\nTo explore these assertions, we constructed a mathematical\nmodel of MI and stroke in India.\nMethods\nWe constructed a Markov (state-transition) model of MI and\nstroke among India's population following conventional standards\nfor decision-analytic modeling [18]. The detailed model is\nspecified in Text S1 to permit full replication of our results; here,\nwe outline the general structure, critical assumptions and\nvalidation of the model.\nModel structure\nThe model simulates Indian adults organized into twelve\nand 60\u00ad69 year old cohorts) and location (urban versus rural) from\nold because consistent prospective data from multiple Indian\nstudies were available from which to estimate MI and stroke risk\namong Indian populations in these age groups [19,20]. We used\nan ``open cohort'' approach, meaning that aging was explicitly\nsimulated between the age groups; new entries into the 40\u00ad49 year\nold age class were incorporated into every time step of the\nsimulation, based on Indian census projections (Figure S1) [21].\nUrban-rural migration was not specifically modeled with a\nseparate variable, but inferred from the Census estimates.\nIn each monthly time step of the model, an individual can be in\none of seven possible states, as depicted in Figure 1: a state with no\nhistory of IHD or stroke; a state of having had an acute MI during\nthat month; a state of having had an acute stroke during that\nmonth; a state of having survived a MI; a state of having survived a\nstroke; a state of having died from either an MI or a stroke; and a\nstate of having died from a non-MI/non-stroke event.\nData sources for transition probabilities\nAs detailed below, the impact of reduced salt on reduced blood\npressure, and reduced blood pressure on the relative risk of MI\nand stroke, were taken from international sources; the baseline risk\nof MI and stroke as well as estimates of blood pressure in each\ncohort were obtained from India-specific sources (see Table 1 for\nparameters, data and sources). Monthly risks of MI and stroke\namong each cohort were taken from a WHO analysis of estimates\namong Indian adults, organized by age, gender and urban versus\nrural location (Table S1) [22]. We incorporated the time-trend in\nthese risks (Table S2), to account for how rates of MI and stroke\nare changing among the population.\nThe risk of recurrent MI/stroke and death from acute MI/\nstroke among each cohort was also adopted from the WHO\nanalysis (Tables S1, S2 and S3) [22]. The risk of death from non-\nMI/non-stroke causes was incorporated in the model using a\nstandard competing risks algorithm [23], which applies cause-\nspecific mortality rates (Table S4) and time-trends in non-MI/non-\nstroke deaths (Table S5) from the WHO to each cohort in the\nmodel [24]. To ensure face validity of the model results, we\ncompared the model's disease-specific mortality estimates against\nindependent estimates of mortality that had not been used as input\ndata sources (Figure S2).\nSalt reduction simulations and underlying assumptions\nTo simulate the impact of salt reduction, we performed a two-\nstage calculation: first, given a particular hypothetical level of\nreduction in salt intake, we estimated how much blood pressure\nwould be reduced (assuming a continuous linear relationship\nbetween salt reduction and blood pressure reduction, as in prior\nmodels, [25,26]); then we estimated how much the relative risk of\nincident MI and stroke would be reduced by this reduction in\nblood pressure. We used the most conservative multi-country\nmeta-analysis data available to estimate the reduction in systolic\nblood pressure from salt reduction [27]; this corresponds to a\namong normotensive persons from a 3 g/day decline in dietary\nsalt intake. Blood pressure among each Indian cohort was taken\nfrom the WHO SAGE study [28], a nationally-representative\nhousehold survey in which blood pressure was established by\nexamination, using the average of three readings (Table S6). The\nSmith-Spangler equations were then used to estimate the age-\nFigure 1. Model diagram. Health states are further divided into age-, gender- and location-specific (urban and rural) submodels. Deaths from non-\ncardiovascular events are calculated from each compartment of the model at each time point in the simulation (not drawn). The transition\nprobabilities between health states in the model are detailed in Tables S1, S2 and S3. Dietary salt reduction in the model lowers the risk of incident\nand recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke events. MI: myocardial infarction.\nSalt and CVD in India\nspecific relative risk reduction for incident MI and stroke from\neach millimeter mercury reduction in systolic pressure [26]; these\nequations (see Text S1) provide estimates of relative risk from a\nmulti-national meta-analysis [19]. Based on a prior review [29],\nwe simulated that stroke risk reduction would be achieved\ngradually at a linear rate over three years, while for myocardial\ninfarctions, two-thirds of the benefit would occur at a linear rate\nover the first three years and the rest would occur at a linear rate\nover the subsequent seven years.\nWe considered a reduction in per capita salt intake of 3 g/\nperson/day achieved over 30 years (at a linear rate of 20.1 g/year\nadditionally ran the model under varying assumptions and\nanalyzed the risk of iodine deficiency associated with dietary salt\nreduction. We conducted further multivariate uncertainty analyses\nto produce confidence intervals around our model's results via\n10,000 simulations in each scenario (Box S1), and varied the salt\nreduction from 1 g to 4 g (Text S1).\nResults\nWithout changes to current levels of dietary salt intake, our\nmodel projects that Indians in the 40 to 69 year old age group will\nexperience an annual rate of approximately 8.3 million new and\non average during each of the next 30 years.\nA population-wide reduction in dietary salt intake of 3 g/day\nachieved over 30 years (at a linear rate of 0.1 g/year, the rate\nachieved in Finland) is projected to reduce the rate of MI by about\nGiven the projected population size of India, this amounts to\nreduction of 1 g/day of dietary salt intake achieved over 30 years\nreduction to 4 g/day achieved over the same 30 year duration is\nBoth sexes and persons in both urban and rural zones were\nlikely to benefit from reductions in salt intake according to our\nmodel (Figure 2). However, the anticipated benefits were largest\namong young urban men. Urban men in the 40 to 49 year old age\ncohort experienced the greatest reduction in the rate of MI\n(28.8%+/22.0). However, the percentage decline in MIs, strokes\nand deaths among all cohorts was within 3% of the changes\namong this young urban male cohort (Table 2), such that all\ngroups received at least a 6.6% decline in events, and the overall\npopulation reduction in MIs was 7.6% (+/21.3%), in strokes was\nTo determine the actual number of averted events in each\ngroup, these percentage declines must be weighted by the absolute\nrate of events and the relative population sizes of each cohort.\nWhen accounting for population size projections and the absolute\nrisk of events in each cohort, the largest number of MIs prevented\nin India would be among urban men in the 50\u00ad59 year cohort\nexperience the greatest number of averted deaths (22,000 deaths\naverted per year, +/25,000). The greatest number of strokes\naverted would be among rural men in the 60\u00ad69 year age cohort\nOverall, rural populations accounted for 27% of averted MIs\naverted deaths from MI or stroke (+/27.6%, Figure 2).

As shown in Figure S4, the number\nof MIs and strokes averted per year increased among all\npopulations with every additional year of the simulation,\nsuggesting that benefits accrue over a long time course.\nIodine deficiency\nUnder a highly-pessimistic set of assumptions (Box S1), a\nreduction in dietary salt intake of 3 grams would be anticipated to\nproduce at most 1,600 new cases of iodine deficiency (defined as\nany low level of blood iodine) that would otherwise be averted\nin iodine deficiency based on current estimates from India [30].\nTable 1.

If salt reduction produced greater blood\npressure reduction for each gram salt reduced (also a relative risk\nmodification, Box S1), as suggested by some clinical trials showing\ngreater salt sensitivity among older persons than younger people\n[31,32], the predicted systolic blood pressure changes would be\nabout four times that of the baseline meta-analysis results (e.g., a\n55 year old urban man would be predicted to experience a\n0.8 mmHg decline in systolic pressure in the baseline scenario for\neach 1gram salt reduction, but a 3.3 mmHg decline in this\noptimistic scenario), and the benefits of salt reduction in the model\ncorrespondingly would increase by approximately a factor of four\nover the baseline simulation (Table 2). Additional sensitivity\nanalyses involving only a 1 g/day salt reduction, or as much as a\n4 g/day salt reduction over 30 years were also performed, and\nshowed essentially linear changes to MI and stroke deaths (Tables\nDiscussion\nUsing a mathematical model of dietary salt intake, blood\npressure and subsequent MI and stroke events in India, we found\nthat dietary salt reduction of 3 grams over 30 years would be\nfrom MI and stroke in India. These reductions correspond to\nbetween 6.6% and 12.3% reductions in the rate of MIs and strokes\namong different subpopulations of the country, averting between\n6.7% and 8.8% of MI and stroke-related deaths. Males, and urban\nmen of working age in particular, would experience the greatest\npredicted benefits from dietary salt reduction. However, the\nbenefits would accrue across both men and women, in both urban\nand rural populations. Over half of strokes, for example, would be\naverted among women, and one out of every three deaths averted\nwould be among rural populations. Only under highly pessimistic\nassumptions would salt reduction at these levels increase risks of\niodine deficiency by ,0.001% percentage point, corresponding to\nBefore analyzing the policy implications of these findings, we\nmust note several important limitations. First, we simulated the\neffects of salt reduction on blood pressure using the most\nconservative meta-analysis results available to date. These studies\nmostly derive from Western nations, but Intersalt and related\nstudies suggest that the relationships between salt and blood\npressure, and between blood pressure and cardiovascular disease\nbeen some studies suggesting that individuals in South Asian\ncommunities might be genetically predisposed to hypertension and\nvarious cardiovascular diseases [34,35]. Although salt intake will\nlikely benefit these individuals, it remains unclear if these persons\nwill see a similar reduction in hypertension and the associated risks\nas the rest of the population; this is a limitation of our predictions.\nTable 2.

MI and stroke incidence includes both new cases and recurrent events.\n*Cardiovascular benefit of lowering blood pressure was equivalent to two-thirds of the benefit for a person whose native blood pressure was at that lower blood\npressure level [42].\n**While the baseline simulation implements the results of a meta-analysis that does not reveal greater salt sensitivity among the elderly [27], we also simulated the case\nin which each gram reduction in salt intake leads to a greater reduction in blood pressure among older cohorts, as per some clinical trials [31,32], in which the change in\nSalt and CVD in India\nSecond, we assumed that the impact of salt reduction on\ncardiovascular disease was linear and entirely mediated by the\nrelationship between salt and blood pressure, although some\nexperts have argued that additional mechanisms may contribute to\nfurther mortality benefits [36] and that the salt-hypertension\nrelationship may be non-linear [31,37] in a direction that would\nrender our results conservative. Additionally, in the UK, a 0.9 g/\nday reduction in salt intake was achieved over 4 years (,0.225 g/\nday per capita per year) [12,38]--more than twice as large as our\nmodeling approach based on the Finnish North Karelia experi-\nence, further suggesting that our baseline model scenario may be\nconservative. Fourth, we focused on the 40 to 69 year old groups\nFigure 2. Impact of salt reduction on cardiovascular events and deaths.

Panel C: Change in deaths from MIs and strokes.\nSalt and CVD in India\ngiven the higher reliability of data available for this age range from\nIndia, the rise of hypertension among young males may indicate\nbenefit in other age cohorts [2]. Fifth, we did not explicitly\nsimulate migration but rather inferred migratory effects using\nIndian Census data; this may limit the applicability of our\nmodel in future years when migration patterns may change.\nFinally, we did not assess ages beyond 40 to 69 years old, or\nadditional diseases related to hypertension such as renal\ndisease or gastric cancer.\nOur model produced estimates of benefit consistent with models\nof salt reduction in Western countries [25,26], suggesting robust\nfindings among independent researchers and alternative models.\nOur model contributes significant new information in that it\ndirectly incorporates new data from a key developing country to\ninvestigate whether salt reduction would accrue benefits outside of\nurban populations eating Western diets, and whether perverse\noutcomes are likely to occur. We included time-trends in MI/\nstroke risk as well as in mortality rates from other diseases (Table\nS2), to account for the rapid change in disease risk over time as\ninfectious disease rates decline and chronic disease rates rise. Our\nresults are highly relevant to other countries, as similar rates of salt\nintake and associated hypertension have been reported in China,\nColombia and Mexico [39]. Given that hypertension has now\nbecome the leading modifiable risk factor for death in the world\n[40], India's path to controlling salt intake may define a paradigm\nfor rapidly-developing countries.\nHowever, the projected benefits in our model were smaller than\none older analysis of salt intake [41], in part because we relied on a\nmore recent meta-analysis [27] estimating a more limited benefit\nof salt reduction (the older analysis used more optimistic studies\npopulation-representative hypertension data, requiring the authors\nto extrapolate data from a small single-locale survey to the entire\nSouth Asian region; we were fortunate to access the WHO SAGE\nstudy to reflect population-representative levels of blood pressure\nand associated risk in both urban and rural regions, stratified by\nage and gender [43].\nPotential unintended consequences, like iodine deficiency, were\nfound to be very small, even under a worst-case scenario\nassuming extremely high iodine requirements and low levels of\niodine intake. Most iodine deficiency in India occurs in areas\nwithout adequate access to iodized salt (not due to inadequate\nintake of iodized salt); reductions in salt intake would therefore\nnot affect the likelihood of iodine deficiency in such areas [44]. In\nsome regions, however, salt is inadequately iodized, such that\ndietary salt reduction could induce new iodine deficiency.\nHowever, we found that because of the minimal amount of\niodine required to meet nutritional needs, dietary salt reduction\nprograms are unlikely to produce substantial new iodine\ndeficiency in such regions, consistent with a recent World Health\nHow to optimally implement salt reduction initiatives in India\nremains unclear. Regulatory interventions such as substituting\npotassium for sodium or reducing ``hidden'' sodium in processed\nfoods may be more effective than educational interventions\n[12,17,47]. While concerns have been raised over the economic\nimpact of regulatory approaches, experience in the UK resulted in\npopulation-wide reduction in dietary salt intake without reduction\nin food product sales, problems with food preservation or\nconsumer complaints about food taste [38]. Further work is being\ninitiated to gather data to study the cost-effectiveness of alternative\nOverall, our findings indicate that moderate reductions in\ndietary salt intake in India, similar to salt reductions achieved in\nWestern populations [10], could substantially reduce cardiovas-\ncular morbidity and mortality in both genders, among both\nmiddle-aged and older age groups, and among both urban and\nrural populations in the country.\nSupporting Information\nBox S1 Additional modeling scenarios.\nFigure S1 Demographic projections for India by age,\ngender and location.\nFigure S2 Face validity of the model compared to\nindependent projections for (A) MI and (B) stroke.\nFigure S3 Iodine content per gram of salt among Indian\nprovinces.\nFigure S4 Number of incident and recurrent MIs,\nstrokes and associated deaths averted over time Given\na Dietary Salt Reduction Target of 3 g/day achieved\nFigure S5 Projected Reductions in Cardiovascular\nEvents Given a Dietary Salt Reduction Target of 1 g/\nday achieved over 30 years.
