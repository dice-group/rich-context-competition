    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Social Compass Curriculum (SCC) was investigated for its effectiveness in improving core social skills in three descriptive\ncase studies of students with autism. Treatment fidelity of the SCC was also measured in the school setting. The Social\nResponsiveness Scale and the Autism Social Skills Profile were completed by parents to measure pre- and postintervention\nsocial skills for three students aged 8 to 11 years who participated in the present multisite pilot study. Fidelity of implementation\ndata were collected via a checklist during observations for three educators who implemented the intervention. Results\nindicate that the SCC improved core social deficits based on standardized rating scales measures. Fidelity observations\nrevealed that 83% of teaching components were completed correctly after 3 hr of training. The results of this study aligned\nwith the National Autism Center's call for ongoing research of school-based interventions and school-friendly interventions\nfor people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\n",

Although the definition of social skills is not undis-\nputed in the autism community, its description typically\nencompasses perspective taking, joint attention, social prag-\nmatics, social reciprocity, linguistic conventions, and appro-\npriate emotional affect. Social deficits in ASD have\nsignificant consequences; people with ASD tend to be iso-\nlated in social environments, especially in a mainstreamed\nWhite, Keonig, & Scahill, 2007). Social isolation, particu-\nlarly for adolescents, has been implicated as a possible cause\nfor secondary manifestations of psychiatric illness in indi-\nviduals with ASD later in life (Hurtig et al., 2009; White et\nal., 2007). Research suggests that the lack of social involve-\nment for youth with ASD leads to serious long-term mental\nhealth consequences that exasperate social deficits. During\nschool years, these students may frustrate their teacher's\nability to manage a classroom of students with mixed abili-\nties, which can lead to the individual with ASD being moved\ninto more restrictive environments where positive social\nmodels may not exist. The current special educational para-\ndigm involves the adherence to full inclusion for all students\nto the highest degree possible. Students with autism can pose\nunique challenges to a classroom teacher especially due to\nbehaviors resulting from a lack of social competence. They\ndo not learn social skills incidentally or vicariously in the\nsame manner as their nondisabled peers, or even persons\nwith other disabilities (Volkmar, 1993). As such, these stu-\ndents often behave in a manner, which may draw negative\nattention from others or cause avoidance by neurotypical\npeers. In addition, they may find others unpredictable and\ntherefore difficult to interact with due to their failure to fol-\nlow rigid routines or structures utilized by the person with\nASD. The crux for the classroom teacher is to create a learn-\ning environment that will work for all students and avoids\ncrisis management due to problem behaviors. In other words,\neducators need to reduce the potential for challenging behav-\niors before they arise rather than focus on contingency plans\nfor managing behaviors once they occur (Marks et al., 2003).\nBased on the fact that poorly formed social skills is a com-\nmon attribute across the spectrum of autism disorders,\ndirectly teaching social skills is a proactive strategy teachers\n1NOC SELPA, Fullerton, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: louanneboyd@gmail.com\nSocial Compass Curriculum: Three\nDescriptive Case Studies of Social Skills\nOutcomes for Students With Autism\nLouAnne E.

Time is\nprobably a teacher's most precious commodity. Therefore, a\nsocial skills program used by teachers needs to be easy to\nimplement, adaptable to unique student characteristics, and\neffective. Individuals with ASD are most likely to be recep-\ntive to social skills programs that consist of routine struc-\ntures, provide alternate modes of completing assignments,\nuse visual cues, provide mnemonic devices, and nonverbal\ncues (Marks et al., 2003). Programs that are provided to a\nwhole class of students assist in creating a common language\nin the classroom for social behaviors, helping all students\nunderstand components of positive social interactions. This\nmay help facilitate positive interactions between people with\nASD and other students. In addition, Sansosti, in a guide for\nschool-based professionals, states,\n. . . to be most effective, school-based efforts aimed at enhancing\nthe social skill development of individuals with ASD should be\nconducted by using a systematic approach. That is, social skill\ninterventions should focus on a combination of school-wide,\nsmall group, and individualized supports. (Sansosti, 2010,\nCurrent social skills interventions approach the problem\nfrom an environmental standpoint as well as intra-individually.\nEnvironmental interventions aim to alter the setting by work-\ning with other students and creating a physical environment\nthat facilitates social interactions. These include The Circle\nof Friends Program (Frederickson & Turner, 2003) and Peer\nBuddies (Roeyers, 1996), which work with typically devel-\noped students to form facilitated friendships between stu-\ndents with ASD and neurotypical peers. These interventions\nhave positive anecdotal effects for all young people involved\n(National Autism Center, 2009). However, the positive\nimpact of these environmental interventions does not con-\ntinue when a person with ASD leaves his or her school site or\nreaches adulthood. Orsmond, Krauss, and Seltzer (2004)\nreviewed social relationships among adults with autism and\nfound that nearly 50% of the adults with ASD reported no\nsocial interactions outside prearranged group activities.\nMoreover, the same study found that reciprocal friendships\nexisted for only 8% of adults with ASD when prearranged\nsocial outings were not provided. These findings corrobo-\nrated the low rate of friendships reported in other studies\nand helped reveal the unfortunate fate for many people with\nASD who age-out of school and lose facilitated social inter-\nactions. The absence of structured friendships for these\nadults explains the profound loneliness and isolation lead-\ning to the onset of psychiatric behavioral problems that may\nfurther restrict access to community life (Ghaziuddin,\ndetail, social isolation and resultant psychiatric behavior\nproblems further diminish a person with ASD's ability to\nengage in the community at large, thus creating an immea-\nsurable fissure between sound mental health and mental\nillness. This means that young people with autism need to\nlearn skills rather than depend fully on changes to their\nenvironment.\nThere is a shortage of evidence-based social skills curri-\ncula available to teachers of students with ASD, while at the\nsame time educators are experiencing the striking rise in the\noccurrence of children with autism. The current estimate for\nautism prevalence is 1 in 88 for all children and 1 in 54 for\nmale children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nIndividuals with ASD are no longer rare in classrooms and\ntheir needs are painfully obvious to any educator. The\nNational Autism Center's large-scale project, National\nStandards Project, seeks to objectively articulate evidence-\nbased thematic intervention approaches for ASD rather than\nendorse particular curriculums or programs. This project\ncalls for the use of established and emerging interventions\nfor people with ASD and for educators to conduct scientifi-\ncally meaningful research to further establish interventions\nfor this population. Krasny, Williams, Provencal, and\nOzonoff (2003) argue that fundamental skills needed are:\nnonverbal skills, emotional awareness, conversation skills,\nand social problem solving. The Social Compass Curriculum\nis a story-based intervention; as such it uses an instructional\nmethodology cited among the established practices accord-\ning to the National Standards report (NationalAutism Center,\n2009). Furthermore, the SCC intervention meets the need for\nschools to be the place where the majority of intervention\noccurs for young people with ASD. The SCC was initiated in\nthe schools after collaboration with educators, parents, and\nspecialists; the first edition of the SCC was implemented\nin 2002. The SCC has its foundation in a story-based\nintervention that focuses on four key areas: Nonverbal\nCommunication, Emotions, \"We\" Skills, and Social Problem\nSolving. Each lesson consists of a story relating a particular\nsocial problem, a visual aid, facilitator modeling of success-\nful behavior to remedy the social problem, student role-\nplaying, student self-reflection, and a letter to the home to\nenhance generalization of learned skills. In 2011, a poster\nwas presented at the California Association of School\nPsychologists presenting data reflecting that educators found\nthe SCC very effective for teaching social skills to students\nwith autism within a school setting (Boyd, McClelland, &\nFlowers, 2011). These findings were based on an online\nanonymous, nine-item Likert-type scale, wherein 100 educa-\ntors who attended a training on the SCC were invited to\nrespond. These educators worked within one suburban\nSpecial Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) including ele-\nmentary, middle, high school, and adult transition grade lev-\nels. Of the 100 educators invited to participate in the survey,\n18 responded. The highest percentage of respondents repre-\nsented educators who work with students whose disabilities\nrange from mild to moderate and whose educational place-\nment was in special day class. The majority of the students\nBoyd and Ward 3\nwere reported to function within the first to sixth grade level.\nSixty percent of respondents reported that they were able to\nimplement the SCC in their classrooms \"pretty well\" which\nwas reported via the following scale: 1 = not well, 2 = some-\nwhat well, 3 = pretty well, 4 = very well. Due to anonymity of\nthe survey, the researchers were not able to determine the\nnumber of hours of training the educators had prior to imple-\nmentation. The results may be biased toward individuals\nwho had positive relationships with the creators of this cur-\nriculum and thus took the time to respond to the survey.\nHowever, this preliminary data suggest that students who\nfunction between the first and sixth grade levels were able to\naccess the curriculum in a school setting, while the actual\ngrade level of the students is unknown. Based on preliminary\ndata, it appears that students who function at the elementary\ngrade levels can benefit from the SCC and that their teachers\nfound they could use the SCC \"pretty well\" in a school set-\nThe current research aims to answer two research\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1: Does the SCC improve social\nskills per parental rating scales?\nResearch Question 2: Can educators implement the SCC\nwith fidelity after approximately 3 hr of training?\nIn the present study, fidelity was measured via direct\nobservation by the trainer using a checklist to describe how\nwell teachers are able to follow the structure of the SCC in a\ntypical school setting. Fidelity is an important component of\nASD intervention research since it ensures that the interven-\ntion was implemented as prescribed and allows the practitio-\nner to estimate how applicable a particular intervention will\nbe in a typical classroom environment (Sansosti, 2010).\nMethod\nThe present study utilized a descriptive case studies design\nfor analysis of student social skills development in three stu-\ndents with ASD. Two public school sites were invited to\nparticipate, representing two different educator facilitators.\nThe SCC trainer conducted fidelity of implementation obser-\nvations across the implementation of the intervention phase\nof the study. See Table 1.\nExperimental Intervention\nThe independent variable for this study was the Social\nCompass Curriculum: A Story-Based Intervention Package\nfor Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (Boyd,\nMcReynolds, & Chanin, 2013). It follows recommendations\nput forth by Krasny et al. (2003), \"fundamentals . . . such as\nnonverbal communication and affect recognition need to be\npracticed in a group setting\" (p. 108). Areas of social skills\nthat are addressed in the 24-lesson curriculum include:\nNonverbal Skills, Emotions, \"We\" Skills, and Social Problem\nSolving. Each lesson incorporates the comprehensive com-\nponents outlined by Krasny et al. (2003) and Marks et al.\n(2003) such as: defined goals, visual supports, a narrative of\na social challenge, teacher modeling, rehearsal, role-play,\nfeedback, reinforcement via self-monitoring, and a take-\nhome letter to encourage generalization of skills. All instruc-\ntional components of the SCC lessons encompass skills that\na classroom teacher or service provider already has in his or\nher collection of classroom techniques. Each SCC lesson can\nbe completed in approximately 40 min with a group of stu-\ndents. The 8 lessons of the SCC lessons were presented to\ngroups of students within a pull out social skills group. The\nintervention was delivered by California credentialed educa-\ntors who received 3 hr of training prior to and brief consulta-\ntion during the intervention.\nEthics Statement\nInformed consent was obtained from minor students' parents\nfor student participation in a school-based social skills cur-\nriculum, collection of survey data, and presentation of data in\nthe form of a research paper. Consent to conduct research at\nschool sites was approved by a committee of administrators\nrepresenting the various school districts, the Special\nTable 1.

Students were given\nthe opportunity to assent to the intervention as well as to vol-\nuntarily withdraw from the intervention. No financial offer-\ning or gifts were provided to the parents of the students or to\nthe students for participation. The educator participants were\nprovided a free SCC manual that they were allowed to keep.\nParticipants\nThe focus of this investigation was on students with ASD\nwho were provided intervention with the SCC. The three stu-\ndents evaluated had educational designations of Autistic-\nLike Behaviors determined by school personnel. The\nparticipants aged from 8 to 11 years attended one of two pub-\nlic elementary schools in a suburban area of Southern\nCalifornia experienced the SCC intervention. Demographics\nof three students studied with ASD consisted of two male\nstudents and one female student. All three students attend\npublic elementary school in a fully included general educa-\ntion environment without the assistance of an adult aide. All\nstudents are able to access grade-level academics indepen-\ndently. The three students would be described as individuals\nwith high functioning autism based on their ability to access\ngrade-level general education academics. However, these\nstudents showed social impairments with T-scores about 76\non the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). The three stu-\ndents studied were provided the SCC intervention as a pull\nout designated service per their individualized education\nprogram. See Table 2.\nThree public educators were observed to measure fidelity\nof treatment. Two were California credentialed special edu-\ncation teachers and one was a California licensed speech and\nlanguage pathologist. See Table 3.\nProcedures\nThe first month of the study, teachers attended a 3-hr training\nusing a PowerPoint that described the research components'\nrationale and corresponding strategy present in each lesson.\nEach of the five steps to a lesson was described in detail with\nseveral examples provided from the text. The original of the\nvisual supports and how to give feedback was role-played\nwith the participants. At the onset and conclusion of the\nstudy, social skills rating scales were provided to parents or\nguardians of students with designated ASD.\nNext, the social skill groups were assembled. Male A par-\nticipated with Teacher B (speech) in a mixed group of four\nstudents who were pulled out of their general education\nplacement for designated speech services in one public ele-\nmentary school. Male B and Female A participated with\nTeacher A (RSP) in a mixed group of five students who were\npulled out of their general education placement in the second\npublic elementary school.\nDuring the intervention phase, the SCC trainer measured\nfidelity of the intervention using a data collection system com-\nposed of a checklist. The trainer observed the entire lesson and\nchecked off the presence or absence of each step of the lesson\nlisted in Table 1. Targeted observations were scheduled once\nevery 1 to 2 weeks to achieve an adequate measure for treatment\nintegrity, 10 of 33 sessions were observed. See Table 4.\nAt each observation, data were collected on the educators'\nimplementation of the comprehensive components of each les-\nson. Total observations may have included parts of a single les-\nson as Teacher A and B provided intervention twice a week for\n20 min and Teacher C met once a week for 45 min. Teacher A\nand B used small pull-out groups and Teacher C worked with\nthe whole class of students in a special day class (SDC) with\nmoderate disabilities. The SDC teacher modified the curriculum\nby summarizing the social narrative and replacing the self-\nmonitoring with whole group feedback as the students'attention\nto these aspects was poor. The SDC teacher found it useful to\nuse two sessions per lesson for whole class instruction.\nSocial Skills Measures\nMost rating scales are given at the beginning of a study and can\nbe used for follow-up measures (Sansosti, 2010). Two rating\nscales were chosen to be completed by parents for this study.\nThe SRS as it is believed to have the potential to be sensitive to\ntreatment changes in children with autism spectrum disorder\nBellini (Sansosti, 2010). The authors provide mean changes on\nsocial skills measures as well as qualitative case descriptions for\nthe effect of the SCC for three students with ASD.\nSocial Responsiveness Scale\nThe Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-item rating\nscale based on a normative sample of 1,600 children from 4\nTable 2.

This rating scale prescribes to mea-\nsure emotionally appropriate social interactions of individu-\nals who may have ASD. According to Constantino et al.\n(2003), the SRS provides a .7 correlation with the Autism\nDiagnostic Interview\u00adRevised and the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV;\nAPA, 1994) in its ability to identify autism and a .8 interrater\nreliability. The SRS designates ASD by evaluating the indi-\nvidual's social interactions without regard for intellectual\ncapacity. This scale is described as appropriate for research\npursuits due to its brief administration, approximately\n15 min, and its linkage to current theories. It is designed to be\ncompleted by an adult, a teacher, or parent. Subscales on the\nSRS include social awareness, social cognition, social com-\nmunication, social motivation, and autistic mannerisms.\nThe SRS was selected for its ability to quickly identify\naspects of social skills present before and after the SCC\nintervention and for confirmation of identified participant\nASD status. The SRS was sent to the participant's parent via\nthe SCC facilitator. The parent independently completed the\nrating scale as a survey without the assistance of the facilita-\ntor or the researcher. The researcher scored the rating scale\naccording to the manual and analyzed the scores at the over-\nall level, domain level, and item level.\nAutism Social Skills Profile\nThe Autism Social Skills Profile (ASSP) is a scale developed\nto measure social functioning in individuals with ASD and\nspecifically to facilitate progress monitoring through an\nintervention process. The preliminary psychometric analysis\nwas conducted with mothers representing 93% of respon-\ndents, then fathers (3%), grandparents at 2% and other as last\n2% (Bellini & Hopf, 2007).The ASSP ascribes to measure\nthree domains: social reciprocity, social participation/avoid-\nance, and detrimental social behaviors. The ASSP utilizes a\n4-point Likert-type scale for each of the 49 items and can be\ncompleted by parents or teachers in approximately 15 to 20\nminutes. Bellini and Hopf (2007) analyzed the psychometric\nproperties of the ASSP finding the internal consistency\non the sample. Test\u00adretest reliability was .904 for the entire\nsample and factor loading was low (.09 to .36) suggesting the\nmeasure identifies distinct factors. The ASSP was sent home\nto the participant's parent by the SCC facilitator; the parent\nindependently completed the rating scale as a survey without\nthe assistance of the facilitator or the researcher. The ASSP\nwas scored using instructions provided by the authors and\nwas analyzed at the overall, domain, and item level.\nThe tool was designed to monitor progress on social skill\ninterventions for students with autism. Bellini and Hopf\n(2007) reported parents of students with intellectual disabil-\nity scores between 67 and 161, students with autism scored\nbetween 67 and 177, and students identified as high func-\ntioning autism scored between 70 and 177. Bellini and Hopf\n(2007) reported the mean score for high functioning students\nwith autism as 109.83. A group if individuals with intellec-\ntual disabilities or severe language deficits had a mean score\nTable 4.

This instrument did not provide cutoff scores but\nrather ranges of scores related to severity of impairment.\nResults\nFidelity data collected by the SCC trainer is displayed in\nTable 1. Key components of the intervention were monitored\nwhile the teacher implemented the SCC with a mixed group\nof students. All Teachers successfully stated the goal of the\nlesson. Teacher A (RSP) and Teacher B (Speech) read the\nsocial narrative aloud at each observation point. Teacher C\n(SDC) did not read the short story aloud straight through\nfrom beginning to end when the observer was present.\nInstead this teacher adapted the story to address the student's\nattention span and unique needs using gestures to act out\nstory as she went along. All teachers modeled skills, allowed\nfor student rehearsal, and provided feedback to students.\nStudent self monitoring was an area of difficulty; Teacher B\n(speech) was observed as presenting the self monitoring\naspect of the SCC half of the time and Teacher C (SDC) did\nnot implement the student self monitoring component of the\nlessons when observed by the trainer. The self-monitoring\ncomponent of the Social Compass Curriculum was the big-\ngest challenge to all three groups and required teachers to\nprompt students to complete the self-monitoring tasks. To\nteach students to self-monitor, the teacher is expected to pro-\nvide prompting initially and continue until students are inde-\npendent and accurate with the task. Without therapist\ncoaching provided and after fidelity observations, teachers\nreported they would be likely to stop implementing this step.\nOverall Teacher A (RSP) implemented the SCC with 100%\nfidelity. Teacher B (speech) implemented the SCC with 86%\nfidelity. Teacher C (SDC) implemented the SCC with 72%\nfidelity.\nSocial Skills Measures\nSocial Responsiveness Scale\nTwo of three participants with ASD returned the pre- and\npost-tests for the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) fully\ncompleted; one participant (Female A) returned a partially\ncompleted posttest rating scale. The SRS generates T-scores\nwith a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 based on a\nbelow suggests normal range; T-60 to T-75 indicates mild to\nmoderate range; and T-76 or higher represents severe range\nAll participants for pre- and post-tests had T-scores in the\nsevere range and corroborates the identification of partici-\npant ASD. A comparison of pretest and posttest total scores\nfor the SRS shows that the post-test yielded an average T-85\nversus an average pre-test of T-89 with a -4.49 mean percent\nchange. The standard error of measure (SEM) on the SRS is\n2.4 for male children and 2.6 for female children. The\nnumeric difference of T-scores from pre- to post-test for\nindividual students as well as the average T-score numeric\ndifference was greater than the SEM for the testing instru-\nment, which suggests that the changes in T-scores were\ngreater than the degree of natural fluctuation in the instru-\nment's sensitivity. See Table 5.\nItem level Analysis for Participants--SRS\nParental rating of participants' pre- and post-intervention\nwere evaluated at the item level to provide progress monitor-\ning data. The SRS rating scale employs the following Likert-\ntype scale: 1 = not true, 2 = sometimes true, 3 = often true, 4\n= almost always true. Items that directly relate to social func-\ntioning were reviewed and areas of change are reported\nbelow for each single case studied. See Table 6.\nMale A had the greatest number of socially related items\non the SRS that improved. At the same time this individual\nstudent also had a T-score of 90+ at baseline. He improved in\nmultiple aspects of social communication such as making\neye contact and matching his facial expressions with what he\nis communicating. Male A, according to parental observa-\ntions, improved his tendency to interact with other people as\nindicated by SRS prompts: does not join activities unless told\nto do so, appears to avoid starting social interactions with\npeers or adults, and has difficulty making friends, even when\ntrying his best. See Table 7.\nMale B improved on four items related to social skills.\nHis parent's responses on the SRS indicated improvement in\nthe area of understanding that others have feelings or think-\ning, a measure of perspective taking. He was noted as being\nable to imitate the actions of others more often after the SCC\nintervention and was noted as offering comfort to others\nwhen sad to a greater degree after the intervention. Male B\nwas observed as thinking and talking about the same thing,\nwhich may describe rigid interests, to a lesser degree after\nthe SCC intervention.\nFemale A improved on six items of the SRS that relate to\nsocial competency. Female A's parent reported improve-\nments in her ability to take turns during social interactions,\nmaintaining eye contact, and offering comfort to others when\nsad. Her parent also reported that she plays appropriately\nwith children her age to a greater degree and is less likely to\nbe regarded as odd or weird by other children. Lastly, Female\nA's parent noted that she was not observed as taking things\nTable 5.

The study began in January, sessions began in\nMarch, sessions ended in early June and post intervention\nwas collected in June before the school year concluded. The\nASSP was reported as being appropriate for monitoring of\nprogress for social skills interventions; higher total scores for\nsocial functioning represents more positive social behaviors\n(Bellini & Hopf, 2007).

See Table 11.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study at least partially answer the research\nquestion as to whether parents of individuals studied with\nASD would note improvements in core social skills.\nCombined parental pre- and post-measures using the ASSP\nshowed that indicators of social reciprocity by querying\naspects of social exchange, such as maintaining the \"give\nand take\" of conversations, responding to questions directed\nat him or her, taking turns during a game, acknowledging\nothers' interests, and joining a conversation without\ninterrupting (Bellini & Hopf, 2007, p. 85) improved from the\nbaseline after approximately eight to nine lessons through\nthe 6-month period of the case studies on the SCC interven-\ntion. Comparison of averaged pre- and posttest results\nrevealed an increase in social functioning of 16% change,\nwith an average pretest score of 100 and an average posttest\nscore of 116. When individual items were analyzed for the\nthree students with ASD, there was an overlap in parental\nperception of improvement for interacting with peers in\nunstructured activities for all three students. The fact that all\nthree parents observed their child interacting with others dur-\ning unstructured activities is a major gain for these youths as\nunplanned interactions with peers is known to be an aspect of\nsocial interaction that is particularly difficult for people with\nautism who often seek interactions that are controlled by\nadults (Orsmond et al., 2004). The SCC includes multiple\nlessons that directly teach individuals the mechanics of social\ninteractions; moreover, the use of peer role-plays integrates a\nrange of interpretations by students in which the student with\nASD can observe and learn appropriate responses.\nThe Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) supports out-\ncome analysis of emotionally appropriate social interactions\nof people with ASD. The SRS has an additional function of\nassisting in the identification of people with ASD. In this\nregard, the SRS provided a dual purpose: first, to measure\ndifferences in congruency of emotional response to social\ninteractions pre and post, and second, to confirm that partici-\npants noted in the study as havingASD were correctly identi-\nfied. The SRS provides T-score designations of functional\nlevel; a T-score of 59 or below is considered normal range,\nTable 9.

All participants exhibited\nT-scores greater than 76, indicating a high probability of\nASD. T-scores for all participants decreased after exposure\nto the SCC intervention. The average percentage change was\n-4.49 with an average difference of 4 for T-score results. All\noutcome measures were above the cutoff for standard error\nof measure, suggesting changes were greater than natural\nfluctuations in scores innate to the SRS. For the participants\nin this study, the item analysis of the SRS showed improve-\nment in social skills as it relates to emotional appropriateness\nof the situation while participant T-scores remained within\nthe severe range. This finding suggests that the pivotal skills\nof emotional awareness and social problem solving may\nhave improved after exposure to the SCC.\nWhen individual items were evaluated for the three students\nwithASD, there was overlap on two items between MaleAand\nFemale A and Male B and Female A. Items where there was\nshared improvement across participants were using more typi-\ncal eye contact and offering comfort to others when sad. The\nSCC offers students the opportunity to practice effective con-\nversational behaviors, which include facing one's conversa-\ntional partner and this repeated practice may have improved the\nchildren's tendency to offer eye contact. Emotional understand-\ning represents a unit of lessons in the SCC including identifying\nemotions based on facial expressions and discerning emotional\nintensity in others. Appropriate responses to other's emotions\nare presented in a social narrative, modeled by the facilitator,\nrole played by the student, and then considered by peer review\nas well as self-reflection. At face value it appears that the SCC\nwould teach emotional understanding in such a way that\nimprovements may be accepted as actual changes in the child\nwithASD's understanding of how to interact with a person who\nis sad by offering comfort.\nSpecific topics covered during the course of the SCC\nintervention were reading body language, using proximity to\ncommunicate intent to communicate, using volume and tone\nof voice to communicate in expected fashion with peers,\nusing social referencing to communicate intent to interact\nwith group, and using appropriate intensity of emotions to\nmatch the emotional intensity of the social situation. Methods\nfor teaching include providing an adult-generated model,\nimitating model (rehearsal), adult and peer feedback of cor-\nrect and incorrect examples of behavior, student role-\nplaying, allowing peer-mediated feedback, and last, student\nself-monitoring. In addition, each lesson included a parent\nsend home letter to describe the content of the lesson and\nencourage parental praise of desired behaviors--a practice to\nencourage generalization and maintenance of learned behav-\niors. The inclusion of a parent letter describing the content of\neach lesson may have caused the parents to inflate their rat-\nings on measures of social skills due to directing the parent's\nattention to particular social skills. Although this practice\nmay have inflated parental responses, this possibility is\nviewed as a positive attribute, because this would mean that\nthe parents were attending to positive behaviors to a greater\ndegree than prior to the SCC intervention. Praise of prosocial\nbehaviors by parents would predict repetition of those behav-\niors by the children, assuming the children desire parental\nattention, and thus would possibly increase those behaviors\nin multiple environments which may influence generaliza-\ntion as well as maintenance of learned skills.\nPreviously presented research revealed that a group of 18\neducators found that they were able to implement the SCC\npretty well with limited training (Boyd et al., 2011). To be\nuseful, an intervention benefits from a format that reduces\ninterventionist's vigilance (Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, &\nCarter, 1999a).Apredictable routine in an intervention aligns\nwith strengths of people with ASD in adhering to routines\ncommon structure to each lesson while addressing new con-\ncepts, thus providing needed routines which lessen interven-\ntionist vigilance. For a teacher, this would likely improve\nfidelity as well as satisfaction with the SCC. Moreover, stu-\ndent motivation was noted by Krasny as being related to stu-\ndent perceived relevance of the instructed social skills, and\nwas reported as being enhanced by story-based lessons\n(Krasny et al., 2003). Each SCC lesson includes a vignette of\na particular social problem wherein the protagonist of the\nstory solves his or her social problem. The SCC social narra-\ntives serve a dual purpose: to provide relevance to the skills\ntaught as well as providing an explicit example of a social\nproblem and how the problem can be solved.\nThe SCC is an intervention that educators were able to use\nwith fidelity; educators reported that students could partici-\npate in it easily, and it stated teaching procedures clearly.\nThis is especially important with regard to current political\neducational mandates that educators must apply differenti-\nated teaching for individuals with ASD. For example, state\nmandates in California require special educators to obtain\nadditional credentialing, an autism authorization, to teach\nstudents with autism. The need for school-friendly effective\ninterventions are timely and of paramount importance.\nTable 11.

Those single-case research designs that included N > 9,\nincluded well-designed experimental procedures, a treatment\nmanual, fully described participants, and compared the treat-\nment with another treatment or condition were deemed well\nestablished. Single case studies that included N > 3 and met the\nsame criteria as noted earlier were described as probably effica-\ncious. This research did not meet the standards for \"probably\nefficacious\" based on the APA's criteria on multiple levels.\nAlthough a series of three case studies were presented and had\nsome areas of common findings, the number was not greater\nthan three. A treatment or intervention manual was available to\nthe facilitators and did result in strong fidelity for the implemen-\ntation of the SCC intervention for the students with ASD who\nwere reported here, but the students'single cases were not com-\npared with another treatment or a control condition. The experi-\nmental design of pre- to post-test is not as strong as other single\ncase designs such as ABA (baseline, intervention, removal of\nintervention) due to the nature of an intervention that includes\nlearning which is impossible to remove once gained by the par-\nticipants. Possible confounds to the findings in this study include\npossible inflation of parental responses due to knowledge of the\ncontent of lessons taught with the SCC as well as potential\ndesire to report positive results due to parental relationships\nwith the facilitators of SCC or the author of the SCC.\nThe gold standard of research, the fully randomized clini-\ncal trials as used in medical research, is far from the portrayal\nof data here, and it is well known that educational research\noften falls short of the ultimate goal (Odom et al., 2005). In\nan evaluation of research in special education, it was noted\nthat special education research is particularly complex due to\nheterogeneity of participant characteristics and the contin-\nuum of educational placements which makes the creation of\nequivalent groups with large enough sample sizes very dif-\nficult to obtain or infeasible (Odom et al., 2005).\nThis study does provide preliminary data that helped\ndetermine which rating scales possessed the specificity\nneeded to measure small changes after the SCC intervention;\nthe Social Responsiveness Scale and the ASSP yielded\nchanges pre- and post-intervention. Moreover, parental\nobservations of improvement were noted in several items on\nthe SRS and ASSP some of which overlapped which suggest\nthat changes may have been due to more than chance. Face\nvalidity applies when one compares items wherein students\nbehaviors changed align well with social skills directly\ntaught during the SCC intervention.\nMaintenance of social capacity is another area wherein\nthe present study did not provide solid evidence and is thus a\nfertile area of research. In the future, a social rating scale\ncould be provided to parents and teachers well after the SCC\nintervention occurred to determine whether participants\nmaintained skills beyond the active intervention phase. At\npresent, teachers need as many classroom-based social skills\ninterventions as possible to address the unique needs of indi-\nviduals with ASD, and small studies with preliminary results\nassist in meeting this need. The SCC does align well with\nrecommended procedures indicated by the National Autism\nCenter (2009). In addition, teachers who used the SCC\nreported that the intervention was easy to follow and that the\nintervention appeared to work well for students (Boyd et al.,\nStudents who participated in the SCC were reported to\nengage in unstructured peer interactions to a higher degree\nbased on parental observations after the SCC than before the\nintervention. It is suspected that if these youths with ASD\ncontinue this practice that social reinforcement will aid in\nthese youths continuing this practice which may reduce the\npotential for future isolation known to occur in those people\nwith ASD after school-aged activities cease (Orsmond et al.,\nThe ultimate goal for full integration of individuals with\nASD into the least restrictive environment is to provide a\nmechanism for all students to develop an understanding of\npersonal differences and develop a way to successfully inter-\nact socially. It is believed that any social skills intervention\nthat enhances this possibility is useful for students.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: The authors declare the potential conflict of interest related\nto one of the author's creation of the Social Compass Curriculum.\nNo financial gain has been experienced and the curriculum has been\nmade available to schools, for 10 years prior to publication, free of\ncharge.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
