This shows that we should attach great impor-\ntance to how reading is viewed as a skill by learners.\nAlexander and Filler (1976) define reading attitudes as \"a\nsystem of feelings related to reading which causes the learner\nto approach or avoid a reading situation\" (p. l). Understanding\nthe role of readers' attitudes is important in that attitude may\naffect the level of ability ultimately attained by a given stu-\ndent through influencing factors such as engagement and\npractice. Attitudes toward reading are formed through past\nexperiences related to reading, educational background, cul-\ntural belief, and success and failure in reading (Day &\nfound that positive attitudes turn negative as children get\nolder. This is more evident in children who experience diffi-\nculty in reading. Therefore, success or failure in reading is\naffected by reading attitudes.\nIn addition, cultural norms, values, and expectations are\namong other factors affecting reading attitudes. For example,\ngirls have been found to be better readers than boys\n(McKenna et al., 1995). This can be associated with cultural\nexpectations individuals have formed in society regarding\ntheir gender. There are many studies reporting more positive\nattitudes in females than males (Logan & Johnston, 2009;\nanother study, McKenna, Conradi, Lawrence, Jang, and\nMeyer (2012) found that females reported more positive atti-\ntudes for academic reading while males reported more posi-\ntive attitudes toward recreational readings. This shows that\ntext type and genre also influence reading attitude. Different\nreading attitudes may be observed in different sociocultural\ncontexts.\nHowever, the literature reveals inconsistent results regard-\ning the relationship between reading attitude and reading\nachievement. Martinez, Aricak, and Jewell (2008) investi-\ngated the relationship between reading attitude, reading abil-\nity, and reading achievement among 76American elementary\nchildren. The findings showed that both reading ability and\nreading attitudes significantly predicted reading achieve-\nment. Lazarus and Callahan (2000) measured reading atti-\ntudes among children with learning disabilities and found\nthat they had favorable reading attitudes. They concluded\n1Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nBehzad Ghonsooly, Department of English, Faculty of Letters and\nEmail: ghonsooly@um.ac.ir\nAttitude Toward Reading: L1 or L2 or\nBoth\nHadi Akbari1, Behzad Ghonsooly1, Mohammad Ghazanfari1,\nand Hesamodin Shahriari1\n Keywords\nL2 reading, L1 reading, attitude, foreign language learning, reading achievement, foreign languages, language studies, humanities,\nlanguage teaching, applied linguistics, linguistics\n2 SAGE Open\nthat attitude may not be associated with reading ability. In\nanother study, it was reported that more able readers had\nmore positive attitudes toward reading (Wigfield & Asher,\nreaders with positive attitudes kept their positive attitudes\ndespite experiencing challenges with reading. Interestingly,\nreading attitudes generally decline as individuals advance in\nschool.\nMost of the studies mentioned above deal with L1 reading\nattitudes while research on L2 reading attitudes has been the\nconcern of several researchers (e.g., Camiciottoli, 2001; Day\ninvestigated the relationship between the L1 and L2 reading\nstrategy used and how beliefs about L1 reading affect L2 read-\ning behavior among four L2 college readers of Spanish and\nEnglish. She concluded that students' beliefs about home lan-\nguage and reading affect their behavior. For instance, those\nwho viewed their L1 as an asset translated L2 reading into\ntheir native language purposefully. She believes that more\nresearch is needed to examine the relationships between\nbeliefs about reading and reading processes. In a study by\nYamashita (2004) on 59 Japanese university students, the find-\nings showed that reading attitudes are generally transferable\nbetween first and second languages but with different transfer-\nability degree. She identified four variables for reading atti-\ntude (comfort, anxiety, value, and self-perception), with the\nvalue (what person thinks) as a variable more transferable than\ncomfort, anxiety, or self-perception (what person feels). She\nconcluded that merely thinking that reading is beneficial does\nnot bring enough motivation to read. Her study demonstrated\nthe importance of reading attitude (particularly how one feels\nabout reading attitude both in L1 and L2) in improving L2\nreader's involvement. In a later study, Yamashita (2007) inves-\ntigated the transfer of reading attitudes from L1 to L2 in\nJapanese students and found that Japanese students had differ-\nent L1 and L2 reading attitudes. Regression analysis indicated\nthat a significant proportion of L2 attitudes could be explained\nby L1 reading attitude. Yamashita (2007) warned against the\ngeneralizability of the findings due to English as a Foreign\nLanguage (EFL) context of Japan and also several method-\nological limitations of the study.\nAlthough no accurate report has been released regarding\nthe amount of reading done by Iranians, a few reports point\nto the inadequate amount of reading done by young Iranians.\nSome have reported an amount of reading between 6 and 7\nmin per day while another reports 7 min of reading per day.\nA variety of factors can be associated to this little amount of\nreading among which can be attitude toward reading. The\npresent study is another attempt to shed more light on the\nrole of L1 and L2 reading attitudes as represented in the fol-\nlowing research questions:\nResearch Question 1: Is there any significant relation-\nship between L1 and L2 reading attitudes of Iranian\nstudents?\nResearch Question 2: Does L1 reading attitude predict\nL2 reading attitude of Iranian students?\nResearch Question 3: Do L1 and L2 reading attitudes\npredict L2 reading achievement of Iranian students?\nTo find answers to the above research questions, the follow-\ning methodological issues were taken into account.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants of the study included 230 male and female\nEnglish language learners studying at various language\ninstitutes in the North Khorasan province of Iran. Most were\naged between 18 and 28 years and had a variety of education\nlevels. Based on the results of a Cambridge Preliminary\nEnglish Test (PET) as well as the proficiency level reported\nby the learners, their level of English reading proficiency\nwas at the intermediate level. The results of the PET are\nshown in Table 1.\nInstruments\nTo achieve the aims of the study, three instruments were\nused: (a) a reading proficiency test, (b) L1 and L2 reading\nattitude questionnaires, and (c) a reading achievement\ntest. What follows is the description of these three\nmeasures.\nPET.A PET was administered to make sure that learners\nwere homogeneous with respect to their reading proficiency.\nPET is a qualification in EFL developed by Cambridge\nESOL. The test measures the overall language proficiency of\ntest takers up to B1 level of Common European Framework\nof Reference for Languages (CEFR) corresponding to the\ntraditional level of intermediate language proficiency. As the\nparticipants of the study had just started studying English at\nintermediate level, this test could well serve the purpose of\nthe study. It is worth noting that because the variables under\nstudy were related to foreign language reading and that read-\ning performance was one of the variables, only the reading\nsection was used in the study.\nTable 1. Statistics of Reading Scores on the 230 Language\nLearners.\nPET reading \nNote. PET = Preliminary English Test.\nAkbari et al. 3\nL1 and L2 reading attitude questionnaires. The present study is\naimed at investigating the connection between L1 and L2\nreading attitudes. The needed data were collected through L1\nand L2 reading attitude questionnaires, adapted from Lee\nand Schallert (2014) and targeted attitude components pro-\nposed by Mathewson (1994), that is, feeling (affective), eval-\nuative beliefs (cognitive), and action readiness (conative).\nBased on the factorial report by Lee and Schallert (2014), the\nscales consisted of five factors, namely, cognitive attitudes,\nconative attitudes, negative affect, anxiety, and self-assess-\nment. According to Lee and Schallert (2014), cognitive fac-\ntor is related to the intellectual, practical, and linguistic\nvalues of reading; conative factor to the actual behavior of\nreaders; and negative affect and anxiety to negative feeling\nabout reading and self-assessment to students'perceptions of\ntheir reading competence (see Tables 4 and 5 to find each\nitem of the questionnaires and the respected factors). Both of\nthese measures were in Persian to prevent any misleading\ninformation due to possible English linguistic deficiency by\nparticipants. For each item, the students rated the extent to\nwhich they agree with the statement on a 5-point scale with 1\n= not at all true of me and 5 = completely true of me. The\noriginal questionnaire contained 30 items which were\nreduced to 27 in L1 reading attitude questionnaire after revi-\nsion, but it remained the same in L2 reading attitude ques-\ntionnaire. To remove any concerns regarding the reliability\nof the two scales, they were both piloted on a sample of 30\nEFL learners. Table 2 displays the statistics obtained after\nadministering the two scales to the pilot sample.\nAs seen in Table 2, mean score of L1 reading attitude is\nless than L2 reading mean score, which may be construed as\nthe more positive attitudes of the participants toward L2\nreading rather than L1 reading. However, this should also be\nremembered that they were voluntary EFL learners. This\nmeans that they held positive attitudes toward L2 learning as\nthey were willing to learn English voluntarily. Cronbach's\nalpha indicated an index of .86 and .74 for internal consis-\ntency of L2 and L1 reading attitudes, respectively.\nReading achievement test. The reading achievement test used\nin the present study was the standard reading test used by\nlanguage institutes. The reading comprises three passages,\nwhich were similar to the reading passages covered during\nthe instruction period. Totally, the test contained 15 multiple-\nchoice questions assessing students'inferencing ability, main\nidea extraction, lexical inferencing, and sentence and general\ncomprehension. To have a better psychological effect on stu-\ndents and have a better comparability impression with PET\nscores, the obtained scores were multiplied by 3. Therefore,\nthe minimum score could be 0 and maximum score could be\n45. The result of this test was used to calculate the predict-\nability power of L1 and L2 reading attitudes in explaining\nthe L2 reading achievement.\nProcedure\nAfter consulting various private institutes and getting their\nconsent for using their students as participants of the study,\nselection of the participants started. Based on the agree-\nment between the researcher and the language institutes,\nthe researcher promised to keep the name of institutes and\nstudents confidential. The institutes were asked to provide\nthe researcher with a list of their intermediate students.\nThrough consulting the list of intermediate students, 304\nstudents were selected as the initial pool of participants of\nthe study. Students sat for the PET, and after scoring stu-\ndents' paper, students whose scores fell between +1 and -1\nstandard deviation were selected as the legitimate subjects\nof the study. This was to make sure they are roughly homog-\nenized in terms of L2 reading ability. In total, 230 students\nout of 304 students were chosen to participate in the study.\nNext, students completed the L2 and L1 reading attitude\nmeasures after receiving proper guidance and instructions\non how to complete the measures. To score the measures,\nstudents' responses to each item were assigned a value,\nranging from 1 to 5. The value 1 was an indication of total\nabsence of the truthfulness of the item, and a value of 5\nindicated the complete truthfulness of the item for individu-\nals. All the scores of the items were added up to reach the\ntotal score of each person regarding their reading attitudes.\nA high score was an indication of positive attitude and a\nlow score was an indication of less positive attitude toward\neither L2 or L1 reading attitudes. The collected data were\nfed into the SPSS 16 data editor sheet and analyzed through\ndescriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple regression\nfunction of the software.\nResults\nThe first question of the study was about any relationship\nbetween the L1 and L2 reading attitudes of Iranian students.\nTo start investigating such relationship, initially, L1 and L2\nreading attitude scores of the participants of the study were\ndealt with in details. The results of descriptive analysis indi-\ncated that, as in the pilot study, students had higher mean\nscore in L2 reading attitude than in L1 reading attitude.\nTable 2. Descriptive Statistics of the L2 and L1 Reading Attitude Scale.\nM Variance SD Cronbach's  Number of items\n4 SAGE Open\nAs is evident in Table 3, students had a mean score of\nwith students' scores being more dispersed in L2 reading\nattitude than in L1 reading attitude. Detailed statistics of the\nL2 and L1 reading attitude items are displayed in Tables 4\nand 5, respectively. The mean scores in Tables 4 and 5 have\nbeen ordered in a descending manner, which means that the\ncognitive factor (items in cognitive factor) received the high-\nest scores and the conative factor (items in conative factor)\nreceived the lowest scores in L2 reading attitude scale. In\nother words, students were more positive toward the\nTable 3. Descriptive Statistics of L1 and L2 Reading Attitudes.\nN Minimum Maximum M SD\nTable 4.

In\nother words, the intellectual, practical, and linguistic values\nof L1 reading were among both the most positively and least\npositively viewed components of L1 reading (see Table 5 for\nmore detailed statistics of L1 reading attitude items).

This contradiction can be attributed to EFL context\nof Iran which makes L2 reading behavior and access to the\nappropriate materials and texts less convenient compared\nwith the situation for L1 reading.\nThe differences mentioned above were the most observ-\nable ones based on mean scores of the items. However, it was\nintended to explore the possible relationship between L1 and\nL2 reading attitudes as well, which needed to be documented\nthrough appropriate statistical tests. Accordingly, a Pearson\ncorrelation formula was used to investigate the relationship\nbetween L2 and L1 reading attitudes. Table 6 shows the\nresults of the Pearson correlation coefficient between L1 and\nL2 reading attitudes.\nAccording to the Pearson correlation coefficient output,\nL1 and L2 reading attitudes were significantly related, r(230)\n= .71, p  .05. This relationship was found to be positive;\ntherefore, any increase in L1 reading attitude corresponds to\nan increase in L2 reading attitude.\nAnother aim of the study was to understand how well L1\nreading attitude predicts L2 reading attitude, which was\nexplored through regression analysis. Due to the fact that\nregression analysis enquires certain assumptions to be met,\nfirst, prerequisite assumptions of regression analysis were\ndealt with. According to Pallant (2010), multicollinearity, nor-\nmality, linearity, homoscedasticity, and independence of resid-\nuals are prerequisite assumptions for carrying out regression\nanalysis. The above assumptions were checked by consulting\nvariance inflation factor (VIFs) for multicollinearity, and\nnormal probability plot (P-P) of the regression standardized\nresidual and the scatterplot for normality, linearity, homosce-\ndasticity, and independence of residuals assumptions.\nAfter establishing the prerequisite assumptions for regres-\nsion analysis, the output of regression model was consulted.\nAs Table 7 shows, L1 reading attitude significantly predicted\nreading attitude also explained a significant proportion of\np < .001 (see Table 8). Accordingly, it can be concluded that\nL1 reading attitude can significantly predict L2 reading\nattitude.\nThe third research question asked how well L1 and L2\nreading attitudes predict L2 reading achievement. According\nto the obtained results from L2 reading achievement test,\nwith the maximum score of 6.00 and minimum score of 36\n(see Table 9).\nTo find the answer to the third research question, again\nregression analysis was sought after examining the prerequi-\nsite assumptions of multiple regression analysis by checking\nVIF normal probability plot (P-P) of the regression standard-\nized residual and the scatterplot. After establishing the prereq-\nuisite assumptions for regression analysis, the output of\nTable 6.

As Table 11 shows, L1 read-\ning attitude did not make a unique and significant contribution\nHowever, L2 reading attitude made a unique and significant\np > .04 (see Table 10). Totally, L1 and L2 reading attitudes\nexplained a significant proportion of variance in L2 reading\n11). Therefore, it was concluded that L1 and L2 reading atti-\ntudes significantly predict L2 reading performance.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of the study was to understand how L1 and L2\nreading attitudes are connected and how these two explained\nL2 reading achievement. Based on the results of the analysis,\nit was found that L1 and L2 reading attitudes are highly cor-\nrelated (r = .71) and L1 reading attitude significantly\nexplained 51% of the variance in L2 reading attitude. Both\nL1 and L2 reading attitudes accounted for 11% of the vari-\nance in L2 reading achievement, but, among the two, only L2\nreading attitude made unique significant contribution to L2\nreading achievement. This may point to the differences in the\nkind of attitudes (cognitive, conative, etc.) Iranian EFL\nlearners hold toward L1 and L2 reading. With respect to the\nstrong relationship between L1 and L2 reading attitudes,\nvarious explanations can be put forward. Such a strong rela-\ntionship can be attributed to values Iranian society put on\nreading and literacy. Mastashari and Khodamhosseini (2004)\nreported that Iranians in the United States are the most edu-\ncated and one quarter of Iranians aged above 25 and living in\nthe United States have at least a graduate degree.\nIt can also be hypothesized that L1 and L2 are related and\nthis relationship affects the reading attitudes as well. In this\nregard,previousresearchalsosupportstherelationshipbetween\nL1 reading and L2 reading and also between L1 reading atti-\ntude and L2 reading attitude. This interrelationship between L1\nand L2 has been considered both theoretically and empirically.\nFor instance, in the theory of Interdependence Hypothesis\nunderlying constructs that join L1 and L2 reading has been\nconsidered common underlying proficiency which posits that\nthe cognitive skills developed in L1 have the capacity to be\ntransferred into L2. It can be argued that such transference can\nhappen to reading attitude and beliefs. Alexander and Filler\n(1976) defines reading attitude as \"a system of feelings related\nto reading which causes the learner to approach or avoid a read-\ning situation\" (p. 1), and Smith (1990) defines it as \"a state of\nmind, accompanied by feelings and emotions, that make read-\ning more or less probable\" (p. 215). Accordingly, there is high\npossibility that if a person who has positive attitudes toward\nreading in L1, he or she has similar attitudes toward reading\nthough the desire of the person to read L2 texts may diminish\ndue to L2 language deficiency and the related challenges.\nIn addition, the Threshold Hypothesis (Alderson, 1984;\nCummins, 1979) stated that to develop a second language, a\ncertain level of L1 knowledge is needed. Both Threshold\nHypothesis and Interdependence Hypothesis provided the\nground for justifying the relationship between the L1 and L2,\nwhich consequently paves the way for a second justification,\nand that is the transference of attitude from L1 to L2.\nAs shown in the \"Results\" section of the present article, a\nstrong relationship was found between L1 and L2 reading\nattitudes. In other words, those who generally believe that L1\nreading is beneficial to them (cognitive attitude), have posi-\ntive feeling toward it (affective attitude), or are involved with\nactual reading behaviors may transfer the same attitudes to\nthe L2 reading. The strong relationship between L1 and L2\nreading has also been documented by various researchers\n(e.g., Lee & Schallert, 1997; Pichette, Segalowitz, & Connors,\nrelationships existed among the L2 readers with higher lan-\nguage proficiency, which supports the Threshold Hypothesis.\nIn a meta-analysis done by Jeon and Yamashita (2014), they\nfound 10 predictors of L2 reading among which L1 reading\nwas one of them. With respect to empirical studies directly\nrelated to L1 and L2 reading attitudes, two pioneer works\nTable 10.

F change Durbin\u00adWatson\n8 SAGE Open\nL2 reading attitudes also indicated that L1 reading attitudes\nare transferrable to L2 reading.\nApart from the relationship between L1 and L2 reading\nattitude, the first difference observed was related to the high-\nest mean scores of items between the L1 and L2 reading atti-\ntudes. With regard to L2 reading attitudes, students viewed\nmost positively the cognitive merits of L2 reading or the\nintellectual and linguistic benefits of L2 reading. However, it\nwas the combination of cognitive and conative perspectives\nthat viewed positively in L1 reading motivation. Such differ-\nences between L1 and L2 reading attitudes have also been\nreported by Yamashita (2007). Among the reported differ-\nences, Yamashita also pointed to the fact that students\nbelieved that more practical benefits could be obtained from\nL2 reading rather than L1 reading. Considering the nature of\ncognitive benefits of reading attitudes, one can infer that this\nelement of attitude corresponds to the instrumental kind of\nmotivation (Gardner, 1985) and extrinsic motivation (Noels,\nrelates instrumental motivation to the potential pragmatic\nbenefits of L2 proficiency like job promotion or achieving\nhigher grades, and Noels et al. (2000) talk about sources of\nmotivation external to learner (tangible benefits) as one of\nthe sources of motivation. As \"motivation is the one of the\nmain determinants of second/foreign language achievement\"\nattitude with highest mean score of cognitive attitude best\npredicted L2 reading achievement. This analysis suggests the\nclose association between motivation and attitude in L2\nreading similarly taken into account by Tremblay and\nGardner (1995) in their second language motivation model.\nIn the L1 reading attitude of Iranians, conative attitude\nreceived more attention. Now the question is whether higher\nscores of conative attitude could contribute to prediction of\nL2 reading due to high correlation coefficient between L1\nand L2 reading attitudes. The answer can be both yes and no\nregarding the fact that, first of all, the relationship between\nL1 and L2 reading attitudes has not always been straightfor-\nward and, second, mere conative attitude or the actual read-\ning behavior particularly of L1 could not be interpreted as\nthe positive internal desire toward reading. Simply mention-\ning that I go to library for reading L1 texts does not mean that\nthe person is interested in reading. Instead, it may come from\ncertain responsibilities expected of students like academic\nassignments. This points directly to one of the limitations of\nquantitative analysis too as it does not provide enough space\nfor more dynamic and interpretative investigation. Moreover,\nthe presence of positive attitude may not necessarily lead to\nmore L2 reading, and there are demotivating factors as well\ncausing adverse effects on L2 reading behaviors (Falout,\nElwood, & Hood, 2009). For instance, one may hold a posi-\ntive attitude for the practical and intellectual benefits of L2\nreading, but certain obstacles like undesirable reading envi-\nronment may prevent him or her from focused and continu-\nous reading.\nConclusion\nBased on the results of the present study, L1 and L2 reading\nattitudes are strongly related and L1 reading can contribute\nto L2 reading, which suggests invaluable implications for\neducation system. The implications could be more emphasis\non L1 reading and literacy as well as increased awareness for\nvaluing reading and the related components. Based on\nresearch findings, phonological awareness in L1 contributes\nto literacy development in L1 and L2 (Durgunoglu, Nagy, &\nHancin-Bhatt, 1993; Quiroga, Lemos-Britton, Mostafapour,\nAbbott, & Berninger, 2001). In this regard, it is suggested\nthat more research is needed to identify the areas most com-\nmon between L1 and L1 reading. Studies on the nature of\nreading seem very enlightening in that various components\nin L1 and L2 reading could be associated and explored. For\ninstance, topical knowledge may have positive role in link-\ning the L1 and L2 reading as topical knowledge has been\nreported an important component of reading comprehension\nMoreover, positive L2 attitude contributed to L2 reading\nin the current study which points to the importance of devel-\noping positive attitude among L2 learners generally and L2\nreaders in particular. The results of the study also suggest\nthat the use of more qualitative approaches to attitude\nresearch is necessary to obtain richer data with more explan-\natory power.\n"
