Circulating homocysteine, a risk factor for car-\ndiovascular disease (CVD), is often elevated in chronic kidney\ndisease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Little is\nknown about the risk of elevated homocysteine associated with\nless advanced renal insufficiency in the community.\nMethods. Serum homocysteine concentration measures\n(umol/L) from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\nfunction levels were determined by Modified Diet in Renal Dis-\nease (MDRD) estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFRest)\n(mL/min/1.73 m2) and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio\n(ACR) (mg/g). Cumulative odds ratios (OR) of exceeding any\ngiven homocysteine cut point were computed by gender, using\nordinal logistic regression. Each model included GFRest (<60,\nred blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12\n, and dietary vitamin B6\nintake as independent variables.\nResults. The adjusted ORs for elevated homocysteine risk\nwere 9 to 11 times greater in adults with the lowest GFRest\nGFRest levels. Association measures for marginal GFRest lev-\nminuria (ACR 30 mg/g) was a significant, independent renal\nrisk factor for elevated homocysteine in men and women (ad-\nmal albumin excretion, but high normal albuminuria (ACR =\nConclusion. In the general population, renal insufficiency is\nstrongly associated with an increased risk of elevated circulat-\ning homocysteine, independent of B vitamin status. These re-\nsults raise the possibility that elevated homocysteine may be\nan important risk factor to explain the heavy burden of CVD\nassociated with kidney disease.\nKey words: chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease, fo-\nlate, B vitamins, NHANES.\nC 2004 by the International Society of Nephrology\nIn the United States mortality rates from cardiovas-\ncular disease (CVD) have shown a steady and remark-\nable decline over the last two decades [1, 2]. This trend,\nhowever, has not extended to patients with renal fail-\nure. The high CVD mortality in end-stage renal disease\n(ESRD) patients has shown no tendency to remit, and\nremains tenfold to 100-fold greater than expected for\nindividuals of the same age in the general population\n[3]. There is growing evidence that the heavy burden of\nCVD for individuals with renal disease begins long be-\nfore ESRD is reached [4\u00ad6]. Although the high CVD\nrisk may be partially explained by high rates of conven-\ntional cardiovascular risk factors, especially hyperten-\nsion, diabetes, and dyslipidemias [7\u00ad9], other factors of\nparticularly high prevalence in the kidney disease pop-\nulation may contribute. Possibilities include alterations\nin calcium-phosphate metabolism, high uric acid levels,\nactivation of vascular inflammatory processes, and el-\nevated homocysteine levels. The development of pre-\nventive strategies to reduce CVD risk in kidney disease\npatients will depend on clarification of the contribution\nof these other factors.\nHomocysteine, an established risk factor for\natherothrombotic vascular disease [10\u00ad13], is known\nto be markedly elevated in ESRD patients and mod-\nerately elevated in patients with diagnosed chronic\nkidney disease [14\u00ad16]. Homocysteine first emerged as\na cardiovascular risk factor from observations in young\npeople with a deficiency in cystathionine beta-synthase;\nthis genetic disorder causes very high homocysteine\nlevels, typically greater than 100 umol/L, and premature\nocclusive vascular disease [17]. A rather sizable body of\ncross-sectional epidemiologic investigation has extended\nthese observations to establish a strong association\nbetween cardiovascular disease and more modest\nelevations of homocysteine [11].\nWhile the association of kidney disease and elevated\nhomocysteine is well established in clinical populations,\nthere are no data that illuminate the degree of the over-\nall population risk. To our knowledge only one general\n304 Francis et al: Serum homocysteine and markers of impaired kidney function\npopulation study has investigated the strength of the\nassociation between markers of diminished renal func-\ntion and elevated homocysteine, but that study focused\non elevated homocysteine as a risk factor for albumin-\nuria [18]. Several studies have examined the association\nbetween renal function and homocysteine in renal clinic\npatients [14, 19], but extrapolation from such samples\nto the overall population is uncertain. Therefore, the\npresent study was performed to assess the strength of\nthe association between risk of elevated homocysteine\nand the presence of diminished kidney function in the\ncommunity using data from the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988\u00ad\n1994). Since elevated homocysteine may also be caused\nby inadequate intake or blood concentrations of nutri-\ntional co-factors for homocysteine metabolism [20], the\nhomocysteine-diminished renal function association was\nestimated while taking into account measures of folate,\n, and vitamin B6\n. This study is the first to doc-\nument the very substantial impact of renal disease on the\nUnited States population risk for elevated homocysteine.\nMETHODS\nPopulation and sample\nThe NHANES III was a multistage probability sam-\nple survey of noninstitutionalized civilian residents of the\nUnited States aged 2 months and older conducted dur-\nwith oversampling of some groups (e.g., minorities and\nthe elderly) was used to ensure more precise estimates\nof disease conditions. Participants were interviewed at\nhome and later during a physical examination at a Mo-\nbile Examination Center (MEC) where blood and urine\nsamples were collected for subsequent analyzes. During\nfrom adults 20 years of age and over, included measure-\nment of total homocysteine. This analysis is based on 3587\nparticipants who were at least 40 years of age at the time\nof the interview.\nData collection\nThe interviews of NHANES III participants included\nquestions that were used to classify persons according to\ngender, age, race/ethnicity, risk behavior attributes, med-\nical history, length of fast prior to the MEC examination,\nand total nutrient intake from food during the day pre-\nceding the MEC examination. Information on all foods\nand beverages consumed for the previous 24-hour time\nperiod was collected using an automated data collection,\ncoding, and interview system. Translation of foods con-\nsumed into dietary nutrient intake values [21] was based\non United States Dietary Association (USDA) food com-\nposition databases [22]. Total dietary vitamin B6\nintake\n(in mg), excluding nutritional supplement sources, was\navailable from the 24-hour dietary recall.\nDuring the MEC examination blood samples were\ncollected in ethyl acid containing tubes and centrifuged\nwithin 1 hour of collection. Serum was separated, frozen\nat -20C for overnight shipment on dry ice to a cen-\ntral laboratory and stored at -70C until assayed. An\nuntimed random sample of urine was collected using\nsterile clean-catch methods and urine specimens were\ntransported overnight on dry ice to a central laboratory\nMeasurements\nRed blood cell folate (in nmol/L) and serum vitamin\n(in pmol/L) were measured by using a radioassay\nkit (Quantaphase Folate) from Bio-Rad Laboratories\n(Hercules, CA, USA). Total homocysteine concentration\nin residual serum samples (previously analyzed for folate\nand refrozen) was quantified (in umol/L)\nusing reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatog-\nraphy (HPLC) and fluorescence detection [23]. Serum\ncreatinine was measured by the modified kinetic Jaff\u00b4\ne\nreaction [24] using a Hitachi 737 analyzer. Thawed urine\nspecimens were analyzed by fluorescent immunoassay for\nalbumin [25] and the modified kinetic method of Jaff\u00b4\ne for\ncreatinine using the Beckman Synchron AS/Astra ana-\nlyzer [24]. Urine analysis was not performed on visibly\nhematuric specimens or on specimens testing positive\nfor hemoglobin or nitrites using qualitative test strips\n(Multistix). Interassay coefficients of variation were 9%\nfor serum homocysteine; 7% for serum vitamin B12\nfor red blood cell folate; less than 1.5% for serum cre-\natinine; less than 16% and 10%, respectively, for low\n(1.0 mg/L) and medium (7 mg/L) urine albumin control\nstandards; and less than 8%, 2%, and 3%, respectively,\nfor low (1.0 mg/dL), medium (6 mg/dL), and high (70\u00ad\n99 mg/dL) urinary creatinine control standards.\nFor this study the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ra-\ntio (ACR) is reported in milligrams per gram. Estimates\nof the glomerular filtration rate (GFRest), expressed in\nmL/min/1.73 m2, were calculated as a function of age,\nserum creatinine, gender, and race/ethnicity using the\nsimplified Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)\nAfrican American). The value of 0.23 was subtracted\nfrom the reported serum creatinine concentration prior\nto use in the formula. This conversion aligns calibration\nof the NHANES laboratory with the laboratory used for\nthe MDRD samples [27]. In two participants GFRest\nslightly exceeded 200 and these estimates were truncated\nat that level. Creatinine clearance was estimated from\nthe Cockcroft-Gault formula [28] corrected for body sur-\nface area to 1.73 m2 using the height and weight of the\nindividual.\nFrancis et al: Serum homocysteine and markers of impaired kidney function 305\nStatistical analyses\n2167 women) had data on serum homocysteine, serum\ncreatinine, urinary albumin and urinary creatinine mea-\nsures. After sequential exclusion of adults who had eaten\nwithin 6 hours of the MEC examination (n = 218 men\nand n = 268 women) and women who were pregnant\nand/or concurrently menstruating (n = 70), the data from\nMean fasting times (\u00b1standard error) were 11.3 hours\nestimates of measures of association between physiologic\nvariables can be obtained from these data by incorporat-\ning sample weights reflecting different probabilities of\nselection and differential nonresponse patterns for var-\nious subgroups in the United States civilian noninstitu-\ntionalized population. All analyzes were performed using\nSUDAAN [29] and incorporated sampling weights and\nadjustments for complex survey design, unless otherwise\nstated.\nThe study outcome was serum homocysteine level,\n30\u00ad33]. The main analysis variables were urinary ACR,\nEstimates of the elevated homocysteine-diminished renal\nfunction association were computed from cumulative (or\nproportional odds) logistic regression models [34], and\nproduced association measures that represent the cumu-\nlative odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI. In these models,\nthe categorical homocysteine value was the dependent\nvariable and the independent variables were the categor-\nical markers of diminished renal function (i.e., ACR and\nGFRest), B vitamin status and demographic attributes.\nwere chosen to reflect the minimum levels considered to\nbe clinically adequate [35]. Similar recommendations [36]\nwere the basis for categorizing dietary vitamin B6\nintake\nof age). Serum vitamin B12\nlevels were based on gender-\nspecific median concentration [37]. Race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nother) and age in years were included as demographic\ncovariates. Conceptually, cumulative logistic regression\nmodeling is analogous to fitting in this case three parallel\nlogistic regression models with a common odds ratio for\nthe GFRest, ACR, race/ethnicity, age, and B vitamin sta-\ntus parameters at each homocysteine threshold while still\nincorporating the ordinal nature of homocysteine thresh-\nolds. The resulting data can be interpreted in terms of the\nodds of a randomly selected person exceeding versus not\nexceeding a particular homocysteine cut point in compar-\nison with a randomly selected reference person.\nPrevalence of elevated homocysteine in each gender\ngroup, as well as, means, medians, and percentiles for\ncontinuous variables were estimated using appropriate\nsample weights. Similar statistics for continuous vari-\nables in men and women stratified by homocysteine cate-\ngorywerealsocalculated. Genderdifferencesweretested\nusing the z test. Tests for trends were performed for\nthe continuous variables and were based on the signif-\nicance of the linear regression coefficient relating the\nvariable in its continuous form to the categorical level\nof serum homocysteine. Multivariate models were fitted\nusing PROC MULTILOG. Separate cumulative logistic\nregression models were estimated for each sex. If not oth-\nerwise noted, statistical significance refers to P < 0.05.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics\nCharacteristics of men and women residents of the\nUnited States who were 40 years of age and older are\nshown in Table 1.

The findings con-\nfirm several associations noted previously in population\nstudies: homocysteine levels were higher in men than\nin individuals with lower red blood cell folate, or lower\nor a dietary intake of vitamin B6\nbelow\nAs in most other epidemiologic investigations, we re-\nlied on estimation of GFRs. We used the simplified\nMDRD prediction equation that has been validated in\nUnited States adults with established chronic renal dis-\nease [26]. Observations on the ACR in untimed urine\nspecimens were used since measures of albumin in a 24-\nhour urine collection were not available [43]. An ACR\n30 mg/g in random urine specimens has consistently\nbeen shown to have good reliability for detecting 24-hour\nexcluded from the analysis persons who had not fasted for\nat least 6 hours to reduce elevations in physiologic mea-\nsures that can be caused by recent intake of a protein\nrich meal [46\u00ad48]; however, as a consequence, persons\nwith insulin-dependent diabetes who were not required\ntofastundertheNHANESIIIprotocolwerenotincluded\nin the analysis.\nThe most important finding in this study is the steep\ngradient in risk of elevated homocysteine associated with\nGFR in this general population.

There are several possible\nbiologic mechanisms whereby an elevated homocysteine\nlevel might exert a deleterious effect on vascular func-\ntion. Homocysteine may have prooxidant effects [50, 51],\nit can diminish nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation [52],\nand it may promote thrombosis or impede fibrinolysis\n[50, 53]. Less frequently discussed is the possibility that\nelevated homocysteine may also diminish adenosine for-\nmation [54], adenosine being an important cardiac va-\nsodilator as well as a vasoconstrictor in the renal vascular\n%\ntHcy, \u00b5mol/L\nMales Females\nFig. 4.

Homocysteine lowering appears to\nbe of value in reducing vascular events in patients with\ncystathionine beta-synthase deficiency [17], but these ob-\nservations may not be able to be extrapolated to the gen-\neral population since homocysteine levels are very much\nhigher in patients with this disease than encountered in\nthe general population.

One of these,\nthe FAVORIT trial, addresses the impact of homocys-\nteine lowering in a renal disease population. This study\n[60], which recently began recruitment, will examine the\nimpact on cardiovascular event rate of folate, vitamin\nand vitamin B6\nsupplementation in renal transplant\nrecipients. This study is being undertaken in the trans-\nplant population because preliminary observations es-\ntablished that vitamin supplementation in this population\nwas effective at reducing homocysteine levels [61, 62]. A\nnumber of observations suggest that in the dialysis popu-\nlation homocysteine is relatively resistant to vitamin sup-\nplementation [63, 64]. Interestingly, however, nocturnal\ndialysis has recently been shown to produce large reduc-\ntions in homocysteine levels [65].\nOur study may also help clarify a controversy in the lit-\nerature about the impact of increased albumin excretion\nrate on the risk of elevated homocysteine. Findings from\nprevious studies of the association between albuminuria\nand homocysteine have been equivocal; some investiga-\ntors have concluded that the association was due to an\nassociation of albuminuria with GFR [19, 66] while oth-\ners have concluded that the association was independent\nof GFR [67, 68]. Our study differs from previous anal-\nyses in that we were able to assess the strength of the\nassociation in a larger sample of individuals with modest\nelevations in albumin excretion rate. Approximately 500\nsubjects from our total sample of over 3000 individuals\nhad an ACR of 30 mg/g or greater. For this subpopulation,\nthe cumulative OR of an abnormal homocysteine level\nwas increased 1.8-fold, after adjustment for demographic\nvariables, estimated GFR and B vitamin status level. This\nincrease in risk was highly significant. Nonetheless, it\nwas quantitatively much less than the approximately ten-\nfold increase in risk we found for subjects with a GFR\nrisk may explain why in smaller samples GFR would\nemerge as the dominant determinant of homocysteine\nlevels.\n310 Francis et al: Serum homocysteine and markers of impaired kidney function\nTable 2.

Our results are, therefore, not inconsistent\nwith the observations from the IDNT study, a large clin-\nical trial in subjects with established diabetic nephropa-\nthy, that overt proteinuria is not independently associated\nwith elevated homocysteine, and the conclusion that in\nthis condition, a low GFR is the main determinant of ho-\nmocysteine levels [19].\nThe direction of any causal connections between high\nhomocysteine and low GFR or elevated ACR has been\nactively debated [32, 69], and these issues cannot be re-\nsolved by cross-sectional studies like this one. It appears\nlikely from a number of observations that reduced re-\nnal function, reflected in a low GFR, is causal for ele-\nvations of homocysteine, although the mechanism prob-\nably does not reflect a simple relationship with urinary\nclearance [70, 71]. Whether causal relationships underlie\nthe association with albuminuria is less clear and is an\nissue that will be most effectively clarified by prospec-\ntive evaluation of subjects with and without elevated\nhomocysteine.\nSeveral study design and methodologic issues must be\naddressed when considering the general applicability of\nour results. The study group was limited to individuals\naged 40 years and older because the main risk factor of in-\nterest, impaired renal function, is known to be associated\nwith aging and more uncommon in younger adults. Also,\nthe exclusion of younger adults created an age distribu-\ntion for this study that closely corresponded to the age\nrange of persons examined in previous studies of homo-\ncysteineconcentrationanditscorrelatesorpredictors[19,\nstatus, the vitamin B6\nmeasure in our study represented\ndietary intake determined from a 24-hour recall of food\nconsumption and does not necessarily reflect concentra-\ntions in cells or fluid. Means of physiologic measures\npresented here may not correspond to other published\nstatistics for this age group of NHANES III participants\ndue to use of different inclusion criteria, as well as estima-\ntion methods. In particular, many epidemiologic studies\nthat examine homocysteine concentration measures re-\nport the geometric mean, which is always smaller than an\narithmetic mean of the same data set.\nWe relied on the MDRD prediction equation to as-\nsess GFR. There are no reliability data on the perfor-\nmance of this method in a general population. However,\nthe MDRD equation was devised as a prediction equa-\ntion for GFR and validated as an estimation method for\nthe population with reduced renal function. Most of our\nresults were confirmed in a secondary analysis that substi-\ntuted values from the Cockcroft-Gault equation in place\nof MDRD predicted GFR. We still found significantly\nFrancis et al: Serum homocysteine and markers of impaired kidney function 311\nincreased risk of elevated homocysteine associated with\nalbuminuria and with low Cockcroft-Gault renal func-\ntion, although the risk in women with low Cockcroft-\nGault renal function was diminished. But findings for\nmoderately reduced renal function levels conflicted;\nwhereas elevated homocysteine risk achieved signifi-\ncance in the MDRD-based analysis it did not in the\nCockcroft-Gault\u00adbased analysis. This difference proba-\nbly reflects differences between the compositions of the\ngroupsidentifiedbythetwomethods;ithasbeenreported\nthat the Cockcroft-Gault equation tends to overestimate\nlow values and to underestimate normal to high values of\ndirectly measured GFR [72].\nOurchoiceofacumulativelogisticregressionmodelre-\nflected our primary emphasis on estimating the strength\nof the homocysteine-renal function impairment associ-\nation and we included in our model only those factors\nproven or presumed to be confounding factors for ho-\nmocysteine metabolism. This criterion meant that we did\nnot include in the analysis a number of other variables,\nsuch as alcohol intake, smoking, and serum albumin, po-\ntentially associated with homocysteine, and potentially\nof interest in other circumstances. The observed risk esti-\nmates represent a summary measure of the adjusted ORs\nfor each definition of elevated homocysteine considered\nin the analysis (i.e., 9 umol/L versus <9, 12 umol/L\nlative logistic regression models can be used as a basis\nfor describing the reality of complex relations between\nvariables of interest or for investigating mechanisms that\nmight explain the relation, such analyses were superflu-\nous to the goals of the present study. These constraints\nshould be considered when interpreting our findings.\nCONCLUSION\nWe find a strong association between markers of early\ndiminished renal function and risk of elevated homocys-\nteine, independent of B vitamin status and age. Elevated\nhomocysteine is therefore, an important candidate risk\nfactor to account for the increased CVD risk in patients\nwith chronic renal insufficiency, and an appealing one\nsince it is potentially a risk factor that could be reduced\ncost effectively. Should the current randomized trials of\nhomocysteine reduction establish the benefit of this in-\ntervention, the implications for reducing CVD risk are\nsubstantial.\nReprint requests to Josephine P.
