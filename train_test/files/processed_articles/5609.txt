This growing literature in observational\nstudies has provided many insights in regards to the impact\nof disgust and authoritarianism (Casey, 2016; Miller et al.,\n(Miller et al., 2017), on attitudes, as well as support for\ntransgender candidates for public office (Haider-Markel\net al., 2017). We have also learned how attitudes about\ntransgender people and transgender rights differ from atti-\ntudes about gay people and gay rights (Lewis et al, 2017).\nExperimental studies have found that canvassers can dura-\nbly reduce transphobia (Broockman and Kalla, 2016),\nexposure to information and images of transgender people\ncan also reduce transphobia (Flores et al, 2017), and that\nvalue frames and identity have the potential to affect sup-\nport for transgender people's access to public restrooms\nWe contribute to this growing literature by testing a pro-\nposed causal mechanism between exposure to transgender\npeople and increased support for transgender rights: preju-\ndice reduction. Prejudice reduction, as used here, is when\nnegative attitudes and phobias towards marginalized groups\nment to assess how prejudice reduction serves as a vehicle\nfor individual support for transgender rights.\nQuite possibly, the most seminal work in attitude\nTransgender prejudice reduction\nand opinions on transgender rights:\nResults from a mediation analysis on\nexperimental data\nAndrew R.

Subsequent studies, espe-\ncially studies about the rights of sexual minorities and\nmore recently gender minorities, investigate the way per-\nsonally knowing someone who is lesbian, gay, bisexual,\nand/or transgender (LGBT) is associated with attitudes on\nLGBT rights. The presumed, though often untested, mech-\nanism linking contact to greater policy support is prejudice\nreduction. However, is this assumption correct? Does prej-\nudice reduction serve as a vehicle to greater support for\nrights for marginalized groups? Our experiment tests this\ncausal mechanism by exposing individuals to short infor-\nmational vignettes and facial images of people presumed\nto be transgender. Our post-test then measures transphobia\nand support for transgender rights policies. We find that\nprejudice reduction is a mechanism for support for\ntransgender rights. We further show that our results are\nrobust to key assumptions related to the causal mecha-\nnisms of attitude change.\nMere exposure and prejudice reduction: A\nmechanism to increased policy support?\nAlthough our treatments are not the same as the contact\nhypothesis, studies have shown that simple exposure to\nZebrowitz, White, and Wieneke, 2008). Previous studies,\nfor example, have shown that exposure to the lives of lesbi-\nans and gay men via television increases both positive atti-\ntudes toward gay men (Schiappa, Gregg, and Hewes, 2006)\nand support for lesbian and gay rights (Garretson, 2015).\nThe mere exposure hypothesis contends that simply expos-\ning people to new concepts has the tendency to increase\nlikeability toward those objects. Indeed, an experimental\nstudy shows that mere exposure to facial images and infor-\nmation about transgender people can reduce discomfort\nwith transgender people and transphobia (Flores et al,\nand Kalla (2016) failed to find any direct effect of treat-\nments affecting individual attitudes on transgender rights.\nIn follow-up surveys and a subsequent survey experiment,\nBroockman and Kalla (2016) later defined the term\ntransgender to both treated and untreated households and\nrandomized exposure to negative transgender campaign\nadvertisements to connect their canvassing experiment to\nindividual support for transgender rights. We add to these\nstudies by more fully examining this mechanism.\nA puzzle in both previous experiments is that respond-\nents' prejudices toward transgender people were reduced,\nyet there is little evidence of a direct effect on attitudes on\ntransgender rights. Possibly, there are multiple mechanisms\nunderlying the direct effect of mere exposure or canvassing\non transgender rights. Some of these effects may be com-\npeting. For example, people with higher disgust levels tend\nto be opposed to gay rights (Adams, Stewart, and Blanchar,\n2014), and LGBT rights may also increase people's disgust\n(Casey, 2016). If the experimental treatments simultane-\nously increased disgust levels and reduced transphobia,\nthen the direct effect may be washed out by these compet-\ning mechanisms. Thus, our study decomposes this direct\neffect using a mediation model. The mediation model sepa-\nrates the specified causal mechanism--in the current case,\ntransphobia--from the remaining, unobserved mechanisms\nlinking treatment to support for transgender rights.\nData and analysis\nWe fielded a survey experiment that was jointly sponsored by\nsome of the institutions affiliated with the authors. Clear\nVoice Research (CVR) conducted the survey experiment\nwho serve as a subject pool for research purposes. This pool\nwas pre-screened with a member profile survey, and CVR uti-\nlized numerous validation methods, such as Internet Protocol\n(IP) and street address verification to minimize duplicate\nrespondents and ensure the overall quality of the data. The\nsampling methodology is an enhancement over student and\nonline convenience samples such as Amazon Mechanical\nTurk.1 We note that this sample, while an improvement, was\nnot selected using traditional probability-based methods.\nCVR sent 51,492 recruitment emails to empaneled survey\nparticipants. A total of 2102 subjects participated in the sur-\nvey, which provided a response rate of 10.82% (AAPOR\nRR#2). All subjects consented to participate in the study.\nResearch design\nTreatment:Informationalvignettesandfacialimages.Respond-\nents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions\n(three treatment groups and one control group). The three\ntreatment groups each received an information vignette that\ndefined gender identity and transgender as follows.\nGender identity refers to how a person identifies their own\ngender (as a man, woman, or some other label). For many\npeople their gender identity may not match their birth sex. For\nexample, a man may identify more as female, or a woman may\nidentify more as male. Transgender is a general term for people\nwhose gender identity or expression is different from their\nbirth sex. Some transgender people may undergo gender\ntransition with medical procedures like hormone therapy or\nsurgery (often commonly called a `sex change'), but others do\nnot seek such medical assistance. Transgender includes groups\nyou might have heard before, including transsexual, cross-\ndressers, or gender queer people.\nThe control group received a vignette about Japanese eco-\nnomic growth. Subjects in two of the three treatment groups\nalso received images of gender-congruent or gender-incon-\ngruent male and female faces (see Figure 1).2 Respondents\nin the Congruent condition received both facial images of\nFigure 1(a), and respondents in the Incongruent condition\nFlores et al. 3\nreceived both facial images of Figure 1(b). The other treat-\nment group (No Image) received no images but got the gen-\nder identity-defining vignette. Flores et al. (2017) previously\nshowed these exposures have the effect of reducing\ntransphobia and discomfort toward transgender people, but\ndid not find any significant direct treatment effects on sup-\nport for transgender rights. In this study, we expected the\ntreatments to cause positive shifts in attitudes consistent\nwith the mere exposure hypothesis. Our goal in this analysis\nwas to show how exposure might cause support for transgen-\nder rights by way of reducing transphobia. We expected that\ntransphobia would mediate the relationship between expo-\nsure and attitudes about transgender rights.\nMediator variable: Genderism and transphobia. In the survey\npost-test, we measured transphobia with questions from\nthe Genderism and Transphobia Scale (GTS) designed to\ngauge people's general tolerance for gender non-conform-\nity (Hill and Willoughby, 2005). The entire GTS contained\n32 questions to measure two or three correlated constructs:\ngenderism, transphobia, and gender-bashing.3 We used a\nsubset of five items from the GTS to measure transpho-\nbia--an emotional dislike against people who violate gen-\nder norms. Each of the questions utilized a seven-point\nstrongly agree to strongly disagree scale. The five items\nscaled onto a single construct  =\n( )\n. . We rescaled the\nitems such that positive values indicate higher levels of tol-\nerance for gender non-conformity. Full question wordings\nare provided in Supporting Information (SI) 2. The media-\ntor variable was measured utilizing structural equation\nmodels (i.e., factor analysis) with its mean set to zero and\nvariance set to one for identification purposes.\nDependent variables: Equality and\naccommodations policies\nWe also included a set of questions about transgender rights\nafter the measurement of transphobia; these questions were\nfirst asked in a 2011 Public Religion Research Institute sur-\nvey on transgender rights (see Flores 2015, Table 1). We\nalso adapted questions relating to gay rights from sources\nlike the Gender Social Survey or American National\nElection Studies, and we developed questions that were\nunique to transgender rights (e.g., public accommodations\nand access to public restrooms). These indicators were\nmeasured on a four-point scale, ranging from completely\nagree to completely disagree that had no neutral category.\nWe created scales of these policy questions by first assess-\ning whether transgender rights should be treated as unidi-\nmensional or multidimensional (see also Miller et al.,\n2017). These policies were more easily grouped into two\ndimensions: policies relating to equality and policies\nuniquely relating to accommodations (see Flores et al,\n2017; Appendix D). Our analysis of transgender rights used\nthese subsets, and positive values related to greater support\nfor transgender rights.\nEquality policies were defined as policies that ensure the\nequal treatment of transgender people. This included\nwhether transgender people should be protected from job\ndiscrimination, allowed to serve openly in the military, and\nincluded in equal rights generally as would be the case for\nlesbians, gay men, and other citizens. Accommodations\npolicies were defined as policies that would offer additional\nprotections for transgender people.4 These policies involved\nboth public and private accommodations, including the use\nof public restrooms, medical treatment for transgender\nhealth issues, and businesses' right to use religious reasons\nto refuse services to transgender people.\nMethods of analysis\nPropensity score weighting.We initially conducted a full\nassessment of balance checks based on responses to the\npre-test questionnaire and demographics. Our experiment\nFigure 1. Facial exposure treatments. (a) the congruent\ntreatment; (b) the incongruent treatment.\nNote: This figure should note that it is used with permission.

The balance checks indicated some significant dif-\nferences across our treatment groups in responses to the\npre-test, so we created covariate balance propensity scores\n(CBPS) to reduce these differences (Fong, Ratkovic, and\nCovariate adjustment. We also used covariate adjustment to\nincrease the efficiency of estimated effects (Gerber and\nels of moral traditionalism by combining four questions\ninto a single scale  =\n( )\n. ; the question wordings came\nfrom the American National Election Studies. We included\npartisanship by using a traditional seven-point indicator\nranging from strongly Democratic to strongly Republican.\nWe additionally controlled for age, race, sex, and whether\nsomeone identifies as LGBT.5\nStructural equation modeling.Structural equation modeling\n(SEM) allowed us to simultaneously estimate a measurement\nmodel for our dependent variables, examine the structural\nparameters of the treatment effects, and decompose effects\nfor causal mechanisms. SEM used the responses to sets of\nindicators to form constructs that correct for potential\nmeasurement error in any single item. The resultant con-\ntinuous constructs were then used as dependent variables in\nregression models. Since the items forming the constructs\nwere ordinal, we use a weighted least square with mean\nadjusted variance (WLSMV) estimator, which is the best\nmultivariate estimator with ordinal data (Brown, 2006). We\nstandardized all of the constructs to have a mean of zero\nand variance of one. The linear structural equation model\nmight carry with it untenable assumptions in identifying\ncausal mechanisms (Imai et al., 2011). As such, we also\npresented results from sensitivity analyses on the key causal\nassumption of exogeneity of the mediator and outcome\nvariables given that both are in the post-test also referred to\nas sequential ignorability.\nThe model schematic is plotted in Figure 2, which shows\nthe role of the mediator on transgender rights. Our goal was\nto examine the role of causally reducing transphobia as an\nunderlying mechanism of increasing support for transgen-\nder rights. Given previous research findings, we expected\nthe treatments to reduce transphobia, and we anticipated\nexposure effects to induce greater support on both transgen-\nder rights scales. We conducted two mediation models: the\nfirst with the dependent variable being equality policies and\nthe second with the dependent variable being accommoda-\ntions policies. We estimated the mediation models relying\non the Imai et al. (2011) framework as implemented by\nMuth\u00e9n (2011). Thus, the indirect effects were also the\nAverage Causal Mediation Effects.\nTable 1.

Consistent with expectations, transpho-\nbia had an effect on people's attitudes on transgender rights.\nA one standard deviation reduction in transphobia corre-\nsponded with a 0.58 standard deviation increase in support\nand a 0.68 standard deviation increase in support of accom-\nwith expectations, the treatments had reductions in\ntransphobia relative to the control. The No Image treatment\nreduced transphobia by 0.19 standard deviations (s.e. =\nthe Incongruent treatment reduced transphobia by 0.18\nThese results are consistent with our earlier finding that\nthe effects of the treatment have little direct relationship to\nviews about transgender rights (Flores et al., 2017). Yet the\nmediation analysis presented in Table 1 suggests this null\nrelationship may be driven by the mediated relationship\nbetween the treatments and transgender rights. The treat-\nments in the present analysis showed statistically insignifi-\ncant overall effects on transgender rights, but statistically\nsignificant effects on reducing transphobia. The results\nshowed that there is a negative, but often statistically insig-\nnificant direct effect of exposure to transgender informa-\ntion and images on support for transgender rights.\nImportantly, we found statistically significant indirect\neffects on transgender rights by reducing transphobia.\nExposure tended to increase support on both transgender\nrights constructs about one-tenth of a standard deviation,\nwhich is a relatively small effect size. This pattern was con-\nsistent in both equality policies and accommodations poli-\ncies, and the exposure effect sizes are similar across\ntreatment groups. The effects of the congruent image were\nslightly smaller than that of the other treatments, but they\ndid not differ in any statistically significant way. As docu-\nmented in SI 5, we found that these effects were similar for\nDemocrats, larger for independents, and were null for\nRepublicans.\nWhen assessing the effect size relative to the total effect\nof treatment on our dependent variables, Alwin and Hauser\n(1975) recommended reporting the percent mediated out of\nthe sum of the absolute value of these effects in models\nwhere the direct and indirect effects are of opposite signs.\nof the total absolute effect of treatment on transgender\nrights. This suggests that a substantial portion of the effect\nof the treatment is mediated by transphobia.\nSince transphobia was measured in the post-test along\nwith transgender rights, there may be unmeasured confound-\ners in both levels of transphobia and support for transgender\nrights. We only observed an individual's responses on\ntransgender rights and transphobia after receiving treatment,\nso the potential outcomes of individual support for transgen-\nder rights in a treatment group given that person's level of\ntransphobia had they been in the control group remained\ncounterfactual. A key identification assumption for causal\nmechanisms was that there is no residual correlation between\nthe mediator and outcome variables or sequential ignorabil-\nity (Imai et al., 2011). This assumption, however, can be\nevaluated by varying how much of a residual correlation\nwould have to be present to alter or reverse the results. A\nrobust relationship will not be sensitive to causal identifica-\ntion assumptions. We find that our findings are relatively\ninsensitive to the underlying assumptions to estimating\ncausal mechanisms (see SI 4).\nDiscussion\nPublic attitudes on transgender rights have become a rela-\ntively recent area of inquiry and these attitudes are conse-\nquential to whether states have transgender-inclusive policies\n(e.g., Flores, Herman, and Mallory, 2015). Yet, experimental\nstudies fail to show their treatments have any direct effect on\ntransgender rights. Following Broockman and Kalla (2016),\nwe suggest that this is because experimental treatments affect\nattitudes on transgender rights indirectly.\nOur findings offer some guidance for those seeking to\ninfluence public attitudes on transgender rights. First,\nreducing transphobia is a key mechanism for garnering\nsupport for transgender rights. Second, a way to reduce\ntransphobia is to humanize transgender people by exposing\nindividuals to information about them and representations\nof them. Finally and consistent with our earlier findings\n(Flores et al., 2017), attitudes about transgender people are\nlikely not dependent on perceived gender conformity.\nExposure to both our perceived congruent and incongruent\nimages had similar effects on reducing transphobia. We do\nnote that this does not mean that in highly sensitive circum-\nstances, such as when transgender people are in public\nrestrooms, that the potential for harassment, discrimination\nor assault is not dependent on perceived conformity (Miller\nand Grollman, 2015). Such contexts may be unique circum-\nstances. In addition, because we show both images of gender-\nconforming males and females to our respondents rather\nthan putting them into separate treatments by sex, treatment\neffects might actually differ for gender-conforming/non-\nconforming transmen and transwomen. Anecdotally, that is\nvery plausible.\nFully unpacking the causal mechanism from exposure to\npolicy support has eluded previous research. We provide\nsome evidence that prejudice reduction is indeed a vehicle\nfor enhancing support for marginalized groups. Further\nresearch should undertake more robust experimental designs\nthat would clearly account for sequential ignorability and\n6 Research and Politics \npost-treatment bias. Our sensitivity analyses suggest our\nresults are robust to the former assumption but do little to\naddress the latter. Alternative research designs as suggested\nby Imai et al. (2011) would facilitate in clearly specifying\nthe ways in which prejudice reduction enhances public sup-\nport for the rights of minority groups.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was supported by the University of Toledo, University of\nKansas, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, and\nOhio University.\nSupplementary materials\nThe supplementary files are available at http://journals.sagepub.\nare available at: http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/researchand\npolitics\nNotes\n1.
