    "abstract": "Background. Studies of liver donors' psychosocial outcomes focus on the short term and rely largely on quality-of-life mea- sures not specific to donation. We sought to examine long-term donation effects on 3 psychosocial domains: perceived physical, emotional, and socioeconomic outcomes. Methods. Individuals donating 3 to 10 years previously at 9 centers were eligible for telephone surveys. Survey responses were examined descriptively. Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct donor groups based on response profiles across psychosocial domains. Potential predictors of response profiles were evaluated with regression analysis. Results. Five hundred seventeen donors (66%) participated (M = 5.8 years postdonation, SD = 1.9). Fifteen percent to 48% of donors endorsed current donation-related physical health problems and concerns, and 7%-60% reported socioeconomic concerns (eg, insurance difficulties, financial expenditures). However, on average, donors experienced high psychological growth, and 90% felt positively about donation. Cluster analysis revealed 5 donor groups. One group showed high psychological benefit, with little endorsement of physical or socioeconomic concerns (15% of donors). Four groups showed less favorable profiles, with varying combinations of difficulties. The largest such group showed high endorsement of physical concerns and financial expen- ditures, and only modest psychological benefit (31% of donors). Men and nonHispanic whites were most likely to have unfavorable response profiles (Ps < 0.01). Compared with donors aged 19 to 30 years, older donors were less likely to have unfavorable pro- files; these differences were significant for donors in the >40 to 50 year age group (Ps < 0.008). Conclusions. Even many years postdonation, donors report adverse physical and socioeconomic effects, but positive emotional effects as well. Identification of response profiles and predictors may improve targeting of postdonation surveillance and care. 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 2 Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 3 Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 4 Department of Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 5 Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 6 Northwestern University Transplant Outcomes Research Collaborative (NUTORC),",

For example, up to 33% of donors report\npoorer health postdonation,15-17 up to 50% worry about last-\ning health effects,24,25 and over 25% have financial hardships,\nwith prominent concerns about current and future insurance\nstatus.16,19,26 Whether these problems persist, worsen, or re-\nsolve after the first few years postdonation is largely unknown.\nIn addition, the elevated rates of these problems are reported\nin the same literature--and sometimes within the same\nstudy--that also reports that liver donors' generic HRQOL\nThis suggests that generic measures may be insensitive for living\ndonors and should be used primarily as adjuncts to more sensi-\nEvidence beyond the first few years postdonation is scarce.\nWithin A2ALL, data from donors enrolled during the early\naverage, generic HRQOL assessed with the SF-36 exceeds\nnormative levels, even many years postdonation.31 Although\nA2ALL-1 included donors who were up to 11 years post-\ndonation, sample attrition was relatively high beyond 1 to\n3 years postdonation. A small single-center US study,32 and a\nlarge single-center study in Japan reported similar findings of\nhigh SF-36 scores in donors with a median or mean, respec-\ntively, of approximately 7 years postdonation.32,33 These re-\nports did not examine in detail donor concerns about the\nimpact of donation on their physical, emotional, or socio-\neconomic well-being.\nIn the present study, we surveyed liver donors who do-\nnated 3 to 10 years previously at centers participating in\nin 3 domains: perceived physical health and symptoms re-\nlated to donation, emotional well-being and response to do-\nnation, and socioeconomic concerns arising from donation.\nThe survey also assessed generic HRQOL. Key goals were\nnot only to provide descriptive information regarding these\noutcomes from a large multicenter cohort but also to exam-\nine whether demographic factors, donation-related clinical\nfactors (eg, surgical complications), and time since donation\npredicted psychosocial and HRQOL outcomes.\nStudy Design\nThe A2ALL-2 consortium consists of 9 US and Canadian\ntransplant centers (see "
