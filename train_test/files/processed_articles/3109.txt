Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among individuals with type 2\nDM may not always be due to classic diabetic glomerulosclerosis, which is associated\nwith albuminuria and retinopathy.\nObjective To determine the prevalence of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), defined\nas a GFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) in the absence of\nmicroalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy among adults with\ntype 2 DM.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of adults aged 40 years\nor older with type 2 DM in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey, a probability sample of the total civilian US noninstitutionalized population con-\nMain Outcome Measures The GFR per 1.73 m2 BSA, calculated with serum cre-\natinine, urea nitrogen, and serum albumin levels using the Modification of Diet in Re-\nnal Disease Study prediction equation; albuminuria, assessed using spot urine albumin/\ncreatinine ratio; and presence of retinopathy, determined with fundus photography.\nwith a population estimate of 1.1 million. Among these adults with CRI, diabetic reti-\nnopathy was noted in 28% (n=58), while the frequencies of microalbuminuria and mac-\nroalbuminuria were 45% (n=64) and 19% (n=47), respectively. Retinopathy and albu-\nminuria (microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria) were both absent in 30% (n=51) of\nadults with type 2 DM and CRI. The population estimate of adults with type 2 DM and\nCRI in the absence of diabetic retinopathy or albuminuria was approximately 0.3 million.\nConclusions A substantial burden of CRI among persons with type 2 DM in the United\nStates is likely due to renal parenchymal disease other than classic diabetic glomeru-\nlosclerosis. Approaches to screening renal disease in the type 2 DM population should\nincorporate assessment of GFR in addition to monitoring urine albumin excretion and\nfunduscopic changes to ensure that individuals with type 2 DM and CRI not due to\ndiabetic glomerulosclerosis will receive appropriate intervention.\nSee also Patient Page.\nbe subject to significant referral and se-\nlection bias.\nAnunbiasedestimateofthelikelihood\nofdiabeticglomerulosclerosis(vsother\nparenchymaldisease)astheetiologyof\nrenalinsufficiencyamongpatientswith\ntype 2 DM has important implications.\nFor example, the current strategies for\nscreeningandtreatmentofrenaldisease\ninpatientswithtype2DMimplicitlyas-\nsume the underlying disease process is\nuniformlydiabeticglomerulosclerosis.12\nWhile this is true for many individuals,\nour clinical experience leads us to hy-\npothesize that a substantial number of\nadults with type 2 DM and decreased\nGFR may not have diabetic glomerulo-\nsclerosis, as inferred from the absence\nof albuminuria and retinopathy.\nIn this study, we used data from a na-\ntionally representative sample of the US\npopulation to determine the frequency\nof chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), de-\nfined as a GFR less than 60 mL/min per\nabsence of albuminuria or diabetic reti-\nnopathy in adults with type 2 DM.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThe Third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nwas designed as a probability sample of\nthe total US civilian noninstitutional-\nized population 2 months of age or older\nand collected healthand nutritionaldata\nsuch as young children, older persons,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican\nAmericans,wereoversampled.Detailsof\nthe survey design may be found in the\nNHANES III operations manual.13\nDefinition of Type 2 DM\nwho were 40 years of age or older and\ncompleted a standardized interview and\na detailed physical examination.

The NHANES III did not collect in-\nformation on type of DM. Thus, we ex-\ncluded7adultswithlikelytype1DM(di-\nagnosedwithDMpriorto30yearsofage\nor continuous use of insulin), leaving a\ntotal of 1180 adults with previously di-\nagnosed type 2 DM.\nAdults who completed the examina-\ntion in the morning were instructed to\nfast for at least 9 hours, while those who\ncompleted the examination in the after-\nnoon were instructed to fast for at least\nout previously diagnosed DM, we ex-\ning serum glucose levels measured and\nas instructed. Among individuals who\nfasted appropriately and had serum glu-\ncose levels measured, 356 were classi-\nfied as having type 2 DM according to\nthe American Diabetes Association\n(ADA).14 We repeated the analyses us-\ning the World Health Organization\n(WHO) criteria to define newly diag-\nnosed type 2 DM. A 75-g oral glucose\n(76%) of adults who fasted appropri-\nately and had fasting serum glucose lev-\nels measured. Overall, 575 adults with\na fasting glucose level less than 126\nmg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) had serum glu-\nmmol/L) 2 hours (\u00b115 minutes) after an\noralglucosechallenge,leaving931adults\nclassifiedashavingnewlydiagnosedtype\n2 DM according to the WHO criteria.15\nDefinition of Retinopathy\nIn the NHANES III, photographs of the\nocular fundus of one eye were taken in\nall examined adults who were 40 years\nofageorolder,regardlessofdiabetessta-\ntus. These photographs were taken with\na nonmydriatic fundus camera (Canon\nCR4-45NM, Canon, Kanagawa, Japan),\nwhich incorporated the use of an infra-\nred video camera to allow photographs\nto be taken in a darkened examination\nroom without the use of dilating drops.\nA nonstereoscopic, color, 45\u00b0 photo-\ngraph, centered between the optic nerve\nand the macula, was taken of one ran-\ndomly selected eye, and the fundus im-\nages were then reviewed at the Univer-\nsity of Wisconsin\u00adMadison Department\nof Ophthalmology.16 The grading sys-\ntem for classifying diabetic retinopathy\nwas based on a modification of the Air-\nlieHouseClassificationScheme.17 Adults\nwith any evidence of current retinopa-\nthy (nonproliferative [mild, moderate,\nor severe] or proliferative) or previous\ntreatment for proliferative diabetic reti-\nnopathy were classified as having dia-\nbetic retinopathy.

Use of the WHO\ncriteria to define newly diagnosed type\n2 DM showed similar results.\nCurrently, almost half of all ESRD in\nindividuals initiating renal replace-\nment therapy in the United States is at-\ntributed to type 2 DM,2 and the num-\nber of individuals with type 2 DM and\nESRD is projected to almost double over\nthe next 10 years.4 Therefore, im-\nproved understanding of the etiology\nof CRI among adults with type 2 DM\nwill be paramount in controlling this\nepidemic of kidney failure.\nThe renal pathology of classic dia-\nbetic glomerulosclerosis (in both type 1\nand 2 adults) is characterized by in-\ncreased basement membrane thick-\nness, diffuse mesangial sclerosis with\nnodular formation, hyalinosis, micro-\naneurysm, and hyaline arteriolosclero-\nsis.25 These pathological lesions lead to\nalbuminuria and are accompanied by\nother systemic manifestations of micro-\nvascular disease, such as proliferative\nretinopathy.8 Among individuals with\ntype 1 DM, diabetic retinopathy is pre-\nsent in virtually all patients with dia-\nbetic nephropathy.25 However, among\npatients with type 2 DM, the concor-\ndance rate between diabetic retinopa-\nthy and nephropathy is lower.25 Never-\ntheless, the presence of retinopathy does\nsupport a diagnosis of diabetic ne-\nphropathy. Indeed, Parving et al9 stated\nthat the absence of retinopathy greatly\nreduced the likelihood that albumin-\nuria was due to diabetic glomeruloscle-\nrosis in type 1 or type 2 DM. In the ab-\nsence of retinopathy or albuminuria in\nbeticglomerulosclerosisisunlikelytobe\nthe underlying renal pathology.\nWhat could be the reason for de-\ncreased GFR in adults with type 2 DM\nwho do not have retinopathy or albu-\nminuria? A number of factors may con-\ntribute to nephron loss, including \"age-\nassociated\" renal senescence, interstitial\nfibrosis, and ischemic vascular dis-\nease, such as atherosclerotic involve-\nment of the renal artery (and smaller-\ncaliber arteries). Moreover, we agree\nwith Rychlik et al10 that cholesterol em-\nboli are likely an underappreciated con-\ntributor to the burden of CRI among pa-\ntients with type 2 DM.\nBecauseasubstantialnumberofadults\nwith type 2 DM with reduced GFR do\nnothaveretinopathyoralbuminuria,the\ncurrent strategy of screening for micro-\nalbuminuria and retinopathy alone\namong type 2 diabetic adults may not be\nsufficient for the early detection of re-\nnal disease. In addition, the serum cre-\natinine level is an insensitive measure of\nGFR loss. The National Kidney Foun-\ndation now recommends that physi-\ncians should monitor GFR22 using pre-\ndiction equations such as the MDRD\nformula20 or the Cockcroft-Gault for-\nmula26 in addition to assessing blood\npressure,funduscopicchanges,andurine\nalbumin excretion in adults with type 2\nDM.12 Thefindingsofthisstudyalsosug-\ngest that more research is needed on the\nassociationbetweenlipid-loweringmedi-\nTable 3.

In addition, clinicians\nshould be conscious of potential long-\nterm renal detrimental effects from cho-\nlesterol emboli when weighing the risks\nand benefits of endovascular proce-\ndures such as cardiac catheterization.\nThe limitations of this study include\nthe fact that only one eye was photo-\ngraphed. However, diabetic retinopa-\nthy is usually bilateral and symmetri-\ncal. In the Wisconsin Epidemiologic\nStudy of Diabetic Retinopathy, only 9%\nof the 991 adults had diabetic retinopa-\nthy in one eye, while 63% had bilateral\ndisease and the remaining adults had no\nretinopathy (oral communication, Ron-\nald Klein, MD, MPH, Department of\nOphthalmology and Visual Sciences,\nUniversityofWisconsinMedicalSchool,\ntion, the definition of diabetic retinopa-\nthy in this study included any evidence\nof previous photocoagulation for dia-\nbetic retinopathy, which would have in-\ncreased the sensitivity for detecting dia-\nbetic retinopathy.
