    "reduced_content": "The concept of hormesis, the stimulatory or adaptive responses to low doses, and\nnonlinear dose effects are becoming a more prominent and accepted concepts in\ntoxicology and risk assessment (Calabrese, 2003). While many have contributed. to\nthe concepts in hormesis, its recent prominence is largely attributable to the\ndetailed and extensive assessment of low-dose effects compiled by Ed Calabrese and\nLinda Baldwin.\nThe road to the acceptance of hormesis has been a long and hard one. Most\ntoxicologists have rejected the concept outright as irrelevant or simply ignored it or\nhave simply been ignorant of the literature. The discovery that hormetic effects are\nevident in over 40% of all studies that meet the criteria for its existence, and that\nthe effects are seen across toxins and phyla have indicated that low-dose stimulatory\neffects need to be seriously considered in toxicology and biology (Calabrese and\nHowever, what about clinical medicine? Hormesis is not as prominent a concept in\npharmacology and medicine as the title of this journal would indicate. Why is this? Is\nthe concept ofhormesis something only ofvalue in toxicology and risk assessment or\nare there wider implications? To answer this question I suggest that those interested\nin hormesis examine two areas of potential value - one area is new and largely\nunexamined, and the second is old and controversial. In examining these areas we\nshould use research and data as the discerning factors and not make the mistake of\na priori rejection like others have applied to hormesis and that set it back for so long.\nThe first area is to examine iflow--dose toxins can stimulate reparative processes\nsuch that they can used in the treatment of disease. The second is to examine the\nJonas\neffects of very low and ultralow dose stimulatory effects. Two articles in this issue of\nNon-linearity in Biology, Toxicology and Medicine allow us to comment on these areas.\nDo nonlinear effects have important clinical implications? Toxins are not always\npoisons and drugs are sometimes toxic. For example, there are several hierarchical\ndose effects ofaspirin, each with clinical implications. These include the differential\neffects of aspirin on serum thromboxane B2, gastric PGE2 output, and gastric\nmucosal injury with doses as low as 3 mg/day (Lee, 1994). High-dose aspirin\nincreases bleeding time, but very low-dose aspirin (0.01 mg/day) shows a decrease\nlated by vascular wall endothelium factors, probably prostacydin (PGI2) (Lalanne,\n1990). Some of these effects have gender differences. For example, bleeding time\nand platelet aggregation react differently in males and females at the same dose\n(Buchanan, 1983). High-dose and medium dose aspirin are used clinically to inhibit\nplatelet aggregation, but also can cause bleeding in the stomach and intestines. But\ndo the hormetic effects oflow-dose aspirin matter clinically? Could low-dose aspirin\nincrease thrombotic events in men, say after surgery, and be used to prevent gastric\nbleeding from higher doses in both genders? More studies on the effects and\nmechanisms of low and very low doses of aspirin are needed before we can answer\nthese questions, but their answers could be breakthroughs in clinical medicine.\nAnother example of the clinical utility of hormesis is me development of toler-\nance. Cellular and tissue tolerance is a commonly reported phenomenon in allergy\ndesensitization. Could a similar effect be used in developing cellular tolerance to\nenvironmental toxins? In this issue, we report on the effects oflow and ultralow-dose\nexposure of normal prostate cells to low and ultralow doses of cadmium for up to\n20 weeks (Jonas, 2003). Expression of metallothionein (MT), the primary Cd\ndetoxification protein, was induced by exposure to 10-tiMCd for over 20 weeks. Cd\npretreated cells had delayed transformation compared to controls. In addition, the\nnumber oftransformed cell mounds was lower in pretreated cells indicating that low\nand ultra-low dose exposure had protective effects to high-dose Cd induced carcino-\ngenesis. An exaggerated MT response remained even 4 weeks after growth in Cd\nfree media. Thus, it appears that a prolonged protective window of resistance to\ncellular transformation was induced by exposure to low levels of Cd. The potential\nclinical utility of this is clear. If the induction of cellular tolerance is a general\nphenomenon (like hormesis) it may be a simple and safe mechanism for protection\nfrom a variety of environmental and perhaps even terrorist toxin exposures. This\nidea is certainly not any more unlikely than hormesis seemed a decade ago.\nDo biological systems react to doses even lower than previously thought? One of\nthe major obstacles to the acceptance of hormesis has been a disbelief that very low\nCliical Utility of Hormesis\ndoses can and do have effects. Thankfully, this concept is gradually eroding as good\ndata accumulates showing otherwise. A second major obstacle to the examination\nof the clinical utility of hormesis is the association of low-dose treatment with the\ncontroversial medical system called homeopathy. The contaminating use of the\nconcept of hormesis by homeopathy in an attempt to legitimize itself has caused a\nbacklash by those interested in the science of hormesis against examining ultralow\nMisuse of the concept of hormesis by unscientific groups should not be the\ndriving factor in looking at nonlinear dose effects. Those interested in the science\noflow-dose responses should not treat ultralow doses such as traditional pharmacol-\nogy has treated hormesis. Recent reviews of the clinical research on homeopathy\nhave come to unclear conclusions (jonas, 2003). Before throwing out the bathwater,\nlet's find the baby first. While hormesis does not prove homeopathy, neither should\na fear ofhomeopathy bias scientists against looking at very low doses. Good scientific\nmethodology must remain the primary factor in determining truth, not fear of\nassociation.\nIn our prostate cell model of low and ultralow-dose Cd we found that MT was\nnot enhanced in doses below 10-6 M. However, mRNA subtype MT-IG was up-\nregulated at much lower exposures, and this subtype correlated more closely with\ndelayed transformation from high-dose Cd than any other factor. In a second\narticle in this issue, Elzbieta Malarczyk (2003) and colleagues report on t.he\nnonlinear effect of low-dose guaiacol and ethanol on the laccase and peroxidase\nactivities of two strains ofBasidiomycetes, Pleurotussajor-cajuand Trametes versicolor.\nUnlike in most studies, they continued to find nonlinear responses in dose ranges\nas low as 100-20 mol/L. One of the three reviewers of this article called for outright\nrejection. The editors of this journal, however, decided to work closely with the\nauthors to assure that their methodology was sound. After going through a\nmeticulous checklist for quality (Table) that was ultimately answered adequately\nby the authors, it was decided to accept the article for publication. No doubt some\nreaders will object to the publication of any research that claims to show effects\nbelow some predetermined level. However, if science is to prevail and if the\npotential clinical utility of hormesis is to be explored, we must guard against both\npoor methods and a priori conclusions. In all cases, however, research quality\nshould be the primary judge of value if the clinical utility of hormesis is to be\ndetermined.\nWe recommend that those doing research on hormesis, nonlinear effects in\nbiological systems, and the protective or therapeutic effect of low-dose treatments\nbegin with the quality criteria checklist in the Table of this editorial. We recognize\nthat these criteria will evolve and change as the field matures. Indeed, other\nguidelines for quality research have also been published (Linde and Jonas, 1994;\nstarting point for investigators and reviewers when investigating the topic of protec-\ntive or therapeutic hormesis.\nTable.\nJonas\nQuality Evaluation Criteria for Studies on Low-Dose Effects\nCriteria Recommended Weight\nJ.
