(November 11, 2015) The Relationship Between Access to\nIntroduction\nThe environment is associated with health issues. For instance, obesity tends to be more\ncommon in the southern United States than New England or the Pacific Northwest [1]. Various\naspects of the built environment, including the degree of development, the transportation\nnetwork, and access to food distribution points, are associated with the prevalence of\nobesity [2]. The natural environment may also be a contributor to energy balance and\nLin, et al. used weather station records to estimate climate amenable for physical activity at the\ncounty level and linked them to telephone survey data from 2002. They reported lower body\nmass indices (BMI) among those counties with the most amenable climate after controlling for\nindividual risk factors, road density, household income, and unemployment [4]. McGinn, et al.\nshowed an association between physical activity and perceived measures of the natural\nenvironment, but not to objective measures [3].\nLike the built environment [5], the natural environment is a multi-dimensional construct.\nDepending on context, it is characterized by factors such as topography, soils, hydrology,\nclimate, vegetation, and wildlife. A subset of these features were combined to create the\nNatural Amenities Scale \"based on the premise that people are drawn to areas with varied\ntopography; lakes, ponds, or oceanfront; warm, sunny winters; and temperate, low-humidity\nsummers\" [6]. It was developed primarily to study rural migration patterns [7]. However, Jilcott,\net al. used the Natural Amenities Scale to study the relationship between the environment and\nobesity in North Carolina [8]. Obesity was measured by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance\nSurvey conducted by random-digit telephone calls. They reported a negative correlation\nbetween amenities and obesity at the county level and presented some data showing that the\neffect may be mediated by physical activity. More recently, this group extended the work to\ninclude 3,106 counties in 48 states and again showed an inverse association between natural\namenities and obesity [9].\nWe sought to expand on these analyses by examining the relationship between natural\namenities and body mass measured at the individual level using data from three additional data\nsets.\nMaterials And Methods\nWe used data from over 38 million individuals to build regression models of the relationship\nbetween natural amenities and obesity while controlling for possible confounders. We\nanticipated that obesity would be less common in areas with the most attractive amenities. The\nnull hypothesis was that obesity is not associated with natural amenities. We then re-examined\nthe robustness of the model in two independent data sets that offer complementary strengths\nand weaknesses.\nData\nAmenities and Other County-Level Descriptors\nWe used descriptors of counties from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social\nResearch [10]. The data included the level of natural amenities for nearly all the counties in the\nUnited States from the ERS Natural Amenity Scale [6]. Developed by the Economic Research\nService of the Department of Agriculture, this scale reflects measures of climate and\ntopography that most people prefer: warm sunny winters, temperate dry summers, variation in\ntopography, and access to rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans [7]. The data source does not\ninclude Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands. Thirty-eight counties had values\nestimated from adjacent counties. The amenity scale is centered near zero (mean of 3,111\nwith higher values representing more attractive amenities. The interquartile range runs from -\n1.42 to +1.10. The top ten counties are all in California. The ten lowest scoring counties include\none from Indiana, three from North Dakota, and six from Minnesota.\nThe Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research data set also contains\ncounty-level estimates of the mean per capita personal income in 2005 from the US Department\nof Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Economic Information System 1969-\n2005), the 2005 unemployment rate from the US Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, Local Area Unemployment Statistics Program), the 2004 crime rate from data\ncompiled by the Uniform Crime Reporting Program at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and\nthe land area, longitude, latitude, median age, percent of residents in various racial and ethnic\ngroups, population, and number of housing units in 2005 from the US Census. Income was\nexpressed in thousands of dollars per year.\nDepartments of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Data\nWe obtained the records of drivers' licenses and non-driver identification cards from the states\nof Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, and Washington, including date of issue,\nheight, weight, age at the time of issuance, gender, and home address. The zip code of the\nhome address was coded to a specific US county. If a zip code is associated with more than one\ncounty, it was assigned to the county with the highest proportion of residential addresses from\napplied to subjects under the age of 18, and 924,684 because they were missing one or more key\nColumbia available for analysis (0.14% of DMV records contained a home address out of the\nstate of issue).\nThe University of Vermont Committee on Human Subjects and the Colorado Multiple\nInstitutional Review Board considered the data exempt from institutional review.\nGeoMed\nGeoMed is a web-based survey that recruited adults via social media and e-mail in 2014 and\n2015. Respondents provided their height, weight, age, gender, race, education, physical activity\nlevel, general health, and home address. We used the same method of determining the county\nof each address as described for the DMV data above. Of 3,191 US residents who completed the\nsurvey at the time of analysis (data collection is ongoing at\nhttps://redcap.uvm.edu/redcap/surveys/index.php?s=AgCWxtoyMX), 42 were under age 18, and\nthe District of Columbia for analysis.\nThe survey was approved by the University of Vermont Committee on Human Subjects.\nVermont Diabetes Information System (VDIS)\nThe Vermont Diabetes Information System (VDIS) was a cluster-randomized trial of a decision\nsupport system in community primary care practices [12]. Study participants were patients\nreceiving care for diabetes from 64 primary care practices in Vermont and adjacent Northern\nNew York. Patients under 18 years, receiving their diabetes care from specialists, or with\nsignificant cognitive impairment per the judgment of the primary care provider, were excluded.\nThe 7,412 VDIS subjects were contacted by telephone in random order until a sample of\napproximately 15% of the subjects from each practice agreed to participate in an in-person\ninterview, including measurement of height using a portable stadiometer (SECA GmbH,\nHamburg, Germany) and weight using a portable scale (Health O Meter LB Dial Scale\nHAP200KD-41, SunBeam, Inc., Purvis, MS). One thousand and two interviews took place\nanalyzable subjects from 19 counties in Vermont, New York, New Hampshire, and\nMassachusetts.\nThe study was approved by the University of Vermont Committee on Human Subjects #14-207.\nAnalytic approach\nWe calculated the body mass index (BMI) for each subject as their weight in kilograms divided\nby their height in meters squared. Values of 30 kg/m2 or higher were classified as obese. We\nexplored the relationship between the ERS Natural Amenity Scale and obesity graphically by\nconstructing a non-parametric locally-weighted smoothing scatterplot (LOWESS) curve [14].\nLOWESS curves do not require the a priori specification of a functional form, allowing them to\nserve as graphical descriptors of two-dimensional relationships. Because LOWESS is\ncomputationally intense, we applied it to a subset of the data consisting of 100,000 randomly\nselected DMV records. All other analyses used all available records.\nWe used logistic regression to assess the relationship between the amenity scale and obesity\n(coded as 1 for obese subjects and 0 for non-obese subjects) while controlling for potentially\nconfounding covariates. Individual-level covariates included age, gender, and year of data\ncollection (to control for secular trends in BMI). County-level covariates included latitude and\nlongitude (to control for regional variations in obesity), various social and economic\ncharacteristics of the community (median age, percent of residents in each of seven categories\nof race and ethnicity, unemployment rate, per capita income), and markers of development\n(housing density and population density).\nWe created a logistic model, including all the potential confounders using the DMV data. We\neliminated potential confounders in a backward stepwise fashion starting with the highest P-\nvalue until all remaining predictors were associated with obesity with P<0.05. We then built\nthree separate logistic models for each of the three data sources using the variables that were\nretained in the reduced model. In this way, all three models were comparable in terms of\ncovariates. We adjusted all regressions for clustering of individual subjects within counties\nusing the robust \"sandwich estimator\" method [15]. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI)\nfor each parameter and considered a two-tailed P<0.05 as evidence of statistical significance.\nResults\nthe GeoMed online survey, and 67% among the diabetic patients from the VDIS (Table 1). The\nVDIS population was also older and came from counties that had less racial diversity, lower\npersonal incomes, and much lower population and housing densities than the other sources.\nThe GeoMed respondents were younger, but otherwise generally similar to the DMV data. The\nVDIS data also had lower Natural Amenity Scores. In fact, none of the VDIS participants lived in\ncounties with scores above the mean of either of the other two groups. The distribution of land\ntypes is quite different across the three sources with most of the DMV and GeoMed data coming\nfrom the plains with the majority of VDIS data coming from highland regions.\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nPercent of resident population:\nTopography:\nTABLE 1: Characteristics of the three populations\nDMV = Department of Motor Vehicles data; GeoMed = GeoMed on-line survey data; VDIS = Vermont Diabetes Information System\ndata; SD = standard deviation; D.C. = District of Columbia\nObesity in the DMV data was associated with amenities in the LOWESS analysis. The\nprevalence of obesity was above 20% among subjects living in counties with ERS Natural\nAmenities Scale scores below 3 and below 10% where scores were above 7 (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1: Relationship of Obesity to Natural Amenities\nLocally-weighted smoothing scatterplot (LOWESS) curve based on a randomly selected subset\nIn multivariate logistic regression with the full set of confounders, the ERS Natural Amenities\nP < 0.001) (Table 2). After stepwise reduction, the reduced model included subject age and year\nof measurement as well as county-level latitude, median age, unemployment rate, and median\nincome as covariates. Obesity remained significantly associated with the ERS Natural Amenity\na one point difference in the Natural Amenity Scale is associated with a 0.6% change in the\nprevalence of obesity (Consider that Champaign in Central Illinois scores -4.5, Odessa, TX\nscores +2.5, Seattle, WA +4.5, and Clallam County, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula\nscores +6.5). Older subjects, residents of more southern counties and residents of counties with\nolder median ages and higher unemployment had higher rates of obesity.

The VDIS model had notably different odds ratios on each\nof the predictors, including a change in direction for the effect of subject age, year of data\ncollection, latitude, unemployment rate, and personal income (Tables 3-4).\nTABLE 3: Logistic regression of Natural Amenity Scale on obesity in the GeoMed data\nOR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval\nTABLE 4: Logistic regression of Natural Amenity Scale on obesity in the VDIS data\nOR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval\nDiscussion\nMajor findings\nThe natural environment, including climate and topography, is associated with obesity across a\nbroad range of populations and landscapes in America. The relationships seen here among\nlicensed drivers, holders of non-driving identity cards, respondents to a web-based survey, and\npatients with diabetes are similar to those shown using the data collected by random-digit\nThe multivariate analysis controlled for age, sex, temporal trends, county geographic position,\ndemographics, economics, and degree of development, indicating that these factors are not\nconfounding the relationship between natural amenities and obesity. Although the three data\nsources include quite different groups of subjects, they all show the same basic relationship of a\nlower prevalence of obesity at higher levels of natural amenities.\nThe differences among the three models warrant some discussion. The GeoMed survey and\nVDIS each had limited ranges of survey years, explaining why the year of data collection is not\nsignificant in those two models. Otherwise, the model based on the GeoMed survey is quite\nsimilar to that derived from the DMV data, except for differences that may be explained by the\nmuch smaller sample size. The VDIS survey, on the other hand, shows a much stronger\nassociation with the Natural Amenity Scale and different directions for most of the covariates.\nWe attribute the differences in the models to the very different nature of the population. They\nwere all chronically ill with a disease that is often caused by obesity and that may limit physical\nactivity if the patient develops complications, such as painful neuropathy of the feet or heart\ndisease. The VDIS was conducted in a relatively restricted geographic region of just 19\ncontiguous counties, nearly all of which are extremely rural. In spite of these factors, which\nmight tend to limit the effect of the environment on caloric expenditure, natural amenities\nappear protective in this population as well.\nImplications\nAlthough these data cannot conclusively demonstrate causality, one possible mechanism for\nthe role of the natural environment on obesity includes promotion of a healthier lifestyle\nthrough outdoor recreation. Other aspects of lifestyle, such as access to commercially-prepared\ncalorie-dense foods and engagement in more physically demanding occupations, are also\npossible.\nAnalyses of individual correlates of health status can help to inform prescription for personal\nhealth. In other words, some people may choose to move to locations with amenities in the\nhope that it will have health benefits. Likewise, analyses of the built environment can guide\npublic policy about urban form, building codes, and development patterns. However, the\nenvironment characteristic included in the Natural Amenities Scale generally cannot be\nmodified to suit human needs. Nonetheless, the insights from analyses of natural correlates to\nhealth can be useful. First, they lead us to explore the particular aspects of the environment\nthat are likely to be causative and help explain the mechanisms of health and disease. For\ninstance, must one live full-time in a high amenity area, or will periodic visits confer some of\nthe benefits? Second, they may inform personal decisions about where and how to live. Third,\nemployers seeking to recruit and support a healthy workforce may consider these factors in\nchoosing where to site facilities. Finally, these analyses may influence public debate about\nwhere to encourage residential development, how to allocate public lands, how to conserve\nnatural ecosystem services, the routing of highways and ecological/biodiversity corridors, and\nother health and housing policy issues.\nLimitations\nAs with all non-randomized data, the possibility of confounding by unmeasured factors limits\nour ability to discern causality. In addition, these data cannot eliminate selection bias in which\nthinner, healthier people preferentially migrate to areas with greater natural amenities,\nperhaps to take advantage of outdoor recreation. Likewise, heavier people with more health\nproblems may migrate to areas with lower amenities for medical care. However, the negative\nassociation of natural amenities with obesity persists while controlling for recreational\nfacilities [9]. Sampling bias is a possibility, although the broad use of driver's licenses by adults,\nplus the inclusion of non-driver identity cards, suggests a very generalizable sample of adults in\nthe seven states in the DMV data.\nAlthough heights and weights were measured in the VDIS data, they depend on self-report in\nthe other data sets. It is highly likely that these data underestimate the prevalence of obesity as\nthere is a systematic tendency for people to underestimate their own weight and overestimate\ntheir own height [17-18]. However, there is little reason to believe that this error is associated\nwith natural amenities, meaning that it is unlikely to be influencing estimates of the\nassociation between amenities and obesity.\nThe ERS Natural Amenities Scale was developed primarily to study rural migration patterns and\neconomic development and is well-suited to that purpose [7]. However, it includes only a\nsubset of the natural environment factors that might influence obesity and includes no\ncharacterization of the built environment. Nonetheless, it is a robust predictor of obesity in this\nand other analyses, indicating that climate and topography are important correlates of obesity.\nThis analysis is limited to adults. Although much of the American landscape is represented, the\ndata are not uniformly distributed across the country in all three data sets. Because the Natural\nAmenity Scale is not available for Hawaii and Alaska, they were not included in any of the\nanalyses. Generalizability to children or other regions of the world is very uncertain.\nThe county-level covariates, including the Natural Amenities Scale, were collected in the mid-\n2000s, but the individual data were collected over a greater period of time. Natural amenities\ngenerally change very little over time, but changes in social and economic characteristics do,\npossibly adding error. However, we saw no major changes in the estimates of the relationship\nof natural amenities to obesity in the sub-analyses by decade.\nObesity as a complex phenomenon with contributions from diet, activity, genetics, and a\nmultitude of other factors. Rather than provide a comprehensive analysis of all the causes of\nobesity, the logistic models were designed to examine the effects of potential confounders on\nthe relationship between the ERS Natural Amenities Scale and obesity. The strength of\nassociation of the potential confounders (age, sex, census characteristics, etc.) to obesity was\nnot of primary interest. Likewise, because they include only a few of the potential causative\nfactors, the logistic regression models account for only a small proportion of the variance in\nsubject-to-subject obesity, as reflected by low values for R2.\nConclusions\nThis is the largest analysis to date of the relationship of natural environmental factors to\nobesity. The very large and generalizable sample and the robustness of the main effects across\nvarious subgroups support the conclusion that residing in areas with access to natural\namenities, such as open water and a variety of topographic features as well as cool, dry\nsummers and warm, sunny winters, is associated with lower rates of obesity.\nAdditional Information\nDisclosures\nHuman subjects: The University of Vermont Committees on Human Subjects issued approval\n14-207.
