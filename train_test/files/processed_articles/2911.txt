Until recently,\nthe general consensus among policy makers and researchers has been that market power gives\nbanks proper incentives to behave prudently. The central aim of prudential bank regulation\nto reduce banks' risk taking incentives therefore often coincides with restricting competition\namong banks. Accordingly, the banking industry has been exempted from competition law\nfor a long time (Carletti & Vives (2008)). In recent years, however, several theoretical and\nempirical studies have challenged the view that monopoly power mitigates bank risk taking,\ninstead arguing that higher competition among banks leads to lower levels of bank risk.\nThe recent financial crisis, which has also been triggered by excessive bank risk taking, has\nagain heightened interest in the relationship between competition among banks, bank market\nstructure and banking stability.\nThe competition-bank risk taking nexus has been extensively analyzed in the theoretical\nbanking literature. The predictions emerging from the theoretical models are ambiguous,\nhowever. Models such as those of Keeley (1990), Allen & Gale (2004), Matutes & Vives\npetition among banks will result in higher bank risk taking. The intuition behind the result\nis straightforward: High market power at the bank level is associated with high monopoly\nrents which the bank manager wants to protect by investing in safe assets. By reversing the\nline of argument of the above models, Boyd & De Nicolo (2005) show how higher competi-\ntion among banks might lead to a reduction in the overall level of bank risk taking: Higher\ncompetition reduces interest rate costs at the level of the borrowing firm, leading the firm\nto choose a safer project which ultimately generates safer banks. Martinez-Miera & Repullo\n(2010) build a model which predicts that the effect of bank competition on bank risk taking\nis non-linear. Their model shows that under specific circumstances higher bank competition\nfirst increases bank risk taking and then reduces bank risk taking. Their model thus predicts\na reversed u-shaped relationship between bank competition and bank risk taking.\nBesides the theoretical literature, there is abundant empirical work examining the effect\nof bank competition on stability and bank risk. One strand of empirical research uses large\naggregated cross-country datasets. Beck, Demirguc-Kunt & Levine (2006), using a logit\nprobability model, find that more concentrated banking systems are less likely to experience\na banking crisis. At the same time, however, more competition also reduces bank risk. In\na similar model, employing the Panzar and Rosse H-statistic as a measure of competition,\nD\u00fcllmann, Tim Eisert, Heinz Herrmann, Ben Craig, Benedikt Ruprecht as well as participants at the Annual\nMeeting of the German Finance Association 2012 (Hannover) and the Bundesbank Seminar on Banking and\nFinance. We also thank the Bundesbank for their hospitality and the provision of data. The opinions expressed\nin this paper are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank\nor its staff.\nSchaeck, Cihak & Wolfe (2009) also find a negative relationship between the likelihood of\na systemic banking crisis and the competitiveness of the banking system. Another set of\nresearch uses (cross-country) bank-level data to examine the relationship between competition\nand individual bank risk. Boyd, De Nicolo & Jalal (2007) find that less-concentrated banking\nmarkets are characterized by lower z-scores, an inverse measure of bank risk. Jim\u00e9nez, Lopez\n& Saurina (2007) find no relationship between credit risk and market concentration but a\npositive effect of competition on credit risk, supporting the competition-fragility hypothesis.\nSchaeck & Cihak (2012) find a positive relationship between higher competition and bank\ncapital ratios. Inasmuch as better capitalized banks can be considered less risky, these results\nconfirm the competition-stability hypothesis. Berger, Klapper & Turk-Ariss (2009) find that\ncompetition in the loan market has a mitigating effect on credit risk. They also analyze\nthe effect of competition on overall bank risk and banks' capital ratios where they find\ncompetition to increase overall bank risk and decrease capital ratios. Finally, Schaeck &\nCihak (forthcoming) find in general a negative effect of competition on bank risk for European\ncountries.\nIn this study we aim at adding to the empirical literature analyzing the compe-tition-\n/concentration-risk trade-off by using bank-level data for all German banks. One of the key\nchallenges in the attempt to identify the effect of competition and concentration on bank risk\nempirically lies in defining the relevant market for each group of banks. Existing empirical\nevidence generally assumes that the relevant market for a particular bank in a given country is\nthe country itself. This implies that each bank in a given country stands in direct competition\nto all other banks in the country. While true for large, multinational banks which compete\ndirectly with one another in many markets, this assumption seems unrealistic for the majority\nof banks which operate in regional banking markets.\nWe improve on the existing literature by allowing competition to affect banks operating in\ndifferent markets in distinct ways. We use a total of three concepts to measure competition,\ncorresponding to three different dimensions at which competition might affect the risk-taking\nbehavior of banks. First, to approximate the ability of banks to generate rents by pricing\nits products over their marginal costs, we compute bank-specific efficiency-adjusted Lerner\nindexes. Second, the vast majority of banks in Germany belong either to the cooperative\nbanks sector or to the savings banks sector. These banks are by law geographically limited in\ntheir scope of activities.1 Our dataset provides us with detailed locational information for all\nGerman banks (\"three-pillar system\") so that we can exploit this special characteristic of the\nGerman banking industry to clearly define the relevant market for each specific bank in our\nsample.2 For each banking market we compute measures of concentration and contestability\nof the banking market. It is already a stylized fact that measures of concentration and\ncompetition are distinct features affecting banks in different ways. Third, we compute Boone\n1This special structure of the German banking sector is known as regional principle, \"Regionalprinzip\".\n2Besides information on bank distress and bank balance sheet data, our dataset contains the exact location\nof bank headquarters and their branches for all institutions in the German universal system.\nindicators for the next contextual level above the relevant market for banks (see also Schaeck\n& Cihak 2010). Although most German banks do not run branches outside their home county,\nthere is nothing stopping a business customer or a depositor from choosing a bank outside\nthat particular county. The Boone indicator measured at the federal state level captures\nexactly this characteristic of bank market competition.\nAnother important issue in empirical studies analyzing the relation between risk taking\nand bank competition is identifying the correct measure of bank risk. Most bank-level studies\nproxy bank risk with either some sort of credit risk (i.e., the ratio of non-performing loans\nover loans), or by the z-score introduced by Boyd & Runkle (1993). While the z-score\ncan be interpreted as the number of standard deviations by which a bank is removed from\ninsolvency, the non-performing loans ratio focuses on credit risk only. However, neither of\nthese risk indicators considers actual bank distress and bank failure events, which are without\ndoubt the most appropriate concepts to define bank risk. Our measurement of bank risk is\ncomprised from the distress database collected by the German central bank. This dataset\ncontains information on bank-level distress events that range from weak incidences to forced\nexit by means of restructuring mergers or bank moratoria. Hence, our measurement of bank\nrisk directly captures the possibility of outright bank defaults. We are not aware of any study\nemploying actual failure events as dependent variable to investigate the competition-bank risk\nnexus and we believe this is an important step forward toward a better understanding of the\nunderlying mechanisms.\nIn a second step, we use our empirical model to shed light on the role of bank competition in\nthe transmission of monetary policy shock to bank risk. There exists an increasing empirical\nliterature suggesting that loose monetary policy increases the incentive to engage in riskier\nnew investment, while at the same time reducing the risk of banks' outstanding investments.\nThe effects of monetary policy on bank risk seems to depend on the bank characteristics: low\nliquid, smaller and less capitalized banks seem to react strongest to changes in the interest\nrate. We test for hypothesis that the degree of market power influences the behavior of\nbanks in response to monetary policy shocks. The model of Dell'Ariccia, Marquez & Laeven\n2010, for instance, implies that the effect of monetary policy shocks on bank risk should be\nstronger for banks with low market power. Intuitively, a change in the market rate is reflected\nstronger in bank interest rates the lower the banks' market power of a specific banks. Hence,\nbanks with low market power have a stronger incentive to engage in riskier investment after\na reduction in the policy rate.\nOur paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the data and the methodological\napproaches to measuring bank competition at different contextual levels and to analyzing the\nbank risk taking-competition nexus. In Section 3 we present the main results of our empirical\nmodel before concluding in Section 4.\n2 Methodology and Data\nOur analysis covers the German economy and its banking system over the period 1994 to\n2010.3 Bank balance sheet data are collected from the unconsolidated balance sheet and\nincome statement reports which all banks report to the Bundesbank annually. Our measure\nof bank risk is constructed from the confidential distress database. We complement the bank-\nlevel data with macroeconomic data at the county level obtained from the German Federal\nStatistical Office. We apply a very thorough merger treatment to the dataset: After the\nmerger of two banks we artificially create a third bank (for the time after the merger) in the\nMeasuring Bank Risk\nMost existing empirical studies investigating the relationship between bank competition and\nfinancial stability at the microeconomic level focus either on credit risk alone, using some\nform of credit risk measure such as non-performing loans, or resort to bank risk measures\nconstructed from balance sheet information, such as a z-score. Bank risk measures con-\nstructed from balance sheet information, however, have the disadvantage that they do not\nprovide information on actual distress events, or even outright failures of banks. Our mea-\nsure of bank risk is comprised from the distress database collected by the Bundesbank. This\ndataset contains information on bank-level distress events that range from weaker incidences\nsuch as capital support measures by the deposit insurance schemes to outright bank defaults\n(i.e., bank moratoria or takeovers in the banking market which are classified by supervisors as\n\"distressed mergers\"). Hence, our measurement of bank risk directly captures the possibility\nof banks exiting the market because of distress events. According to Aspachs, Goodhart,\nTsomocos & Zicchino (2007), the probability of distress is a much more appealing bank risk\nstatistic because, by covering all types of risk, it provides a more exhaustive picture of risk\nborne by the banking system.\nWe consider two different concepts for defining bank distress: first we construct an in-\ndicator for broader bank distress events (Bank Distress),5 as well as one more narrowly\ndefined indicator for banks exiting the market in a distressed merger or in a moratorium\n3Note that we lose one year of data by setting the analysis in a forward-looking perspective, that is by\nforwarding bank distress and bank default events by one year with respect to the explanatory variables.\n4Note that the merger treatment causes the total number of banks in the dataset to exceed the maximum\nnumber of banks in a given time period.\n5The indicator comprises (i) capital support measures by the deposit insurance schemes in Germany,\n(ii) takeovers classified by the Bundesbank as restructuring mergers, as well as (iii) bank moratoria. Therefore,\nthe bank distress indicator applied in this study is more narrow (i.e., focusing on more severe distress events)\nthan, for example, the indicators applied in Kick & Koetter (2007) and Jahn & Kick (2011).\n(Bank Default). In order to give the analyses a forward-looking perspective, we forward\nbank distress and bank default events by one year with respect to the explanatory variables.\nTable 1: Distribution of Bank Distress and Bank Default Events\nThis table presents descriptive statistics for bank default and bank distress events obtained from the distress database\nof the Deutsche Bundesbank. The dummy variable Bank Distress refers to a broad definition of distress (including\nbanks exiting the market in a distressed merger or in a moratorium, but also capital support measures from the deposit\ninsurance funds), while the dummy variable Bank Default is an indicator for bank default (only comprising banks\nexiting the market in a distressed merger or in a moratorium). The variable z-score is calculated as the ln of the ratio\nof Tier 1 capital and operating profits of bank i to the standard deviation of operating profits where each position is\nmeasured relative to total assets. Tier 1 capital and total assets are averaged over two years (\"mid-point values\"); to\naccount for changes in the volatility of profits over time the standard deviation of operating profits is calculated over\na window of five years. The sample comprises 37,529 bank-year observations on up to 5,035 banks over the period\n1994\u00ad2010. Note that the z-score can only be calculated for a sub-sample of bank-years (because of the \"mid-point\"\ncalculation and the five-year time window).\nVariable Mean Std. Dev. Min Max N\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics on the occurrence of bank distress, bank default\nevents and the z-score for our sample of German banks (\"three-pillar system\") over the\nMeasuring Market Power\nLerner Index\nWe use the Lerner Index to approximate competition at the bank level. The Lerner Index\nrepresents the markup of prices over marginal cost; as such, the Lerner Index is a direct\nindicator of the degree of market power. A general definition of the Lerner index is\nLit =\narit -mcit\narit\nwhere arit and mcit represent the average revenues and marginal costs of bank i at time t.\nMarginal costs are derived from a translog cost function of the following form:\nln(Cit) = +\nm\nm ln(ymit)+\nm n\nmn ln(ymit) ln(ynit)+\nk j\nkj ln(wkit) ln(wjit)\n+\nm k\nmk ln(ymit) ln(wkit)+0 ln(zit)+\nm\nm ln(ymit) ln(zit)\n+\nk\nk ln(wkit) ln(zit)+ t+vit +ui. (2)\nCit represents the production costs of bank i at time t. We assume that production is based on\nthe factor inputs funding, labor and fixed capital, represented by w1it, w2it and w3it, for each\nbank i and time t. We specify three different types of bank output: customer loans, business\nloans and securities, represented by y1it, y2it and y3it. We also include bank equity capital\n(zit) as further control variable into the translog cost function. vit represents the model error\nterm and ui the bank-specific inefficiency term. Additionally we allow the production cost to\ncontain a deterministic time trend  t to capture general technological change. As usual, we\nimpose homogeneity of degree one in the input prices by dividing all factor prices and total\nproduction cost by the price of fixed capital. The model is estimated using a stochastic cost\nfrontier approach.\nUsing Equation (2), the marginal cost of bank i at time t can be calculated as\nmcit =\nCit\nym\nn\nConcerning the average revenue, it is common to approximate it by the fraction of total\nrevenue to total assets. However, unlike most other approaches to studying the relationship\nbetween bank competition and bank (in)stability, we explicitly allow for banks using less-\nthan-optimal production technology. As argued by Koetter, Kolari & Spierdijk (forthcoming),\nignoring possible inefficiencies in the production process might lead to biased estimates for\nthe Lerner Index. We follow Koetter, Kolari & Spierdijk (forthcoming) and use the sum of\nthe predicted values for total cost C from Equation (2) and the predicted profits  derived\nfrom the estimation of a profit function dual to the cost function depicted in Equation (2).\nThe estimation of the standard stochastic profit function delivers predicted values of profits of\nbank i (see Berger & Mester (1997)). These predicted profit values, as well as the predicted\ncosts of the stochastic cost frontier, are net of any inefficiencies and thus proxy the true\naverage revenue more reliably. To be specific, the average revenue arit in Equation (1) is\ncomputed as\narit =\nC +\nTotal Assets\n.\nThe evolution of our estimated Lerner Index is shown in Figure 1.\nHereby, the point estimates of the median values for each year and for each of the major\nGerman banking groups are depicted. The figure reveals that savings and cooperative banks,\nover time, enjoy a relatively stable market power (with cooperative banks having more market\npower), while private banks as well as Landesbanks show substantial fluctuation. Interest-\ningly, big private banks have been gaining market power over time, while Landesbanks were\nlosing such market power until the financial crisis in 2008 but were able to catch up with the\nbig private banks later on in 2009. Koetter & Poghosyan (2009) depict a similar evolution\nof market power for the German banking system based on latent group-specific Lerner Index\nestimates.\nFigure 1: Evolution of Competition - The Lerner Index\nLerner Index\nPrivate big\nPrivate small\nLandesbanks\nSavings banks\nCooperative banks\nCounty-level measures of concentration and contestability\nIn our analysis we aim to identify bank concentration in the relevant markets (where we\ndisaggregate our data all the way down to the regional level). Therefore, we refrain from\nmeasuring concentration based on a bank's total assets or total lending for two reasons.\nThe first reason concerns data availability, as banks' total assets represent balance sheet\ninformation which is available only at the bank level (but not disaggregated by regions). Also,\ndata on bank lending can only be traced to certain regions using the Bundesbank's credit\nregister which, however, has a substantial threshold of 1.5 million e. That is, even the use of\nlending data from the credit register would cause a substantial bias in the analysis, especially\nfor small regional banks (i.e., cooperative banks, savings banks, small private banks).\nIn order to overcome these data constraints, we measure competition by the availability of\nbank branches for private and corporate customers in certain regions. Using information on\nthe location of branches from all German universal banks we calculate the variable Regional\nGeographic Reach as the share of branches a given bank has per county; if a bank does\nbusiness in several counties, we assign the average branch share per county (weighted by the\nbank's number of branches in each county) to the specific bank. 6\n6Note that for the adequate calculation of competition measures banks which are known for operating\nextremely small branches (e.g., \"one-person counters\" in shopping centers), are dropped from the analysis.\nThe Boone Indicator\nThe central idea behind the Boone Indicator, as proposed by Boone (2000) and Boone,\nvan der Wiel & van Ours (2007), is that a more efficient bank is more profitable than less-\nefficient banks. That is, markets map efficiency differentials into profit differentials. Boone\n(2000) is able to show within a broad set of theoretical models that this mapping of efficiency\ndifferentials into profit differentials becomes steeper as competition increases. That implies\nthat the more competitive the market, the more harshly a bank is punished for inefficiencies\nin terms of relative profits. This last result enables the measurement of competition via the\nthe response of profits to changes in marginal costs.\nThe economic argumentation behind the idea of measuring the degree of competition by\nanalyzing the relationship between profit and efficiency ratios is based on the selection effect\nof competition stressed by Vickers (1995). This line of thinking holds that \"competition\ncauses efficient organizations to prosper at the expense of inefficient ones\" (Vickers 1995,\np.1). Boone (2000) argues that this selection effect is constituted by the reallocation effect\nof competition. A rise in competition reallocates output from less-efficient to more-efficient\nbanks, measured by marginal costs. Firms with lower marginal costs are able to offer their\nproduct at a lower price. Increasing competition allows efficient banks to use their cost\nadvantage more aggressively, which draws customers away from banks with higher marginal\ncosts. This effect increases the output of more-efficient banks. It is this reallocation of output\nthat raises the profits of efficient banks relative to less efficient competitors.\nThe above discussion supports the following log-linear relationship between relative profits\nand relative efficiency, measured by marginal costs (see also Boone, van der Wiel & van Ours\nln(ijt) = +jt ln(mcijt) (4)\nwhere ijt, mcijt indicate the time t profit and marginal cost of bank i located in federal\nstate j.7 The Boone Indicator, given by the parameter jt, measures the effect of changes in\nmarginal costs on profits. The specification in logs allows us to interpret the Boone Indicator\nas elasticity. As indicated by the subscript jt, we estimate the above regression separately for\neach federal state and for each year. The Boone indicator thus varies between federal states\nand over time.\nThe Boone indicator jt should generally be negative. Regardless of the degree of com-\npetition, banks with higher marginal costs are expected to realize relatively lower profits.\nFurthermore, changes in competition over time should result in appropriate changes in the\nBoone Indicator jt. This means that, according to the idea that the negative relationship\nbetween marginal costs and profit is steeper in more competitive banking markets, the Boone\n7Marginal costs are calculated, based on the estimated parameter of the translog cost function given in\nEquation (2), as shown in Equation (3).\nIndicator jt should take on higher values in absolute terms (i.e., more negative values) when\ncompetition increases.\nWe have argued above that for the majority of German banks the relevant market is indeed\nthe county the bank is headquartered in. However, although a German savings bank normally\ndoes not run branches outside its county of domicile, there is nothing stopping a customer\nor depositor from choosing a bank outside the respective county. Ignoring this manifestation\nof bank competition would surely make our approach into the competition-bank risk nexus\nunreliable. The Boone indicator measured at the federal state level captures exactly this\ncharacteristic of bank market competition.8\nSince our main dependent variable is a binary variable which indicates whether or not a\ndistress event has occurred, a natural starting point for our analysis is a binary response\nmodel. To analyze the effect of bank competition on bank risk taking, we study binary\nresponse models of the general form\nwhere P(\u00b7) is the probability that bank i at time t experiences a default event given the\nset of observable covariates xit-1, with  being fixed parameters to be estimated. In order\nto assure the exogeneity of the regressors xi and to introduce a forward-looking dimension\ninto the model, the explanatory variables are all lagged one period relative to the response\nvariable yi. The function G(\u00b7) is a link function mapping the linear index xit-1  to the\nresponse probability with support in the open unit interval. For the majority of the empirical\nanalysis, we will use the logit model as a special case of the link function G(\u00b7). Hence, we\nwill estimate models of the form:\nexp(xit-1)\nModel Specification\nTo determine the effect of the various measures of bank competition and concentration on\nbanks' probability of experiencing a distress event, we define the following baseline specifica-\ntion written in the latent response representation\ny\nit\n8It would, of course, be beneficial to estimate Boone indicators at the county level, too. This is, however,\nimpeded by the fact that for all but the largest counties the number of distinct banks per county-year is too\nsmall to reliably estimate the Boone indicator.\nThe term uit is a continuously distributed variable independent of the regressors and dis-\ntributed according to a standard logistic distribution. The population mean is given by ,\nwhile 0 and 1 are stand-ins for full sets of banking group dummy variables and time dummy\nvariables. The main focus of the empirical analysis will be on the direction of the effect of\nthe different ways of approximating Bank Competitionit-1. Since the number of potential\nbank-specific control variables Control Variablesit-1 to be included in the econometric\nmodel is immense, we orient ourselves to the existing literature, which uses the so-called\nTable 2: Summary Statistics of CAMEL Covariates\nThis table presents descriptive statistics for regulatory data obtained from the Bundesbank. The sample comprises\nprovided in the Appendix of this paper.\nVariable Mean Std.\nDev.\nMin Max N\nWe closely follow Kick & Koetter (2007) and De Graeve et al. (2008) and specify ten\nCAMEL covariates. The upper panel of Table 2 shows summary statistics for the CAMEL\ncovariates used in our baseline specification, which closely resembles the specification used in\nthe existing literature on bank default prediction.\nIn this section we present regression results from our empirical models. Hereby, we investigate\nthe competition-bank risk taking nexus on its own (including robustness with alternative risk\nmeasures), we address potential endogeneity concerns of the Lerner Index, and we examine\nthe interactions of competition measures with monetary policy.\n3.1 Bank Risk and Competition\nColumn one of Table 3 shows the results of the baseline logit regression. The model specifi-\ncation closely follows the standard bank rating model used at the Bundesbank. This model\nsetup has performed reasonable well (see Kick & Koetter 2007 and Porath 2006). Although\nnot shown, all regressions include time-specific and banking group dummies for large banks\n(i.e., big private), Landesbanks, central cooperative banks, savings banks, and small private\nbanks (the reference group being cooperative banks) as further controls. We first present\nthe results without including any measure of competition or concentration in order to see\nwhether the pure model produces reasonable results.\nThe results for the CAMEL covariates are in line with the existing literature. The ratio\nof bank equity to total assets, and bank reserves to total assets are measures of the degree\nof capitalization of banks. As expected, better-capitalized banks have a lower probability\nof default (PD) relative to the sample mean. The dummy variable indicating the presence\nof hidden liabilities as well as the dummy variable indicating that the bank has reduced its\nreserves in the current reporting year have a positive and highly significant coefficient. The\nGerman institutional framework allows banks to build up hidden liabilities in the balance\nsheet instead of writing off problem loans. Hidden liabilities thus indicate the existence of\nproblem loans in the credit portfolio which, in turn, increases the overall riskiness of the bank\nas indicated by the positive coefficient. The share of customer loans as well as the sectoral\nconcentration of the business loan portfolio both have a negative effect on the probability\nof experiencing a distress event. We interpret both measures as indicators of the degree of\nspecialization of a bank. The finding that more specialized banks are on average less risky is in\nline with the findings provided by Jahn & Kick (2011). The profitability of banks, measured\nby return on equity, reduces the likelihood of a distress event, while the share of fee income\nhas a risk-increasing effect. The share of fee income is a measure of the engagement of a\nbank in non-traditional banking activities. The income generated by non-traditional banking\nactivities is generally riskier and less stable compared to more traditional types of banking\nbusiness. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans is an ex post measure of realized\ncredit risk. As expected, higher non-performing loans increase PD. We also include the ratio\nof off-balance sheet activities to total assets in our baseline specification. Off-balance sheet\nitems mainly comprise credit commitments, which may bear risks if numerous customers\ndraw simultaneously on these lines. Indeed, the positive and significant coefficient indicates\nthat higher off-balance sheet activities increase the the likelihood of a experiencing a distress\nIn columns two to four we add, one at a time, our indicators of the different dimensions\nof market power and market concentration discussed in the previous section, while in column\nfive we add all the indicators simultaneously.\nIn column two we add to the baseline specification the Lerner Index which measures the\nability of each single bank to price its products above the marginal costs. The point estimate\nof the Lerner Index has a negative and highly significant effect on the distress probability of\nbanks. Increasing the pricing power of banks (reducing competition) significantly reduces the\nlikelihood of a distress event. The risk-reducing effect of bank-level market power is thus in\nline with the \"competition fragility\" or \"franchise value\" view of the competition-bank risk\ntaking nexus: more intense competition between banks reduces the charter value of banks\nand thereby encourages banks to take more risk. This result thus supports the majority of\ntheoretical studies in the bank competition-stability trade-off literature that predict a risk-\nincreasing effect of competition (e.g. Keeley 1990, Matutes & Vives 2000, Hellmann, Murdock\nWe want to emphasize that the risk-reducing effect of bank-level pricing power is neither\ndriven by an efficiency story, nor by a business model or risk-level story. First, we inten-\ntionally computed a Lerner Index which takes into account that banks often operate using\nless-than-optimal production technology. The Lerner Index is, therefore, not biased by any\ninefficiencies at the bank level. Second, our set of exogenous variables controls sufficiently\nwell for heterogeneity across banks arising from differences in the degree of specialization of\nbanks. To make this point concrete, if the degree of specialization (or generally the business\nmodel) is not properly accounted for, it is possible that the Lerner Index will capture varia-\ntion in the degree of specialization between banks. Banks specializing in providing loans to\na certain group of borrowers might be able to set loan rates at a markup which would result\nin a higher Lerner Index. The variable sectoral concentration of credit portfolio controls for\nthis channel. Finally, we also control for a large array of different risk categories. While the\nshare of non-performing loans controls well for the ex-post realized risk in the balance sheet,\na reserve reduction and the presence of hidden liabilities control for possible assumed but not\nyet fully realized risk. A similar argument applies to the off-balance sheet activities of banks:\na high level of off-balance sheet activity might indicate higher bank risk which is, however,\nunobservable when exclusively relying on balance sheet information.\nIn column three we add the variable Regional Geographic Reach. This variable cor-\nresponds to a measure for a bank's market power at the regional level. Given that for the\noverwhelming majority of banks in Germany the relevant banking market is the county the\nbank is located in (either by law or size of the bank) this variable can therefore be interpreted\nas direct market-specific indicators of competition. The positive and highly significant co-\n9For variable descriptions see also the Appendix of this paper.\nefficient on the market share indicator supports the conclusion that a higher market share\nof bank branches is positively related to bank instability in the regional market. The risk\nincreasing effect of a higher market share in the regional market stands in contrast to the\nrisk reducing effect of higher pricing power at the bank level measured using bank-specific\nLerner Indexes. One possible interpretation of this result is that banks with a large branching\nnetwork might be \"too-big-to-fail\" for this particular regions. Moral hazard issues associated\nwith the \"too-big-to-fail\" paradigm might lead those banks to pursue riskier projects. Indeed,\nDam & Koetter (2012) show that there exists a strong moral hazard behavior among German\nbanks which can be explained by political economy considerations at the regional level.\nIn column four we add the Boone Indicator of competition. In the way we have calculated\nthe Boone Indicator, it is a competition measure which varies across the 16 federal states\nin Germany. The point estimate of the Boone Indicator variable is positive and highly\nsignificant. Recall that the Boone indicator measures how harshly banks are punished in\nterms of profits for being inefficient. Higher values of the Boone Indicator imply that a\nspecific market allows banks to generate relatively high profits (although being relatively\ninefficient), thereby indicating that the market is characterized by a low degree of competitive\npressure. A positive coefficient of the Boone indicator thus implies that banks operating in\nlow-competition banking markets have a higher probability of experiencing a distress event.\nThis result is in line with Schaeck & Cihak (2010), who also find that increasing competition,\nmeasured by the Boone Indicator, has a tendency to reduce risk taking at the bank level.\nIn the last column we add all four distinct measures of competition simultaneously into the\nmodel. Since all of the competition indicators are meant to measure the degree of competition,\nthe question emerges as to whether they measure the same effects or whether each of these\nvariables has a direct and independent effect on bank risk-taking. Apparently they do all\nhave independent effects on bank risk: each of the three variables remains highly significant\nand retains its original effect on bank risk-taking.\nThe result that higher competition, measured using the Boone Indicator, reduces bank\nrisk might seem to be at odds with the result that higher competition measured using a\nbank-specific Lerner Index increases bank risk. However, both indicators are measuring very\ndifferent dimensions of bank competition. On the one hand, the (in-)efficiency adjusted\nLerner Index captures reasonably well the possibility of banks to generate profits purely by\nextracting monopoly rents. The Boone Indicator, on the other hand, indicates how strongly\nthe market punishes banks for inefficiencies. This gives rise to a different channel through\nwhich competition affects the probability of default: more competitive banking markets, as\nindicated by lower values of the Boone Indicator, are dominated by more efficient banks as\ncompetition drives out the less efficient banks (see also Schaeck & Cihak 2010 and Turk Ariss\n2010 for empirical evidence that bank competition increases efficiency in banking). There\nexist theoretical arguments as well as empirical evidence that more efficient banks are less\nrisky. First, Petersen & Rajan (1995) argue that more efficient banks have better screening\nand monitoring abilities. At the empirical front, Berger & DeYoung (1997) show that more\nTable 3: Bank Distress and Competition\nThis table shows regression results from logit models.

Taken together with our finding that\nthe Boone Indicator has a negative effect on bank risk taking suggests that competition\nhas a stability enhancing effect via an improvement in bank efficiency, and more specifically\nby improving banks' monitoring and screening procedures (see Schaeck & Cihak 2010 for a\nsimilar argument).\nViewed from a more theoretical angle, the result that higher pricing power reduces bank\nrisk taking supports the idea that higher franchise values mitigate the risk-shifting incentives\nof banks, thus contributing to a more stable banking system. Simultaneously, higher bank\ncompetition reduces risk-shifting incentives at the borrower level by forcing banks to develop\nmore efficient screening and monitoring mechanisms.\nRobustness with Bank Default and Alternative Risk Measures\nTable 4 contains robustness checks of our results against changing the bank distress to a bank\ndefault measure. As explained in greater detail in Section 2, a distress event consists of either\na direct capital injection into the bank, a distressed merger event, or a moratorium. Since the\ndistressed merger and moratoria events are the strongest default events in our dataset, we\ncheck whether the effect of competition and concentration on the distress probability changes\nwith the severity of the distress event. One might argue, for instance, that it is especially the\nmost risky banks which benefit from an increase in their pricing power.\nColumn one is just a replication of the results of the full benchmark model from Table 3\nwhich we present here for the convenience of the reader. The results presented in column two,\nhowever, indicate that increasing the bank-level pricing power - that is, increasing the Lerner\nIndex - no longer has a risk-reducing effect when concentrating on the probability of a distress\nmerger or a moratorium (i.e., focusing the analysis on actual bank defaults). The same holds\nfor the Boone Indicator. While more competitive behavior in the (more broadly defined)\nbanking market, i.e. a lower Boone Indicator, has a risk-alleviating effect in the benchmark\nregression, the Boone Indicator has no significant effect on the default probability of banks.\nIn this regression, the sign of the variable Regional Geographical Reach changes, too,\nindicating that a higher market share of bank branches reduced the probability of a bank\ndefault (even when it does positively affect weaker forms of bank distress, as shown in the\nbaseline regressions in Table 3).\nIn column three we present regression results using the z-score as the dependent variable.\nThe z-score is a widely used variable in the empirical banking literature to approximate the\noverall level of banks. The success of the z-score can mostly be attributed to the fact that\nit can be easily calculated from banks' balance sheet information. Although we think that\nusing actual distress events is more appropriate when trying to study the competition-risk\nnexus, we present, for reasons of comparability with the existing literature, the results for\nthe z-score model in the third column of Table 4.10 In general, the results from the z-score\nfixed-effects OLS regressions are qualitatively similar to those of the logit model. Note that,\nsince the z-score increases with the soundness of banks, a positive coefficient indicates a risk-\nreducing effect - in contrast to the logit model where a negative coefficient indicates lower\nrisk. A few differences are worth noting: First, neither the level of reserves nor the dummy\nfor hidden liabilities exerts a significant effect on risk. The insignificance of bank reserves and\nthe hidden liabilities dummy is very counterintuitive given the importance of these variable\n10The z-score is calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital and operating profits of bank i to the standard\ndeviation of operating profits where each position is measured relative to risk weighted total assets. To take\ninto account that capital and total asset positions are end-of-year figures while profits are within-year flows,\nTier 1 capital and total assets are averaged over two years (i.e., we calculate \"mid-point values\"). To account\nfor changes in the volatility of profits over time, the standard deviation of operating profits is calculated over\na window of three years. Taking the natural logarithm of the z-score ensures that results are not driven by\nextreme values.\nin the German banking landscape. However, given the drawbacks of the z-score, we do not\ngive too much weight to these results.\nFinally, the last column in Table 4 contains the results from a model which specifies\nthe non-performing loans ratio as dependent variable. The non-performing loans ratio is\nthe single most important determinant of a bank's credit risk. The results of this model\nshow that higher market power at the bank level reduces bank risk-taking via the credit\nportfolio, that is, banks with a higher Lerner Index seem to choose to finance safer projects.\nAt the same time, and mirror imaging the previous results, competition measured by the\nBoone Indicator suggests that lower competition increases credit risk-taking of banks. The\ncoefficient of our competition measure related to the banks' home county has a negative sign,\nindicating that banks with more market power in the relevant banking market take out safer\nloans. This is in contrast to the results from the broad distress measure but might help\nreconcile the finding that banks with higher regional market power have a lower probability\nof outright bank failure. However, the coefficient of the variable Regional Geographic\nReach is not significantly different zero. One possible reason for this finding might be\nneglected endogeneity of the Lerner Index with respect to the risk measures used, an issue\nwhich we address next.\nTable 4: Robustness with Alternative Bank Risk Measures\nThis table shows robustness regression results from logit (column (1) and (2)) models. Column (1) is just a replication\nof the results of the full benchmark model from Table 3 (in which a dummy variable for bank distress, Bank Distress, is\nused as the dependent variable), column (2) shows results for a dummy variable indicating distressed bank mergers and\nmoratoria, i.e. Bank Default, on the left-hand side of the regression. Column (3) reports results from fixed-effects OLS\nregressions with the z -score as dependent variable. Column (4) reports results from fixed-effects OLS regressions with\nthe non-performing loans to total loans (NPL) as dependent variable.

YES YES\nEstimation Methods and Endogeneity Issues\nA valid concern to the results presented so far is the potential endogeneity of the Lerner\nIndex. Schaeck & Cihak (2010), for instance, argue that the level of bank risk might also\naffect the competitive conduct of banks. Banks facing a high probability of default, in an\nattempt to \"gamble for resurrection\", might try to attract new businesses by aggressively\npricing its products, ultimately affecting measures of bank competition such as the Lerner\nIndex. One might argue that our modeling approach mitigates endogeneity issues by including\nthe explanatory variables with a lag of one period. However, endogeneity between bank risk\nand bank competition might still be an issue if bank managers form expectations about\ntheir default probability and anticipate future distress events. Our strategy to deal with\nthe endogeneity of the Lerner Index is to instrument the Lerner Index with appropriate\ninstrumental variables.\nFollowing Koetter, Kolari & Spierdijk (forthcoming) and motivated by the dynamic panel\nliterature (e.g. Blundell & Bond 1998), our first instrumental variable consists of the lagged\nvalues of the Lerner Index. The second set of instruments consists of the bank's home\ncounties' ability to bear debt (debt sustainability). The idea behind this instrument is that\nGerman counties rely heavily on (local) banks to cover their (short term) financing need,\nwith savings banks and Landesbanken having a predominant position in this market. We\nreckon that banks located in more indebted counties have different opportunities to exert\npricing power against the public sector. On the other hand, given that German counties\ncannot default, there should not be a direct relation between the relative indebtedness of\ncounties and the probability of default at the bank level. Our final two sets of instruments\nconsist of the share of bank employees relative to the overall credit portfolio and of the\nHerfindahl-Hischmann-Index (HHI) of bank branches at the regional level.11\nWe present the results from our Instrumental Variables (IV) approach in Table 5. We\nuse both, a two-step IV-probit approach (column (1) and column (3)) and an IV linear\nprobability model (column(2) and column(4)). The first two columns correspond to the\nmodel using the broader distress definition as dependent variable (Bank Distress) while\nthe third and the fourth column use the distress definition taking into account only outright\nbank failures (Bank Default). We also estimated our benchmark regressions using simple\nlinear probability models and probit models (results not shown): the results from these\nrobustness checks, available upon request, leave the main message of the previous results\nunaltered. For completeness we also present the results of the IV regressions of the models\nusing the z-score and the non-performing loans ratio as dependent variables.\nThe results of IV-probit regression using the broader distress measure (column (1)) tell the\nsame story as the simple logit approach of the previous sections: Increasing bank-level pricing\npower reduces the probability of experiencing a distress event, providing further support for\nthe competition-fragility hypothesis. Simultaneously, more concentrated banking markets\nare, ceteris paribus, characterized by riskier banks. Finally, banks located in states with\na lower competitive conduct, i.e. higher values for the Boone Indicator, have also higher\ndistress probabilities. Results are slightly different when applying the IV-linear probability\nmodel. The Lerner Index and the Boone Indicator enter significantly and have their familiar\nsigns (negative and positive, respectively). In contrast, the variable measuring the market\n11Clearly, the HHI index is conceptually similar to the variable Regional Geographic Reach. We therefore\ntested the validity of including the HHI in the set of excluded instruments, besides the more formal test\npresented below, by including the HHI directly into our benchmark regression. The results support our choice\nsince the HHI never entered the model with a significant coefficient.\ncontestability/concentration, although still positive, looses its significant effect. Concerning\nthe results of the IV-regressions employing the narrowly defined distress indicator (column\n(3) and column (4)), we again find that all our previous results remain valid when applying\nan IV-probit approach (column(3)). The same hold for the IV-linear probability model,\nexcept that the Lerner index remains significant (column(4)). Column (5) and column (6)\npresent the results from IV regressions when using as dependent variable the z-score and\nthe non-performing loans ratio, respectively. Again, the findings of the previous sections are\nconfirmed. Furthermore, the negative coefficient of the Regional Geographic Reach is now\nsignificant at the 10% level.\nThe lower part of Table 5 presents formal tests on the validity of our IV setup. Note that\nwe only present results for the test statistics based on the linear probability model simply\nbecause these test are not properly defined in a (non-linear) probit framework. The first\ntest statistic correspond to the relevance of the instruments, that is whether the instrument\nvariables are sufficiently correlated with the bank lending rate. We report the Wald F-\nstatistic based on the Kleinbergen-Paap rk statistic. The results show that the F-statistic is\nwell above the commonly used critical value of 10 in all model setups. A F-statistic well above\n10 is generally viewed as indication that instrument weakness is not a major problem.12 The\nHansen J-test concerns the validity of the instruments; that is, whether they are uncorrelated\nwith the error term of the main equation. The null hypothesis is that the instruments can\nbe excluded from the main equation. The result indicates that we can not reject the null\nhypothesis in neither one of the regressions but in the regression when using the narrowly\ndefined distress measure as dependent variable. However, it is also this regression model\nwhere the test on the exogeneity of the Lerner Index cannot be rejected, suggesting that\nthe Lerner Index can be treated as exogenous to outright bank failures. For all other risk\nmeasures the test on the exogeneity of the Lerner Index is rejected.\n12Note that the values of the Kleinbergen-Paap statistic are identical in both IV linear probability models\nsimply because in both models the first stage regressions are identical.\nTable 5: Sensitivity to Estimation Method and Endogeneity Issues\nThis table shows regression results from IV-probit models and IV-linear-probability-models (IV-LPM): a two-step\nIV-probit approach is shown in (column (1) and column (3)) and an IV-LPM in (column (2) and column (4)). The\nfirst two columns correspond to the model using the broader distress definition as dependent variable (Bank Distress)\nwhile the third and the fourth column use the distress definition taking into account only outright bank failures (Bank\nDefault).

A growing empirical literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy\nhas shown that heterogeneity in the balance sheet health of banks is an important factor\ndetermining the strength of the transmission of monetary policy to bank risk. Specifically,\nlow capitalized and low liquid banks seem to react strongest to monetary policy shocks. The\nrole of banks' market power in shaping the response of banks to monetary policy shocks in\nterms of bank risk is however largely unexplored. Table 6 show regression results tackling\nthis issue.\nIn column (1) in Table 6 we show the results from our benchmark specification estimated\nusing a linear probability model in which we replace the time dummies with four key macroe-\nconomic variables (the first differences of the short term interest rate (IR), real GDP\n(GDP), the consumer price index (P) as well as the level of the long rate/short rate\nspread).13 The results in column (1) show that loose monetary policy reduces the probabil-\nity of experiencing a distress event. This finding is line De Graeve, Kick & Koetter (2008)\nand suggests that expansionary monetary policy improves the financial/economic conditions\nof banks existing borrower. This in turn translates into a lower overall probability of bank\ndistress. Note that this finding is not necessarily inconsistent with the risk taking channel of\nmonetary policy. Our data does not allow to distinguish banks new business activity from\nits outstanding investments. Hence, it is possible that banks shift their new investment into\nriskier segments. Instead, our result show that expansionary monetary policy lowers banks'\noverall distress probability. In this sense, the risk reducing effect of monetary policy on the\noutstanding business of banks seems to outweigh potential negative effects on banks new\nactivities; see Buch, Eickmeier & Prieto (forthcoming) for a similar finding and discussion.\nTo investigate the effect of changes in monetary conditions on bank risk through bank\ncompetition and market power we add in column (2) to (7), one at a time, the interaction of\nthe change in the short term interest rate with the different competition measures. Column\n(2) and column (3) show that the positive effect of a higher short term interest rate on banks\ndistress probability is weakened by higher market power as measured by the Lerner index.\nHence, this finding suggest that banks competitive position is an important feature in the\ntransmission of monetary policy changes to bank risk. Furthermore, our results are consistent\nwith the theoretical hypothesis of Dell'Ariccia, Marquez & Laeven (2010) that banks with\nmore market power change the risk profile of their balance sheet less following a change a\nmonetary policy. Conversely, as shown in column (6) and column (7) the Boone indicator\nsuggests that banks located in markets with less competitive pressure react stronger to interest\nrate changes. A tentative interpretation of this finding is that a low competitive pressure, as\nindicated by a higher Boone indicator, also reflects a low degree of market discipline in these\n13We use the linear probability instead of the logit model due to the well known difficulties in interpreting\ninteraction effects in non-linear regression models such as logit models.\nbanking markets, in the sense of allowing banks to engage in riskier projects without being\npunished by customers.\nWe performed a number of robustness analysis related to Table 6. First, to make sure\nthat the change in the short term interest rate is a reasonable good indicator for monetary\npolicy shocks, we re-estimated the model using a Taylor rule residual as alternative indicator\nfor monetary policy shocks. The results are very similar. We therefore decided to report only\nthe results using the change in the short term interest rate because it is the simpler measure.\nFurthermore, we also interacted the competition measures with the long-short spread and,\nto control for potential correlation of the competition measures with other bank specific\ncontrols, we also included (alongside the competition-interest rate interactions) interaction of\nthe monetary policy indicator with the equity ratio and bank reserves. The results from these\nrobustness checks, which are available on request, do not materially alter the main results\npresented above.\nTable 6: Bank Risk, Competition and Monetary Policy\nThis table shows regression results from LPM. All regressions, although not shown, include the same set of bank level control variables\nas in the regressions shown in Table 3 to Table 5. The dependent variable is a binary variable indicating the occurrence of a distress\nevent as defined by the dummy variable Bank Distress. Column (1) shows the results from the baseline regression, in columns (2)/(3)\nthe Lerner*IR transmission (without/with time dummies) is added, in columns (4)/(5) we add the Regional Geo.

An increasingly competitive envi-\nronment caused by the growing internationalization of financial markets and the emergence\nof non-bank players in the market for corporate financing has often been seen as contribut-\ning to increasing banks' incentives to take risks. This perception of the effects of higher\ncompetition on bank risk is confirmed by a large array of theoretical and empirical banking\nmodels. Using unique regulatory data available from the Bundesbank we revisit the bank\ncompetition-stability nexus.\nWe improve on the existing literature along three crucial dimensions. First, in contrast\nto other bank-level studies, we use the most direct measure of bank risk available. Our\nmeasurement of bank-level risk is generated from the distress database collected by the Bun-\ndesbank. This dataset contains information on bank distress and bank default events (i.e.,\ndistressed bank mergers and bank moratoria). Hence, our measurement of bank risk directly\ncaptures the possibility of a bank defaulting. We concur with Aspachs, Goodhart, Tsomo-\ncos & Zicchino (2007), who correctly state that the probability of bank default is the most\nappealing bank risk statistic because, by considering all types of risks, it provides a more\nexhaustive picture of risk borne by the banking system.\nSecond, the richness of our dataset allows us to control for a wide array of different\ntime-varying characteristics of banks which are likely to influence the competition-risk taking\nchannel. We control for a number of different dimensions of risk at the bank level while de-\ntermining the effect of competition on the probability of default. Besides measures of realized\nrisk, we also have at our disposal measures of potential risks assumed by banks which have,\nhowever, not yet materialized. Furthermore, our dataset contains detailed information on\nthe business model of banks. Ignoring the time-varying heterogeneity induced by differences\nin business model might distort the assessment of the risk taking-competition relationship.\nFinally, in an approach to take existing empirical evidence seriously, we allow competition\nto affect the probability of default along four different dimensions. We include different\nmeasures of competition, contestability and concentration, each corresponding to a different\ncontextual level of a bank's competitive environment.\nThe main messages which emerge from our empirical analysis can be summarized as fol-\nlows. An increase in the market power of banks at the level of the individual institution,\nmeasured via (in)efficiency-adjusted Lerner Indexes, tends to reduce the probability of de-\nfault of that bank. This result is thus consistent with the majority of theoretical contributions\nshowing that a reduction in the pricing power of individual banks due to fiercer competition\nleads to increasing bank risk. In contrast, our competition measures applying to the level of\nthe bank market (i.e., measuring competition via geographical reach and the Boone Indica-\ntor at the county and federal state level) tend to indicate that a more competitive market\nenvironment goes hand in hand with a lower level of bank risk. Thus, when looking upon\ncompetition as altering the working mechanism at the (relevant) market level (which must not\nnecessarily be a one-to-one mapping to the ability of banks to price products over marginal\ncosts), our evidence supports the recent theoretical and empirical contributions stressing the\ntransmission channels which lead to a risk-reducing effect of higher bank competition.\nInvestigating the competition-bank risk taking nexus we confirm that loose monetary pol-\nicy improves the financial/economic conditions of a bank's existing borrower which translates\ninto a lower overall probability of bank distress. Building on these results we find that a higher\ndegree of market power measured by the Lerner index reduces the effect of monetary policy\non bank risk which is consistent with the idea that bank with more market power are more\nreluctant changing the risk profile of their balance sheet following a change a monetary policy\n(simply because their can already extract large rents). Conversely, the Bonne indicator sug-\ngests that banks located in markets with less competitive pressure react stronger to interest\nrate changes.\nFrom a policy perspective, our results indicate that competition-reducing regulation (e.g.,\nartificial entry barriers) does not necessarily enhance the stability of individual banks. In-\nstead, our results show that the degree of competition affects bank risk in a manifold number\nof ways, some of them with stability-enhancing effects, but others apparently without such\neffects.\nReferences\nAllen, F. & Gale, D.
