    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhat does the abundance of data and proliferation of data-making methods mean for the ordinary person, the person on\nthe street? And, what could they come to mean? In this paper, we present an overview of a year-long project to examine\njust such questions and complicate, in some ways, what it is to ask them. The project is a collective exercise in which we\n\u00ad a mixture of social scientists, designers and makers \u00ad and those living and working on one street in Cambridge (UK),\nTenison Road, are working to think through how data might be materialised and come to matter. The project aims to\nbetter understand the specificities and contingencies that arise when data is produced and used in place. Mid-way\nthrough the project, we use this commentary to give some background to the work and detail one or two of the\ntroubles we have encountered in putting locally relevant data to work. We also touch on a methodological standpoint we\nare working our way into and through, one that we hope complicates the separations between subject and object in data-\nmaking and opens up possibilities for a generative refiguring of the manifold relations.\n",

To what end?\nAnd when and where might it be put to use? To put it\nanother way, how might data like this \u00ad the flows of\ntraffic on a mostly residential road \u00ad come to matter?\nWhere might it matter and to whom?\nIt is precisely this line of questioning around data\nmattering that has motivated a year-long project we\n(a mixture of social and computer scientists, and\ndesigners) are embarking on with the people living\nand working on Tenison Road. The project, handily\ncalled the Tenison Road project, stems from some trou-\nbles we have had with all the excitement about data\nbeing reported in the popular press and matched by\nat least some of the claims coming from our academic-\nally minded colleagues. It is hard not to open a news-\npaper, or for that matter a journal issue or conference\nproceedings, without seeing some quite fantastic stories\nstemming from a deluge of data of one sort or another.\nAt one extreme, we have some pretty exaggerated\nclaims envisioning data and especially Big Data as the\nfinal answer for understanding just about anything that\nhas been, hitherto, too complex to understand. At the\nother, we see an abundance of stories predicting that a\nsurveillance society, afforded by the proliferation of\npersonal data and hyperconnectivity, is set to dismantle\ncivic life as we know it. The trouble is that these it must\nbe said not altogether unwarranted concerns (see\nSolove, 2011) tell us very little about how ordinary\nfolk make sense of data and how they might put it to\nuse if they had a choice. They say very little, if you will,\nabout what data might be on the street.\nSo, the Tenison Road project is in some small and\nconcentrated way a means to examine how data could\ncome to matter in a place and amongst people with\nsome very real ideas and concerns.

As such, the work represents an\neffort to understand data as coming from somewhere\nand intended for someone \u00ad notably in contrast to how\nit seems in much of the Big Data rhetoric as `raw' and\nsomehow from nowhere and for no one in particular\n(Mackenzie, 2006). It is then, to use a very particular\ncase, to think about not just technology development\nbut broader themes in social life, such as privacy and\ndata protection; the freedom of access to data; civic\nparticipation and engagement; data-related policy\nmaking; and generally how data might enable fuller\nand hopefully better lives for citizens.\nSo, what is it we are doing exactly? For five months\nnow (beginning in November 2013), we have been\nmeeting, monthly, with some of Tenison Road's resi-\ndents \u00ad those who have chosen to respond to our flyers,\nposters and emails (we have over 60 people we are in\nemail contact with and the meetings have between 20\nand 30 residents who regularly attend). Over that time,\nwe have collectively spoken about how data might be\nrelevant to Tenison Road and what matters to the\n`community' (a term that is itself contested). These dis-\ncussions are giving rise to several threads of activity\nincluding monitoring traffic volumes, noise levels and\nair quality; building an archive of the road's social his-\ntory; and recording particular aspects of contemporary\nlife such as residents' movements, plant/wildlife, etc.\nIn gradually building up these disparate forms of\ndata, the aim has been to figure out how they should\nserve the collective interests of Tenison Road. To this\nend we have, together with the community, been work-\ning with different ways of storing, aggregating and\nvisualising the data. Again, the overarching ambition\nhas been to examine how data might come to matter to\nthe range of people who live and work on a street.\nNaturally, such an ambition has surfaced tensions\naround the data we are collecting, how we are collecting\nit, who has rights to it, and how forms of authority,\ncontrol, omission, absence, etc. are performed through\nwhat we might think of as these collective activities of\n`the materiality of code-work'. Furthermore, they have\nshown the manifold meanings that data can come to\nhave when put to work in everyday life. Let us offer a\nparticular cut through our activities to provide a fla-\nvour of the tensions and multiplicities.\nThe traffic-related data we are beginning to record is,\nin fact, motivated by significant changes that are under-\nway at the southern end of Tenison Road, where it\nintersects with the approach to Cambridge's one and\nonly railway station. At its formal opening in 1889, the\nroad ended some way from the station, separated by\nFigure 1. Graphs of (a) density of traffic and (b) direction of traffic along Tenison Road on 25 February 2014. Vertical lines in graph\n(a) indicate a journey counted so that darker areas are busier than lighter ones (the two relatively wide white gaps represent short\nperiods when the system was down). The uniform grey area in graph (b) indicates number of journeys South, the lighter hashed area\nindicates journeys North and the darker hashed area is their intersection.

Over time, the road extended and came to be\nan important and well-used thoroughfare between West\nCambridge, to the north, and Cambridge Railway\nStation, to the south. Today, as the residents regularly\nlament, the road is used as a rat run for commuter\ntraffic and especially taxis that service the station\n(Figure 2).\nTraffic monitoring surveys had been commissioned\nin 2012 by Cambridge County Council on behalf of the\nresidents to assess the severity of the problems and\njudge whether any re-design of the road network\nmight alleviate traffic volumes. These surveys in part\nroad-calming measures, but to date no decisions have\nbeen made as to what these might be. Since the surveys,\nhowever, a set of far more significant planned changes\nto the station area have given rise to yet further anxi-\neties for the community. Ongoing building work and\nrecently granted planning permission (of both offices\nand residential flats) near the station will dramatically\nincrease the numbers of people passing through the\narea. The residents association that Tenison Road resi-\ndents are active in, GTARA, estimates the increase in\ndaily footfall from the proposed office space alone to be\nin the order of 1500 people. Furthermore, the re-plan-\nning of the area includes a re-routing of traffic so that\nthe southern end of Tenison Road becomes the primary\nstation access road for taxis and private vehicles.\nUnderstandably, then, there are members of the\ncommunity who are deeply concerned and looking for\nways to have some recourse with both the County\nCouncil and the developers. It is in this context that\nthe Tenison Road project was launched and thus it is\nhardly surprising that traffic monitoring was very\nquickly raised as a candidate for thinking about data\nand how it might be used.\nFrom early on our efforts have focused on collecting\njourney data (as above) using a thermal imaging\ncamera and visualising the results in different formats\n(Figure 3). As the graphs show, current volumes are\nFigure 2. Illustrated image of Tenison Road by resident. Tenison Road is road running from top-middle of page (approx. North) to\nbottom-middle (approx. South).\nTaylor et al. 3\nindeed substantial and in aggregate the numbers appear\nto have been a surprise even to those residents who\nhave been actively involved in our meetings. What\nhas been arguably more enlightening, however, has\nbeen how different ideas for data sources have entered\ninto the conversations. The volume and speed of traffic\nare, by some, thought not to adequately reflect their\nworries. In one of our meetings a resident voiced a\ngreater concern for the noise on the street. He went\nso far as to say he did not especially care how many\nvehicles used the road or the speed at which they tra-\nvelled; he just did not want to hear them from inside\nTo capture traffic data, we have installed a thermal imaging camera to the roof of\nthe Microsoft Research building at the intersection of Tenison Road and Station\nRoad, in Cambridge (Figure 3(a)). Using heat readings, the camera is able to\ndisambiguate objects from a relatively temperature-uniform background (Figure 3(b)).\n)\nb\n(\n)\na\n(\nOur aim is to develop a range of ways for the data to be analysed and represented,\neach of which will afford different kinds of interpretations from different types\nof agents. For example, we are currently building a series of public installations\nthat will display information about speeds, traffic volumes, vehicle types, etc.\nFigure 3(c) shows one of these visualisation systems in which we are envisioning the\ndata driving remotely controlled, mechanical pie-charts and graphs, creating a\nspectacle for bystanders on the road to view the `data' they are themselves\nproducing, as well as ways for them to engage in and comment on it.\n(c)\nFigure 3. Traffic data collection and visualisation on Tenison Road.\n4 Big Data & Society\nhis house. Others have voiced a particular worry about\nair quality. It's evident that even on a single street, the\nways in which one data set might be interpreted, and\nthe actions it may seem to imply, vary greatly.\nWhat appears to be at stake in these conversations\nabout data then is the kind of environment the people\nof Tenison Road believe they live in, and the sort of\nplace they wish to live in. As one of the residents put it\nin an email correspondence with us:\n[W]e have a range of people from those who like to\nthink of themselves as living in a residential back\nstreet where traffic should not exist (even if they own\ntwo cars) and those who delight in living in a lively\ncosmopolitan city, albeit one of many commuters\naccording to the traffic data.\nWhat the residents we have worked with have agreed\non and appear to form some consensus around is an\naspiration for a better quality of life, one that encapsu-\nlates a sense of common (or communal) good. Data\nis \u00ad perhaps unsurprisingly given the nature of this\nproject \u00ad framed as a means to affect change and\nimprove things such as traffic. As one of the more vocif-\nerous residents in the community has phrased it, `the\npurpose of data is action', and this action is to enable `a\nbetter quality of life for the community'. Where some\nof this consensus is complicated, however, is in how\nexactly the data is understood with respect to collect-\nive action and a common good. A better quality of life\ncould mean a quieter street, a safer street, a street where\nthose living across the road are not cut off by a stream\nof traffic, or a street that is in the midst of a lively\ncosmopolitan city, with a busy railway station. And\neach of these necessitates quite different forms of\naction, collective or otherwise.\nTo situate the project within these different and, to\nsome extent, competing ideas of a common good, we\nhave initiated a traffic working-group made up of five\nresidents and one Microsoft staff member. As well as\nmaking decisions about what exactly to monitor and\nwhere, one of the aims of this group is to further\ninvolve the community in data collection by, for exam-\nple, inviting residents to `collect' noise and air quality\nreadings on their premises, data that will, in turn, be fed\ninto a community repository of traffic-related data. The\nhope is that a network of people may take shape `on the\nground' through sharing measuring equipment and a\ncollective involvement in data aggregation and analysis.\nThe point here is that, at least in the case of our\nproject, data come to be something that matters\nthrough the increasing set of relations that are enacted\nas that data is brought into being and put to use; the\nmattering is in the ever thickening relations between\npeople and data. The `circulation and flow' of data\nthat Beer and Borrows (2013) write of and their refer-\nence to MacKenzie's (2005) `performative circulations'\ndraw attention to this kind of recursive role data can\nhave with social life. And yet a fluid relationality of this\nsort raises further troubles for life on the street. We\nmight, for instance, speculate on the possibility of\nsomeone on Tenison Road opting out of the traffic\nmonitoring activities \u00ad they might see it as a privacy\ninfringement or, as some have, question the efficacy of\nthe exercise. Whatever the case, what would it look like\nto withdraw or withhold data here, where it is the\nincreasing density of manifold entanglements that give\nthe data significance for the community? The numbers\namassed using the thermal camera only begin to have\nany valence when they are sizeable enough and patterns\ncan be found in their aggregate \u00ad the data works\nbecause meaning is exercised through the undifferenti-\nated recognition of moving traffic; the patterns,\nrhythms, changes, etc. are projected in and through\nthe sheer volume of non-descript numbers.\nThe work involved in the removal of a person's data\nintervenes in this computational logic by giving pri-\nmacy to one particular set of figures rather than their\naggregates; it introduces the awkward need to identify a\nunique individual in the data for them then to be\nremoved. To be fair, such an intervention would not\n`break' the system \u00ad despite arguably aiming to achieve\nthe impossible \u00ad but it does disrupt how data analytics\nand computation are understood as efficacious because\nof their collective and impartial treatment of data.\nLikewise, we see such disruptions surfacing troubles\nelsewhere (because, as it has been argued, the compu-\ntational work is in no way at a different level to the\ncontext in which it is applied, but part of the same\nexpansive relational network; Latour et al., 2012).\nThat is, we find there is a disruption to the common\ngood associated with traffic monitoring. With someone\nopting-out of the data, questions must be asked about\nwhat constitutes `common' or `collective' in the case of\nTenison Road and how individual exceptions must be\naccounted for. As with the data and the computation, a\nlogic of coherence through undifferentiated treatment\nof each individual unravels what it means to assert col-\nlective action.\nTo draw this thread to a close, we want to briefly\nshow that the mattering of data is further complicated\nwhen it cuts across different relational assemblages.\nSomewhat sceptical of our traffic monitoring activities,\none resident has voiced questions about the commu-\nnity's role in producing data. She makes a distinction\nbetween data `coming from us' and `being done to us'.\nTroubled here are the separations between making data\nand putting this data to work for the good of the com-\nmunity. In this case, the concern shows how the data-\nmaking activities can be understood to be an equally\nTaylor et al. 5\nimportant factor in the hoped-for idea of community \u00ad\nthat for the data to have some value they must in effect\nbe an intended product of the community.\nAlso salient is the desire to produce data simply as a\nway of underpinning an understanding of the street in\nits current form, located at a point in time, in the con-\ntext of change. For example, as part of our collective\ndeliberations on traffic, one discussion developed into\nthe possibility of tracking how residents' movements\nand travel routines might change over the course of\nthe year, reflecting in some way the significant changes\nafoot in the built environment. To this end, two resi-\ndents have volunteered to wear location-tracking\ndevices and to feed their geo-temporal data into the\nlarger corpus of traffic data. In itself, this raises further\nquestions about the different qualities of individual\nversus collective data and how these qualities sit in\nterms of meaningful aggregation. However, here we\nwant to show what it might mean to read data and\nconsequently perform it in multiple ways.\nAn email received from a father and his two children\n(who have regularly attended the community meetings),\nresponding to the traffic monitoring activities and spe-\ncifically the location tracking (Figure 4), offers an indi-\ncation of how such data can be associated with different\naspects of the street and thus reframed as a record of\n`life' on the street. The email asks how the data might\nbe understood in terms of another activity we have\nbegun with Tenison Road, that is, building an archive\nthat represents a social history to the area.\nClearly, this message represents a sophistication in\nthinking. It refigures the location data in quite a differ-\nent sense of movement. The data is seen as constitutive\nof a `movement record' that locates the to-ings and fro-\nings on Tenison Road in wider trajectories of time and\nsocial life.\nIn this refiguring, we can imagine significantly differ-\nent ways in which the data is materialised. The efficacy\nof the data is not so clearly judged in terms of collective\naction and communal good, but rather in how a com-\nmunity hopes to learn about itself and represent itself,\nhistorically. Movement data, but also `the tools of\ntoday', become entangled in particular moments and\nthose moments are located in extended lines of chan-\nging human, machine and social relations. Opting in is\nless a shared conviction towards a common cause as it\nis marking a juncture of such relations. The data, the\ntools and the techniques are well and truly put back\ninto life on the street. As such, significant questions\nare raised about what Beer and Burrows (2013) have\ncharacterised as `by-product data'. They convincingly\nargue that the data coming out of online\ntransactions and other forms of digital life constitute\na by-product that is, in its own right, a highly prized\nand multifaceted commodity. We don't contest the\nimportance attributed to such by-product data, but\nseek to show that it is not so hard to find situations\nin which the modes of collection and aggregation come\nto matter as much as the data itself. Overemphasising\nthe by-product-ness of the data belies the value its\nmeans of production can have in social and (our spe-\ncific case) street life.\nStepping back, then, the Tenison Road project still\nfeels very much in its early stages (despite being five\nmonths in). As those who have conducted community\nfocused projects will attest, it takes a long time to build\ntrusting relationships, glean some sense of the issues at\nstake, and figure out how to participate in these. At this\nstage, what we're finding is how productive it has been\nto quite literally `go to the street' not only just to dis-\ncover how things are \u00ad how they are materialised and\nmatter for people \u00ad but also how they could be. We\nfind, even at the scale of the street, where the data we\nare dealing with is far from `big' (in any computational\nsense), data is folded into social life, and vice versa,\nso that what comes to matter takes shape in and\nthrough the myriad relations. Charts of data such as\nthose traffic graphs above are not in any way outside,\nbehind or below, but knitted into a road's community.\nIf anything, what's remarkable in our collective efforts\nthus far is how, without question, data has become\nordinary, how they have entangled in the efforts of a\n... I appreciate traffic is a major theme but we all think we don't want to\nend up being the city council traffic department. . Traffic is about people\nmoving and people moving in the wider aspect is hugely interesting- moving\nfor work, moving for school, moving for fun. we'd all be very up for\ntracking ourselves and seeing how our movement phenotypes differ.\nI think the ideas of archive and record are more interesting and\npotentially engaging in wider sphere and would be very interested how we\ncould use the tools of today to record life and movement. combining the\nmovement record within the sociological record might be able to make\ntraffic just that little more permanent than the more short term but ever\npresent gripes of urban traffic.\nFigure 4. Excerpt from email communication from resident.\n6 Big Data & Society\ncommunity to understand itself as such and decide\nwhat else it could be. That is not to say the data does\nnot raise problems in this collective going-on, however.\nIndeed, it does. By looking to see how the traffic data is\nmaterialised in measurements, graphs, partitions, dis-\nagreements, etc., we see how questions get raised\nabout its legitimacy and efficacy in both individual\nand civic participation. Furthermore, such material\ndata practices foreground tensions about how private,\npublic and civic lives are constituted. The materialising\nof data troubles how these categories are kept separate\nand, indeed, the reasons of keeping them apart.\nThe very specific ways in which data come to matter,\nthen, are at one and the same time part and parcel of\nhow the relations between a road and its residents \u00ad a\ncommunity \u00ad come into being.\nWe are also coming to see what it means to recognise\nour entanglements in those self-same troubles that our\nresearch efforts are giving shape to. Microsoft being on\nthe street (indeed, part of the looming development),\nand in some sense part of the community, has been\nsomething we have kept in the frame, as it were, to\nintentionally problematise the supposed rawness of\ndata and the imagined separation between the tech-\nniques of data collection and analysis and worldly mat-\nters. The traffic records of journeys made on Tenison\nRoad are recorded and analysed by us and re-distrib-\nuted through our own proprietary technological infra-\nstructures to residents and bystanders so they might\ntake some kind of collective action to improve the qual-\nity of life for a community. At the same time, Microsoft\nstands quite literally as a monolith in this neighbour-\nhood, provoking internal frictions within the commu-\nnity about what exactly constitutes `better'. Yet, it is\nprecisely these troubles enacted through this `collective\nand productively work through in the coming months.\nWe see these responsive and responsible forms of tech-\nnoscientific practice (Barad, 2007) as a means to genu-\ninely ask how data come to matter.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\nBarad KM (2007) Meeting The Universe Halfway: Quantum\nPhysics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning.\nDurham, NC: Duke University Press.\nBeer D and Burrows R (2013) Popular culture, digital arch-\nives and the new social life of data.
