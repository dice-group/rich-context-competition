    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The prevalence of HIV among U.S. inmates is much greater than in the general population, creating\npublic health concerns and cost issues for the criminal justice system. The HIV Services and Treatment Implementation\nin Corrections protocol of the NIDA funded Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies tested the efficacy of an\norganizational process improvement strategy on improving HIV services in correctional facilities.\nMethods: For this paper, we analyzed efficacy of this strategy on improving inmate awareness and perceptions of\nHIV services. The study used a multi-site (n = 28) clustered randomized trial approach. Facilities randomized to the\nexperimental condition used a coach-driven local change team approach to improve HIV services at their facility.\nFacilities in the control condition were given a directive to improve HIV services on their own. Surveys about awareness\nand perceptions of HIV services were administered anonymously to inmates who were incarcerated in study facilities\nat baseline (n = 1253) and follow-up (n = 1048). A series of one-way ANOVAs were run to test whether there were\ndifferences between inmates in the experimental and control facilities at baseline and follow-up.\nResults: Differences were observed at baseline, with the experimental group having significantly lower scores than the\ncontrol group on key variables. But, at post-test, following the intervention, these differences were no longer significant.\nConclusions: Taken in context of the findings from the main study, these results suggest that the change team\napproach to improving HIV services in correctional facilities is efficacious for improving inmates' awareness and\nperceptions of HIV services.\n",

In response, the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published\nguidelines to assist the criminal justice sector in the\nadoption of evidence-based practices to reduce inmate\nHIV risks and to provide HIV treatment in correctional\nsettings (CDC 2009). Based on these guidelines, O'Connell\net al. (2013) designed a continuum of care model for HIV\nservices in correctional settings that includes HIV testing,\nprevention and education, and linkage to treatment in the\nfacility as well as upon reentry to the community.\nAccording to the continuum of care model for HIV in\ncorrectional settings (O'Connell et al. 2013), all persons\nare tested for HIV at intake to a correctional facility un-\nless they specifically decline (i.e., opt-out testing). If the\nresult of the test is negative, additional intensive services\nare not necessary through most of that person's incarcer-\nation. If an inmate is known to be HIV-positive, or tests\npositive for HIV at intake, appropriate treatment, includ-\ning antiretroviral medication, begins immediately and\ncontinues through their incarceration. Prior to release\nand community reentry, all inmates regardless of HIV\nserostatus, receive an evidence-based HIV prevention\nintervention to encourage risk reduction during the\n* Correspondence: hswan@udel.edu\n1Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Edith\nNourse Rogers Memorial VA Hospital, 200 Springs Road (152), Bedford, MA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2015 Swan et al.

Examples of these may be found on the\nCenter for Disease Control's website (CDC Compendium\nof Effective Behavioral Interventions 2015) and/or on the\nNational Registry of Effective Practices and Programs\n(2015). These individuals also receive comprehensive dis-\ncharge planning to promote linkage to continued HIV care\nin the community to which they are returning. If all of\nthese services are implemented according to this model,\nthe evidence suggests that individual and public health out-\ncomes would improve for this population (see O'Connell\net al. 2013 for a thorough discussion of the evidence for\nthese practices).\nMany correctional facilities across the United States\nnow offer most (if not all) of the continuum of HIV ser-\nvices; in fact, studies have shown that HIV outcomes\n(i.e., viral load suppression and CD4 lymphocyte counts)\nfor incarcerated populations tend to improve during in-\n2004). However, research has also demonstrated the ex-\nistence of many gaps in services along the care continuum\nthat have resulted in insufficient HIV care, particularly\nduring the reentry transition back to the community\nImplementation science has evolved in health services\nresearch in response to such service gaps. The science has\nbeen important for identifying and understanding strat-\negies for expediting the application of best practices in\ndiverse populations and service sectors, as well as for\ndiverse health conditions (Brownson et al. 2012).\nIn response to the growing emphasis on implementation\nscience in health and the documented gaps in HIV ser-\nvices for correctional populations, the National Institute\non Drug Abuse (NIDA) sponsored the Criminal Justice\nDrug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS), a national col-\nlaborative of investigators on three protocols designed to\ntest implementation and process improvement strategies\nfor improving health services for the incarcerated popula-\ntion (Ducharme et al. 2013). This article presents data and\nanalyses from the HIV Services and Treatment in Correc-\ntional Settings protocol (HIV-STIC) which was developed\nto test an organizational process improvement strategy for\nimplementing and improving services along the HIV con-\ntinuum of care (i.e., prevention, testing, and linkage to\ntreatment) in correctional facilities in the United States\nInvestigators at each of nine research centers participat-\ning in HIV-STIC selected one or two pairs of correctional\nfacilities in which to implement the study. Paired facilities\nwere matched based on several factors including state/\nterritory and type of correctional facility (e.g., security\nlevel, prison or jail). One facility from each pair was ran-\ndomly assigned to either the experimental or the control\ncondition. Prior to randomization, selected staff from all\nlocal participating facilities engaged in a one-day train-\ning on evidence-based practices along the HIV care con-\ntinuum in correctional settings (for a total of 9 trainings\n- one per research center). At the end of the training, all\nstaff received a directive from an executive in their ad-\nministration to make improvements to services along\nthe HIV services continuum (i.e., prevention, testing, or\nlinkage). Staff in facilities randomized to the control con-\ndition received follow-up instructions from the executive\nto work on improving the services as they normally would.\nStaff in facilities randomized to the experimental condi-\ntion composed local change teams, facilitated by exter-\nnal coaching from individuals trained in the NIATx\nprocess improvement model (McCarty et al. 2007), to\nwork on improving HIV services. (See Belenko et al.\n2013b for a full description of the HIV-STIC protocol\ndesign).\nThe model of implementation research outcomes de-\nveloped by Proctor and colleagues' (2009) (see Figure 1)\nwas used to frame the design of the HIV-STIC study as\nwell as to guide the development of relevant outcome\nmeasures. The primary focus of the larger study was on\nimplementation outcomes at the staff or organizational\nlevel of analysis (e.g., feasibility, acceptability, penetra-\ntion) (see Figure 1). According to this model, achieving\nsuccess at the level of implementation outcomes should\ntrickle out to improvements in outcomes at the client\nlevel (e.g., satisfaction) in the absence of direct client\ninterventions. As such, this paper examines the distal\nclient outcomes of the HIV-STIC study, specifically\nwhether the process improvement intervention involving\nstaff was related to the awareness and perceptions of\nHIV services among their potential clients, that is, per-\nsons detained in the participating correctional facilities\nat the time of data collection. Our primary hypothesis is\nthat compared to the Control condition, inmates who\nare incarcerated in facilities in the Experimental condi-\ntion will express greater awareness of the HIV services\ncontinuum at follow-up. Our secondary hypothesis is\nthat compared to the Control condition, inmates' per-\nceptions of and attitudes towards HIV and the provision\nof HIV services in facilities in the Experimental condi-\ntion will be greater at follow-up.\nMethods/Design\nData collection and measures\nThe Anonymous Inmate Survey was administered by\nlocally trained research staff to groups of inmates, regard-\nless of HIV serostatus (i.e., HIV serostatus was unknown\nto researchers and inmates were not recruited based on\nHIV serostatus), who were incarcerated at the time of data\ncollection. Research staff worked with the correctional\nfacility staff to schedule at date and time to administer the\nsurveys. Facility staff then notified the inmates that they\ncould attend the group during that time to complete a\nsurvey as part of a research study, and organized the logis-\ntics for gathering the inmates in a group. There were no\ninclusion or exclusion criteria aside from being incarcer-\nated at the time of the survey administration and consent-\ning to participate. In the group setting, the research staff\ninformed the inmates that their participation was volun-\ntary, that they could choose which questions to complete\nand/or leave the study at any time, and that not participat-\ning or only partially participating would not affect them,\ntheir treatment, or their sentence, in any way. Inmates\nwere instructed that their answers on the survey were com-\npletely anonymous and told not to make any explicit identi-\nfying marks on the survey. Those who remained were told\nthat by doing so, they were consenting to participate in the\nstudy. These study procedures were approved by university\ninstitutional review boards (IRB) for the research centers in\nthe study and in many cases by an additional IRB with jur-\nisdiction over the correctional and other agencies that were\nthe research sites for the current study.\nWith the exception of two research centers, pretest\nsurveys were administered to a convenience sample of\ninmates incarcerated in the experimental and control\nstudy sites within one month of randomization (i.e., pre-\ntest). Due to logistical delays in initiating the study at\nparticipating sites, staff at two research centers adminis-\ntered the surveys at 4 and 8 months after randomization,\nrespectively. In both cases, surveys were administered\nprior to implementing the change teams. Posttest sur-\nveys were administered to another convenience sample\nof inmates incarcerated in the experimental and control\nstudy sites between two and six months after completion\nof the implementation phase of the study.\nThe inmate survey included 21 items focused on eli-\nciting yes/no and Likert scale responses from each\nparticipant. A final question asked whether they would\nlike to make any additional comments or observations,\nand if so, to write them in the space provided. (An add-\nitional file provides a copy of the questions asked on the\nsurvey [see Additional file 1]). To test the first hypoth-\nesis, we created an HIV services awareness index (range\n0\u00ad4) by summing the responses to the four questions in-\nquiring about participants' awareness of the availability of\nany of the HIV care continuum services (i.e., HIV educa-\ntion and prevention, HIV testing, HIV medication, and\npre-release planning services for HIV infected inmates) in\nthe correctional facility where they were incarcerated at\nthe time of survey administration.\nTo test our second hypothesis, we used three compos-\nite scales that were identified through principal axis fac-\ntor analysis of twelve items asking inmates to rate the\nease of using as well as how they felt about each of the\nHIV care continuum service components at their facility\nusing a five point Likert scale (1\u00ad5). Staff Impact mea-\nsured inmate perceptions of the medical, treatment, and\ncorrectional staffs' support for HIV continuum of care on\nfour items like \"the medical staff at this institution does a\ngood job of supporting HIV services and this institution is\ndoing everything it can to stop the spread of HIV\". The\nsecond scale, Medication/Pre-release Planning, included\ntwo items: \"how much [do] you believe inmates who have\nHIV could benefit from receiving HIV medication while\nincarcerated\" and \"how much [do] you believe inmates\nwho have HIV could benefit from receiving pre-release\nplanning services\". The final scale, HIV Education and\nPrevention/HIV Testing, was composed of four items re-\nlated to perceptions towards these services, such as \"how\ndo you feel about HIV education and prevention classes in\nthis institution\" and \"how easy would it be for you to get\ntested for HIV at this institution\". The internal consistency\nreliability for the three scales ranged from good ( = .90)\nFigure 1 Model of Implementation Science Outcomes (Modified from Proctor et al. 2009).\nto adequate ( = .68). Because we are unaware of any other\nsurveys of inmate awareness and perceptions of the HIV\nServices continuum, we conducted psychometric analyses,\nthe results of which are available from the corresponding\nauthor of this study.\nAnother summative composite (range 0\u00ad3) reflected\nwhether the inmate would consider accessing HIV edu-\ncation and prevention and/or HIV testing. A final item\nasked them to rate their current level of concern about\ngetting infected with HIV with responses ranging from 1\n(Not at all) to 5 (Very Concerned).\nAnalytic plan\nBecause it was unknown whether the surveys were com-\npleted by different inmates at each time point (due to the\nanonymity of respondents), a within-subjects analysis such\nas repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\ncould not be calculated with confidence. Instead, a\nseries of one-way ANOVAs were first conducted to\ncompare the experimental and control conditions on\npretest measures of awareness, perceptions, willingness\nto be tested for HIV or to attend HIV prevention and\neducation, and concern about becoming infected. A sec-\nond set of one-way ANOVAs compared the experimen-\ntal and control groups on posttest measures of the same\nset of variables. Cohen's d statistic was used to calculate\neffect size, with .2 generally considered a small effect\nsize, .5 a medium effect size, and .8 a large effect size.\nSample\nSeven of the nine HIV-STIC research centers collected\nmates for the pre-intervention and 1048 post-intervention\nsurveys. Two research centers did not administer the An-\nonymous Inmate Survey due to logistical issues in obtain-\ning permission from either the IRB or the correctional\nfacility administrators to survey the inmates. One research\ncenter did not collect the post-intervention inmate survey\ndue to logistical issues in obtaining permission from the\ncorrectional facility to survey the inmates. On average,\neach research site contributed an average of 52 (range\nposttest surveys. The percentages of surveys contributed\nby each research center are presented in Table 1.\nAs shown in Table 1, demographically, 11 percent of\nthe inmates were incarcerated in women's facilities.\nMore than two-thirds (66.9%) of the inmates were in-\ncarcerated in a prison and about half (55.3%) were in\ncorrectional programs assigned to the experimental\nstudy condition. Four of the institutions housed only\nSpanish-speaking inmates. The Anonymous Inmate\nSurvey was translated into Spanish for these sites. The\nprevalence of HIV in the state's correctional system\nwas taken from the Bureau of Justice Statistics report\nsummarizing HIV/AIDS prevalence in state correctional\nstate prevalence estimates were from taken the website of\nNational Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and\nTB Prevention of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)\n(2015). Reflecting both the prevalence of HIV in correc-\ntional facilities as well as the CDC rank of the HIV preva-\nlence in the states, thirty-eight percent of surveys were\ncollected in \"high prevalence\" areas.\nResults\nPretest and posttest comparisons\nOne-way ANOVAs on pre-intervention (pretest) aware-\nness and perceptions of HIV services showed that in-\nmates who were incarcerated in control facilities scored\nsignificantly higher on the HIV services awareness index,\nCohen's d = .30], and on their impressions of staff impact\nCohen's d = .20], than inmates in facilities in the\nTable 1 Characteristics of anonymous inmate survey\nCharacteristic Survey administration % of total N\n% of total\nN at pretest\n% of total\nN at posttest\nResearch site\nSex\nFacility type\nState HIV prevalence\ncategory\nStudy condition\n1Research Center `C' did not collect the post-intervention inmate survey due to\nlogistical issues in obtaining permission from the correctional facility to survey\nthe inmates.\nexperimental condition. Conversely, the experimental\ngroup had significantly higher scores on the index of\nwhether they would consider using HIV prevention and\ntesting services, though the effect size was small [F(1,\ngroups were not significantly different on the other\ndependent variables at pretest.\nOne-way ANOVAs on post-intervention (posttest)\nawareness and perceptions of HIV services showed only\none statistically significant difference: the inmates who\nwere incarcerated in experimental facilities were signifi-\ncantly more concerned about contracting HIV, though\nthe effect size for this difference was small [F(1, 1032) =\nwere statistically significant.a\nDiscussion\nThe comparison of the one-way ANOVA findings for\npretest and posttest awareness of HIV services revealed\nthat the differences observed on the pretest (i.e., the\ncontrol group showed a greater awareness of HIV services\nand more positive evaluations of staff impact; the experi-\nmental group reported being more likely to consider using\nHIV services) did not exist at posttest. Although these\nfindings do not reflect a direct change since the groups of\ninmates who were surveyed at posttest likely were not the\nsame inmates who filled out the surveys at pretest, they\ndo suggest that the change team intervention helped close\nthe significant gaps identified between experimental and\ncontrol groups on these key variables. Specifically, the\nawareness of HIV services was higher in the experimental\ncondition at posttest than it was a pretest, and the aware-\nness was no longer significantly lower than the control\ngroup, thus providing some support for our first hypoth-\nesis. The same holds true for the findings on staff impact,\nlending some support for our second hypothesis.\nCollectively, these findings suggest facilities at least an\nindirect effect of the change team intervention on\nimprovement in HIV services along the care continuum\nsince inmates in the experimental condition at posttest\n\"closed-the-gap\" on differences observed on pretest\nawareness and perceptions of staff impact, with differ-\nences on these scores no longer significant at posttest.\nFinally, concern about becoming infected with HIV\namong inmates incarcerated in facilities in the experi-\nmental facilities at posttest was significantly higher than\namong inmates in the control facilities, which also sug-\ngests a distal effect of the HIV-STIC intervention to im-\nprove the continuum of HIV services.\nAlthough these results only lend indirect support for\nthe effectiveness of the local change team model, they\nshould be interpreted within the context of the larger\nHIV-STIC study findings and per the model of imple-\nmentation outcomes that framed this study and analysis\n(see Figure 1). Pearson and colleagues (2014) report the\nfinding from the larger study that the local change team\napproach significantly improved the actual delivery of\nHIV services to incarcerated individuals. Our finding\nthat the distance between the baseline differences in\ncontrol and experimental samples in inmate awareness\nof HIV services is consistent with this implementation\noutcome of the larger study. The gap between the control\nand experimental groups' perceptions of staff impact at\nbaseline also narrows in the current analysis. This finding\nsupports another main study outcome, published by\nVisher et al. (2014), which showed improvements in staff\nperception of the feasibility and acceptability of HIV ser-\nvices as a result of the local change team process.\nLimitations\nIn spite of the study's large multi-site sample and its\nfocus on an understudied area of HIV services research,\nseveral limitations must be considered when interpreting\nthese findings. First, sample design was not random and\nthe results may not be generalizable to the population in\nprison at the time of each data collection period. Second,\nTable 2 Comparison of dependent variable means by study condition at pre- and post-test\nPretest Posttest\nDependent variables Experimental group Control group p Experimental group Control group p\nConsider going to HIV Education or getting\ntested for HIV\nNote. The mean values of groups on dependent variables are presented in the columns, with the standard deviations appearing in the parentheses immediately\nbelow the corresponding mean. Bonferroni adjustment to correct for an inflated Type 1 error rate (i.e., .05\u00f712 comparisons) yielded a significance level of p = .004.\nTherefore, interpretation of mean differences with associated significance levels above this are at a significantly increased risk for Type 1 error.\nHIV serostatus or risk for infection of those who chose\nto participate was unknown and it is possible that in-\nmates with a greater concern about the need for HIV\nservices were more likely to answer the study questions.\nWe were also unable to assess study respondents longi-\ntudinally. The anonymous survey precluded identifying\nthe respondent at baseline to enable administering the\npost-test measure. Future implementation research stud-\nies should explore whether these distal outcomes are\nreplicated using repeated measures in representative\nsamples of the population. Studies should also explore\nfactors that could modify these findings, such as whether\nthe facilities housed males or females and whether the\nfacility was a jail or prison, analysis that could not be\nundertaken in this study due to sample size limitations.\nAnother limitation in the current study was response\nfactors that were beyond the control of the researchers\nin terms of survey administration at sites. Two of the re-\nsearch centers with correctional facilities in the study\ndid not administer the anonymous inmate survey ques-\ntionnaire to inmates in their facility at baseline or\nfollow-up, and an additional research center adminis-\ntered it at baseline only, due to resistance from the In-\nstitutional Review Board (IRB) or the correctional\nfacilities administration.\nConclusion\nComparisons between experimental and control condi-\ntions on two independent survey administrations of\nitems related to perceptions of HIV care continuum ser-\nvices showed that inmates in the two conditions were\ninitially different on three variables: 1) number of HIV\nservices they were aware of, 2) perceptions of staff im-\npact, and 3) willingness to seek HIV prevention and edu-\ncation or testing services. However, at posttest, only one\nsignificant difference was observed: the experimental\ngroup reported significantly higher levels of concern\nabout contracting HIV. Collectively, these findings sug-\ngest at least an indirect effect of the change team inter-\nvention on improvement in HIV services along the care\ncontinuum since inmates in the experimental condition\nat posttest \"closed-the-gap\" on differences observed on\npretest awareness and perceptions of staff impact, with\ndifferences on these scores no longer significant at post-\ntest. While we must be careful not to over-state the\ncausal effect of improvement of HIV services through\nthis model, the current findings interpreted in the con-\ntext of the larger study findings lend support for effect-\niveness of the local change team model on the actual\nprovision of HIV services, improved inmate awareness of\nHIV services while incarcerated, and improvements in\nstaff and inmate attitudes towards HIV services in cor-\nrectional settings.\nEndnote\naThe Bonferroni procedure for correcting for type 1\nerror inflation indicated an adjusted alpha level of .004\nshould be used.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: HIV Work Group Anonymous Inmate Survey.\nCompeting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nAuthors' contributions\nAll authors were involved in data collection and analysis for the main HIV-STIC\nstudy.
