To date, little is known with regard to\nthe trends and characteristics of NIH-funded trials.\nPrior to registration, the task of describing such charac-\nteristics was not possible because information had to\nbe based on data from published trials, a biased subset.\n1Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of\nPublic Health, Baltimore, MD, USA\n2Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Johns\nHopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA\nCorresponding author:\nGillian K Gresham, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins\nBloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N. Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD\nEmail: ggresha3@jhu.edu\nWith clinical trial registration, we now have access to\ninformation on clinical trials, whether or not\npublished.1\nThe notion of registering trials emerged in the 1980s\nprimarily because of concerns regarding publication\nbias: the tendency for authors and editors to publish\nresults supporting conclusions favoring a particular\nhypothesis or position.2\u00ad5 Calls for registration eventu-\nally led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\nin the Modernization Act of 1997, to require the estab-\nlishment of a system of registration pertaining to trials\nof agents regulated by the FDA. The Act gave rise to\nClinicalTrials.gov, operated by the National Library\nof Medicine of the NIH. Since its launch in 2000,\nTrials.gov, and it is anticipated that more trials will be\nregistered in coming years, due to changes in registra-\ntion requirements. First, in 2005, the International\nCommittee of Medical Journal Editors announced that\npublication would be conditional upon trial registra-\ntion prior to initiation of enrollment.6 Subsequently,\nthe Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act\nments and the types of trials to be registered, as well as\nincreasing the number of data elements to be reported.\nMost recently, the release of the Final Rule for\nand expanded statutory requirements for trial report-\ning.7 The NIH issued an additional policy that\nrequires all NIH-funded trials to be registered, regard-\nless of whether they are covered under FDAAA 801\nrequirements.7\nGiven the recent updates in NIH trial reporting\nrequirements, more information regarding the current\nstate of NIH-funded clinical trials is warranted. While\nthere have been other reports that have summarized\ncharacteristics of clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov,\nthere have not been any reviews that focus solely on\nNIH-funded trials and evaluate differences over time\nand across Institutes and Centers. Thus, the objective\nwas to describe the characteristics and trends of clinical\ntrials funded by the NIH, summarized by year and by\nInstitutes and Centers.\nMethods\nClinical trials data source\nData from NIH-funded clinical trials registered in\nlyzed. Counts and summary statistics were generated\nusing data downloaded from the Clinical Trials\nTransformation Initiative Aggregate Analysis of\nClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) database.\nThe AACT database is a restructured database of\nthe ClinicalTrials.gov data that provides exports of the\nrelational database as either Oracle data management\nplatform, pipe delimited text output, or SAS CPort\ntransport files.8 The AACT database is updated every\n6 months and includes all clinical trials registered in\nClinicalTrials.gov to that date. Analyses were done\nat: http://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/.8 The National\nClinical Trials identification number was used to link\ntables and merge the AACT dataset with an export of\nthe ClinicalTrials.gov dataset. Identification numbers\nare assigned through ClinicalTrials.gov upon registra-\ntion and are included in both databases as the key iden-\ntifier. Navigation through the AACT database was\naccomplished using the AACT comprehensive data dic-\ntionary (http://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/what-we-do/\nanalysis-dissemination/state-clinical-trials/aact-\ndatabase).\nData analysis\nWe performed a descriptive analysis of clinical trials\nClinicalTrials.gov database. In most tables, we present\ndata by year (Panel A) and by NIH Institutes and\nCenters (Panel B). The analysis is limited to interven-\ntional studies (clinical trials), as defined in\nClinicalTrials.gov.9 The analysis was also limited to\nNIH-funded trials identified from the ``agency_class''\nvariable in the ``sponsors'' table of the AACT database.\nThere were 31 different Institutes and Centers included\nin the analysis listed under the ``agency'' variable and\nindicated as either ``lead sponsors'' or ``collaborators.''\nAny trial in which an NIH Institute or Center was\nlisted as ``sponsor'' (``The organization or person who\noversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyz-\ning the study data'') or ``collaborator'' (``An organiza-\ntion other than the sponsor that provides support for a\nclinical study. The support may include funding,\ndesign, implementation, data analysis, or reporting'')\nwas included in the analysis.9\nSome trials were listed as being funded by two or\nmore NIH Institutes or Centers. Trial identification\nnumbers are counted only once in tabulations repre-\nsented in the A panels of tables and counted for each\nfunding Institute or Center in the B panels of tables.\nFor example, a trial registered in 2007, and funded by\nthree different institutes, would be counted only once\nfor the year 2007 in Panel A and counted once for each\nfunding Institute or Center associated with this particu-\nlar trial in Panel B. In Panel B, NIH Institutes and\nCenters were categorized by number of trials registered\nlisted in Supplementary Table 1. Some trials were listed\nas ``NIH'' without any Institute or Center designation\nand referred to as ``NIH-Not Otherwise Specified.''\nThere were seven individual sponsor names listed under\n``agencies'' in the AACT database that were excluded\nfrom the analysis as they did not belong to any specific\nNIH institution or center.\nCharacteristics of interest included age and sex dis-\ntributions, study design, trial phases, and enrollment\nsizes. Sex and age groups were summarized using vari-\nables in the AACT ``clinicalstudy_noclob'' table. Sex\ngroups were summarized as ``male only''; ``female\nonly''; and ``both male and female.'' Age groups were\ncategorized as ``child only''; ``adult only''; ``adult and\nsenior,'' or other. Details of the study designs were\nextracted from the allocation variable in the ``designs''\ntable and from the ``study_design'' variable in the\nClinicalTrials.gov database. A trial was counted as ran-\ndomized if the variable was recorded as ``random'' and\ncounted as not randomized if the variable was recorded\nas ``nonrandom'' or left blank. To determine the pro-\nportion of multicenter trials, trials with more than one\nsite were considered ``multicenter,'' and trials with one\nsite or left blank were counted as single-center. Clinical\ntrial phases were defined and described using the\nClinicalTrials.gov definitions.9\nSample size was determined from the ``enrollment''\nvariable labeled as either ``anticipated'' or ``actual.'' For\ntrials still enrolling, registrants were to set the\n``Enrollment_Type'' variable to ``anticipated'' to indi-\ncate ``expected enrollment.'' When enrollment was com-\npleted, the ``Enrollment_Type'' variable was set to\n``actual'' and the finished sample size recorded.\nTabulations were replicated independently by two\nauthors (G.K.G. and J.L.M.). Discrepancies were dis-\ncussed and resolved.\nResults\nas interventional studies (clinical trials). After limiting\nincluded. After limiting to trials funded by ``NIH'' and\ncontrolling for multiple counts of trials funded by more\nthan one Institute or Center (n = 1,015), a total of\n12,987 unique trials were included and sorted by year in\nPanel A.

Phase 3 and phase 4 trials make up\nabout 11% and 5% of the trial portfolio over the last\n10 years. A third of NIH-funded trials were classified as\n``Other'' phase or ``Phase not specified.'' ``Other'' trials\nrefer to trials that do not fit the definition of phases.\nOver time, there has been a decline in the percentage of\nphase 3 or 4 trials and an increase in ``other'' trials\n(Table 1, Panel A).\nmore clinical trials registered (.95% of all trials regis-\ntered). The number of trials declined over time for\nInstitutes and Centers with 100 or more trials regis-\ntered, although stayed constant for Institutes and\nCenters with less than 100 trials registered\n(Supplementary Figure 1). The National Cancer\nInstitute has the most trials (n = 4,986), while the\nOffice of Rare Diseases has the least (n = 10).\nNational Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research,\npart of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute\nof Child Health and Human Development, and\nTherapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases, part of\nthe National Center for Advancing Translational\nScience, each registered three trials. There were 1,047\ntrials funded by ``NIH-Not Otherwise Specified'' that\nwere excluded from counts in Panel B.\nThe NIH Institutes and Centers vary widely in distri-\nbution of trials by phase (Table 1, Panel B). For\nFigure 1.

The majority of ``other'' trials were ``beha-\nvioral'' or ``dietary'' trials (55%). Some were classified\nas ``device'' trials (6%).\nThe composition of trials by age and sex over time\nand by NIH Institute or Center is shown in Table 2.\nThe distribution of age and sex has been constant over\ntime (Table 2, Panel A). The majority of trials include\nboth females and males (85%). Female-only trials\n(11%) outnumber male-only (4%) trials about three to\none. The majority of trials (93%) included combina-\ntions of adults only, seniors only, or other age combi-\nnations, while the remainder of trials (7%) included\nchildren only.\nThe percentages of trials that are multicenter and ran-\ndomized have remained unchanged over time: 33% mul-\nticenter and 61% randomized (Supplementary Table 2).\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases has the most multicenter trials (50%) and the\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative\nHealth the least (16%).

Over the last decade, the NIH has funded\nClinicalTrials.gov. Registration allowed us to identify\nand characterize these trials.\nFindings from our analysis suggest that there has\nbeen a decline in NIH-funded trials since 2005, as regis-\ntered in ClinicalTrials.gov. This finding is consistent\nwith results from other studies.10\u00ad12 The decline could\nbe explained by a flat NIH budget, remaining constant\nTable 3.

Increasing trial\ncosts have been observed in industry-funded trials over\ntime and have also been identified as barriers to\ngovernment-funded trials.15 In this report, the esti-\nmated average cost of a phase 1 trial has been reported\nHowever, the authors point out that it is difficult to\nobtain accurate cost estimates, and the estimates they\nprovided are not adjusted for inflation.\nThere is considerable variation in the number of\ntrials funded by the different NIH Institutes and\nCenters. This may be explained in part by the different\nmissions of each Institute or Center in addition to the\nduration of time since they were established. However,\nwhile some Institutes and Centers, for example,\nNational Library of Medicine, are not necessarily\nexpected to fund trials, others, for example, National\nInstitute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, have a\nclinical content area and mission but fund few trials.\nOne might hope that the decline in NIH-funded trials\nwould have been offset by trials with larger sample sizes,\nbut there is no evidence this is so. The majority of NIH-\nfunded clinical trials are small with median sample sizes\nthat the median sample sizes of phase 4 trials were smaller\nthan those of phase 3 trials. These numbers did not change\nwhen including the sample sizes for only completed trials\nor evaluating them separately by year of registration. This\nmight be due to the small number of phase 4 trials that\nare funded by the NIH. These are conducted after a drug\nhas been approved by the FDA for marketing.\nTable 4.

These\nnumbers may be even smaller than shown, as we\nincluded ``anticipated'' enrollment in the calculations\nand ``anticipated'' often falls short of ``actual.'' The\nproportion of large trials (.500 participants) is small\nand has not changed over time. Approximately 10%\nof the source of funding.11 Overall, these findings raise\nthe question about whether NIH-funded trials are pow-\nered to produce meaningful differences, especially for\nOur findings suggest that most trials funded by the\nNIH are early- and middle-stage trials. Only 16% of\nNIH-funded trials are phase 3\u00ad4 studies, and the num-\nbers have decreased over time.\nThere is variation in the distribution of trials by\nphase across the different Institutes and Centers. For\ninstance, the National Eye Institute funded the highest\nproportion of phase 3\u00ad4 studies, while the National\nCancer Institute funded the lowest. Trials funded by\nthe National Cancer Institute were mostly early-phase\ntrials, of which only a third were randomized. The gen-\nder and age composition has remained stable. Our\nresults suggest that female-only trials have consistently\noutnumbered male-only trials over time, possibly as a\nThere has been a notable increase in the number of\n``other'' trials being funded by the NIH, possibly\nexplained by a shift in the clinical trial landscape and\nfocus on a larger number of non-therapeutic trials. An\nexpansion of the ClinicalTrials.gov registration fields\nfor the ``Other trials'' would be a useful change in order\nto better capture and classify ``other'' trials. Currently,\nit is difficult to understand the types of trials classified\nas ``other.''\nThe number of multicenter and randomized trials is\nsmall and has remained constant over time. The need\nfor large clinical trials to answer important clinical and\nhealth policy questions has been previously noted, as\nhas the lack of support and resources from major fun-\nders of clinical research.22 The NIH mission is to ``seek\nfundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior\nof living systems and the application of that knowledge\nto enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and\ndisability.''23 While the majority of NIH-funded trials\nare early-development trials, as shown in our analysis,\nsupporting the first part of the stated mission, there is a\nneed for more large, randomized trials to support the\nlatter part of this mission.\nThere are limitations associated with using and ana-\nlyzing data from ClinicalTrials.gov. Tracking the state\nof NIH-funded trials via information contained in\nClinicalTrials.gov is predicated on the assumption that\ntrials are registered.24 NIH project officers work to\nensure registration and, increasingly, NIH Institutes\nand Centers do not release funds until trials are regis-\ntered. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the number\nof NIH-funded trials not registered is small. The release\nof the Final rule in September 2016 will likely improve\nthe reporting of NIH-funded trials in ClinicalTrials.gov\nAnother limitation is the potential for incomplete\ndata or misclassification of funding source. Funding\nsource is derived from how registrants complete the\n``sponsor'' and ``collaborator'' fields when registering.\nIf NIH is mentioned in either field, the trial is identified\nas NIH-funded. Otherwise, the trial is not identified as\nbeing NIH-funded, even if in fact it is. To remove con-\nfusion surrounding funding type in ClinicalTrials.gov,\nregistrants should be explicitly asked to indicate fund-\ning source, independent of the collaborator, sponsor,\nor grant number.\nIt is difficult to estimate the extent of under reporting\nof NIH as a funding source. To explore this issue, two\nindependent reviewers compared NIH-funded trials\nin ClinicalTrials.gov to trials listed in the NIH\nRePORTER.14 There was a small proportion of trials\n(;10%), which varied by NIH Institutes and Trials, that\nwere listed in RePORTER and not indicated as NIH-\nfunded in ClinicalTrials.gov. To investigate further, we\nused the secondary identifiers from ClinicalTrials.gov,\nadded in 2009, to identify NIH-funded trials by grant\nnumbers. Numbers from this search were slightly higher\nthan those derived from the ``funder_type'' variable.\nHowever, cleaning and sorting grant numbers to cor-\nrectly categorize them is a cumbersome task.\nFurthermore, it is not guaranteed that grant numbers are\nentered accurately or completely. While study counts\nvaried slightly across the different sources, the reported\ntrends and conclusions remained unchanged.\nIn conclusion, there has been a decline in the num-\nber of registered NIH-funded trials since 2005. Most\nNIH-funded trials are small and single-centered, with a\nlarge fraction that are non-randomized. Substantial dif-\nferences exist in the number and types of trials done by\nInstitutes and Centers within the NIH. Limitations\nassociated with the accuracy and completeness of regis-\ntration data among other registration variables were\nuncovered in this analysis, as these have to be inferred.\nHowever, while the registration system is imperfect, it\nis an important step forward toward accountability of\nfunders, sponsors, and trialists.\n"
