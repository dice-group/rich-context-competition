    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: To determine whether haemoperfusion (HP) with continuous venovenous haemofil-\ntration (CVVH) improves the survival of patients with acute paraquat poisoning, compared with\nthose treated using HP alone.\nMethods: Medical records of patients with acute paraquat poisoning were analysed. Patients were\nrandomised to undergo HP or HP \u00fe CVVH within 24 h of paraquat ingestion. Mortality rate,\nsurvival duration and cause of death were recorded.\nResults: There were no significant differences in mortality rate between the HP group (n \u00bc 458)\nand the HP \u00fe CVVH group (n \u00bc 226) (57.4% and 58.4%, respectively). The mean survival duration\nwas significantly longer in the HP \u00fe CVVH group than the HP group (8.6 \u00c6 3.1 and 5.1 \u00c6 2.3 days,\nrespectively). Early circulatory collapse was a major cause of death in the HP group. The major\ncause of death in the HP \u00fe CVVH group was late respiratory failure.\nConclusion: Combined therapy with HP and CVVH can prevent early death and prolong survival\nduration following acute paraquat poisoning, providing the opportunity for further treatment.\n",

HP is most effective when\ninitiated within 2 h of paraquat injection\nand 4 h of ingestion and administered con-\nvalue in cases of severe paraquat poisoning,\nhowever.13,14 Repeated pulses of immuno-\nsuppression with methylprednisolone and\ncyclophosphamide may lower mortality\nrates,5 although a multicentre study found\nthat mortality rates remained high in spite of\nlarge intercentre variations in treatment\n(including HP, immunosuppression and\nantioxidant treatment).4 Continuous renal\nreplacement therapy, such as continuous\nvenovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), is\nused to treat patients with acute renal failure\nand cardiovascular instability and is\nbelieved to eliminate excess cytokines and\ninhibit abnormal enzyme release.15 To the\nbest of our knowledge, there have been no\nlarge-scale studies investigating the efficacy\nof HP with CVVH in lowering the mortality\nrate of paraquat poisoning.\nThe aim of this retrospective study was to\ndetermine whether HP with CVVH\nimproves the survival of patients with\nacute paraquat poisoning, compared with\nthose treated using HP alone.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective study recruited patients\nwith acute paraquat poisoning admitted to\nThe First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou\nUniversity, Zhengzhou, Henan, China\nExclusion criteria were: (i) patient held\nparaquat in their mouth, but did not swal-\nlow; (ii) time to arrival at emergency room\n>24 h; (iii) refusal to participate; (iv) incom-\nplete treatment. Paraquat poisoning was\nclassified via sodium dithionite test of urine\nobtained on arrival at the emergency room:\ndark blue, severe poisoning; blue to light\nblue, mild-to-moderate poisoning; no blue\ncolour, negative.16 Acute kidney injury was\ndiagnosed according to the RIFLE classifi-\ncation (class R, class I, or class F).17\nThe study was granted an exemption in\nwriting by the Ethics Review Board of the\nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou\nUniversity and the requirement for specific\ninformed consent was waived. Informed\nconsent regarding the risk of acute paraquat\npoisoning and all treatment modalities was\nobtained from all patients upon their initial\nadmission. All patient information was\nsecurely protected and available only to the\ninvestigators.\nTreatment\nOn admission, vital signs were assessed and\nroutine lab tests (including complete blood\ncell counts, liver and renal function, coagu-\nlation function, arterial blood gas and rou-\ntine urine analysis) were performed. All\npatients received a unified therapeutic regi-\nmen including gastric lavage, fluid replace-\nment, antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin B\nand L-glutathione) and immunosuppres-\nsants (corticosteroids). To reduce the\nextent of oxygen free radical-induced organ\ninjury, intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg\nevery 6 h for 3 days) and intravenous\nvitamin C (3 g/day for 5\u00ad7 days) were\nadministered to all patients.\nUsing the block randomization method,\npatients were randomly assigned to undergo\nHP or HP \u00fe CVVH. HP comprised one or\ntwo courses of 300 g charcoal HP therapy\nfor 6 h (Adsorba; Gambro, Sweden) using\nan jugular dual-lumen catheter. CVVH was\nperformed immediately after HP using an\nAK-10 blood pump with polyamide haemo-\nfilter (FH-55; Gambro, Stockholm,\n2000 ml/h. Duration of CVVH, replacement\nfluid and net ultrafiltration rates varied\naccording to clinical status. Bicarbonate-\nbased solutions were administered before\nthe haemofilter as replacement solutions,\nand haemofilters were changed every\npermeability and loss of ultrafiltration\ncapacity. Heparin infusion was continued\nthromboplastin time at 50% greater than\nnormal.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n (%).\nBetween-group comparisons were made\nusing 2-test or Mann\u00adWhitney test, as\nappropriate.

There were no\nsignificant between-group differences in\nprognostic factors or mortality rate. The\ntime from paraquat ingestion to death was\nsignificantly longer and significantly fewer\npatients died within 4 days in the\nHP \u00fe CVVH group than the HP group\n(P < 0.01 for each comparison; Table 1).\nThere was a significant between-group dif-\nference in cause of death, with circulatory\ncollapse the major cause of death in the HP\ngroup and respiratory failure the major\ncause of death in the HP-CVVH group\nDiscussion\nParaquat is a widely used herbicide that has\nhospital fatality rate of paraquat poisoning\nis approximately 55%, with no significant\ndifferences between survivors and non-sur-\nvivors with respect to patient characteristics.\nDeath generally occurs 24\u00ad72 h after inges-\ntion, with causes including acute respiratory\nfailure, acute renal failure, acute hepatic\nfailure and multiple organ dysfunction syn-\ndrome.1,18 The present study found that,\ncompared with HP alone, HP \u00fe CVVH\nincreases survival time but does not improve\nthe mortality rate of patients with acute\nparaquat poisoning.\nContinuous venovenous haemofiltration\nhas been shown to stabilize the haemo-\ndynamic status of patients with severe\nsepsis and multiorgan failure, but the exact\nmechanisms underlying its beneficial effects\nremain unclear.19 It is possible that CVVH\nmay be effective in eliminating serum cyto-\nkines and enzymes,19 and could therefore\nbenefit patients with acute paraquat\n28 Journal of International Medical Research 43(1)\npoisoning. Significantly more patients in the\nHP-CVVH group than the HP group sur-\nvived for longer than 4 days in the present\nstudy, and many of these patients died from\nrespiratory failure. This suggests that\nprophylactic CVVH after HP can reduce\nthe number of early deaths caused by multi-\norgan failure but does not prevent late\npulmonary fibrosis. The extended survival\ntime afforded by CVVH may provide the\nopportunity for further treatment.\nSeveral small-scale studies have shown\nthat prophylactic CVVH after HP could\nprolong survival time and prevent early\ndeath caused by circulatory collapse, but\ncannot provide a survival benefit in acute\nparaquat poisoning.20,21 The present study\nincluded a large cohort of patients who were\ntreated according to a uniform three-step\nprotocol: (i) Fuller's earth within 24 h\nfollowing paraquat ingestion to reduce\nabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract;\n(ii) intensive extracorporeal elimination\ntherapy (HP and CVVH) if urine paraquat\ntest was positive; (iii) intensive antioxidant\ntherapy (N-acetylcysteine, glutathione,\nvitamin C). HP is known to effectively\neliminate paraquat from the blood, in spite\nof its limited effects on mortality.22,23 This\nmay be due to the fact that the ingested\nquantity is commonly many times greater\nthan the lethal dose, and the long delay\nbetween ingestion and presentation.\nThis study has several limitations, most\nnotably the absence of data regarding\nplasma paraquat concentrations. Plasma\nparaquat levels peak early in the course of\npoisoning, then decrease rapidly during the\nFigure 1.

An error of 1\u00ad2 h in the\nestimate of ingestion time can move a\ncurve.24 In addition, plasma paraquat levels\ncannot be checked easily and quickly in an\nemergency situation. In addition, the present\nstudy was retrospective and performed in a\nsingle centre.\nIn conclusion, combined therapy with HP\nand CVVH can prevent early death and\nprolong survival duration following acute\nparaquat poisoning, providing the oppor-\ntunity for further treatment. CVVH had no\nsurvival benefit over and above that pro-\nvided by HP alone. Prophylactic CVVH can\nprevent early death caused by multiorgan\nfailure, but cannot prevent late pulmonary\nfibrosis.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nTable 1.
