Its\nincidence was reported to be around 1 in\npopulations.2 It causes ambiguous genitalia\nat birth in females and inefficient cortisol\nsynthesis in both genders. Three major\nphenotypes of CAH from 21-hydroxylase\ndeficiency (21-OHD) are described: the clas-\nsical salt-wasting form (SW), the classical\nsimple virilizing form at birth (SV), and the\nnon-classical form with late-onset symptoms\nand diagnosis (NC21-OHD).\nThe molecular defects in Chinese patients\nwith NC21-OHD have not been identified.\nTherefore, in the present study, we used a\nrapid mutation analysis method to ascertain\nthe prevalence of nine common mutations in\nCYP21A2 (complete allele deletion [Del];\nin exon 7). We also analyzed genotype\u00ad\nphenotype correlations in Chinese patients\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nEight female NC21-OHD patients aged\npatients (nine SW and 26 SV; 10 males and\nseen at the Department of Endocrinology,\nPeking Union Medical College Hospital\nwere included in the study. The diagnosis\nwas made according to clinical manifest-\nations and the 17-hydroxyprogesterone\n(17-OHP) assay.5 Polycystic ovary (PCO)\nwas diagnosed by ultrasound examination\nas either 12 or more follicles measuring\n2 \u00c6 9 mm in diameter, or an increased ovar-\nian volume (>10 cm3).6 All subjects were\nunrelated Han Chinese who lived in north-\nern China (provinces above the Yangtze\nRiver). All adult patients signed an informed\nconsent form for DNA analysis. Parents/\nguardians signed an informed consent form\nfor children. The study was approved by the\nEthics Committee of the Peking Union\nMedical College Hospital.\nMolecular analysis\nGenomic DNA was prepared from periph-\neral blood leukocytes using a QIAamp DNA\nBlood Mini Kit according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden,\nGermany).\nPCR amplification of CYP21A2 in several\nfragments was performed using oligonucleo-\ntide primers A1/A2, as shown in Table 1 and\ndescribed below. PCR products were\ndigested with Taq I to detect mutations,\nwith the wild-type pattern showing 210 bp\nand 187 bp bands of equal intensity. The\nabsence of one CYP21A2 allele was indi-\ncated by a weak 210 bp band, whereas\ncomplete absence of this band indicated\nthat both CYP21A2 alleles were absent.\nNo PCR product could be amplified from\npatients with a homozygous whole-allele\ndeletion or those with a deletion of\nbe ascertained if whole-allele deletion had\nbeen excluded.\nCYP21A2 point mutation detection\nUpstream (fragment 1; exons 1\u00ad3) and\nfragments of CYP21A2 were amplified using\nprimer pairs B1/B2 and C1/C2, respectively\n(Table 1).3,4 PCR products were purified\nusing the Wizard DNA clean-up system\nU restriction enzyme for 2\u00ad12 h. Mutations\nwere detected in exon 1 (p.Pro30Leu) using\n(p.Gln318Ter) using Pst I, and in exon 8\n(p.Arg356Trp) using Aci I. The digests were\nsubjected to electrophoresis on 2.5%\u00ad4.0%\nagarose gels (Table 2).\nPCR conditions\nPCR was performed with approximately\neach primer, and 2.5 U of Taq in a volume\nof 50 ml. PCR conditions were 30 cycles of\ndenaturation at 94C for 20 s, and annealing\ndetected using two rounds of PCR. One\nmicroliter of the first-round PCR product\n2 for p.Ile172Asn) was used as a template for\nthe second round of PCR with appropriate\nTable 1.

Six patients could not be classi-\nfied in this way because no mutation was\nidentified on one or both alleles. Nine of 11\npatients in Group A were SW.

These\nobservations should be confirmed by the\nmolecular analysis of additional Chinese\nThe relationship between phenotype\nand genotype\n21-OHD may increase in severity with a rise\nin the extent of 21-hydroxylase comprom-\nise.7\u00ad11 Mutations causing the complete loss\nof 21-hydroxylase activity are Del, E3\u00c18 bp,\n13A/C > G leads to almost no enzymatic\nactivity, while p.Ile172Asn causes a moder-\nate degree of compromise (1%\u00ad2% of wild-\ntype activity), and p.Pro30Leu and\np.Val281Leu are mild mutations that retain\nTo determine whether genotype can pre-\ndict phenotype, we classified the genotypes\ninto four groups according to severity.\nBecause 21-OHD is an autosomal recessive\ndisorder, the allele with the less severe\nmutation has the greater influence on pheno-\ntype.

We identified many similarities\nin the mutational spectrum between Chinese\nand Japanese NC21-OHD patients, but dis-\nparity was also noted. Thus, the\ncharacterization of NC21-OHD genotypes\nin different ethnic populations deserves fur-\nther study.\n"
