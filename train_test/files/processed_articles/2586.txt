Cunningham, MD, MPH\nBackground: A higher frequency of nonmonogamy, due in part to\nlower marriage prevalence, may contribute to elevated human immu-\nnodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted disease rates among\nolder blacks.\nMethods: To examine race and gender differences in nonmonogamy,\ntime spent single (i.e., not married or cohabiting), and HIV testing in\nolder adults, we analyzed US population-based data from the 2005\u00ad\nsexual participants ages 57 to 85 years.\nResults: Blacks spent greater portions of their adult lives single than\ndid Hispanics or whites and were far more likely to report recent\nindividuals reporting sex in the prior 5 years, nonmonogamous part-\nnerships were strongly associated with time spent single during the\nperiod. Control for time spent single and other covariates reduced the\nassociation of black race with nonmonogamous partnerships for men,\nbut increased it for women. Less than 20% reported ever testing for\nHIV; less than 6% had been recommended testing by a provider.\nTesting rates, highest in black men and white women, differed little by\nhistory of nonmonogamous partnerships within gender strata.\nConclusions: Singlehood helps to explain higher nonmonogamous\npartnership rates in older black men but not in older black women.\nOlder adults rarely receive or are recommended HIV testing, a key\nstrategy for reducing heterosexual HIV transmission.\nRacial/ethnic differences in human immunodeficiency virus/\nsexually transmitted disease (HIV/STD) risk have been\nwell documented in the general population and persist in older\nage groups. Higher rates are observed among blacks and His-\npanics than among whites and Asians.1,2 Although overall STD\nrates are much lower in older than in younger adults, significant\nracial/ethnic disparities are still observed in persons ages 45\nand older.3 Further, there is growing concern about the inci-\ndence and prevalence of STDs and HIV among older adults and\nthe implications of such infections for individual and public\nhealth. Overlapping or concurrent sexual relationships are key\nrisk factors for the spread of STDs and are more common\namong blacks than whites.4\u00ad6 Further, being single and sexu-\nally active or having a partner who has other sexual partners\nhave both been associated with high-risk human papillomavirus\nprevalence in older women.7 Lower rates of current marriage\nbetween black and white adults less than 45 years of age\nhelp to explain the elevated rates of overlapping partnerships\nobserved in blacks in this age group.6,8 However, neither the\nfrequency of overlapping partnerships, nor the role of mar-\nital status in its racial distribution have been examined\namong older adults.\nAlthough their rates of ever marriage differ little from\nolder adults of other groups, older blacks experience higher\ndivorce and age-specific mortality rates.9 Therefore, a large\nracial disparity exists in their prevalence of current mar-\nriage.10\u00ad12 Nevertheless, an individuals' current status as mar-\nried or not may be inadequate for assessing the association of\nmarital status with nonmonogamous partnerships in older pop-\nulations because individuals may be currently unmarried be-\ncause of recent widowhood or divorce, after having spent most\nof their of sexual histories married to a sexual partner.\nHIV and other STDs are growing concerns for older\nadults. New AIDS diagnoses among people older than 55 years\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 9%\nof all incident HIV cases in 2006 occurred among those age 50\nyears and more.16 Although HIV incidence remains low among\npeople age 60 years and older, those who do become infected\nin later life are more likely than younger people to go undiag-\nnosed.17,18 Other STDs are also relatively rare, but less likely to\nbe diagnosed promptly among older than younger adults, re-\nsulting in preventable transmission and morbidity.18\u00ad20\nData are needed to better understand the factors that\ncontribute to potentially risky partnerships in older adults and\nFrom the *Charles R.

The recent in-\ncreases in the prevalence and incidence of HIV/AIDS among\nolder adults likely results from multiple factors: (1) HIV treat-\nment advances, (2) rising divorce rates21 and changing sexual\nnorms,22,23 and (3) medical advances that prolong healthy life\nspans and successfully treat sexual dysfunction.24,25 Although\nmany older adults have spent much of their lives not exposed to\nSTDs because of long-term monogamous relationships, their\nrisk may change as individuals enter into new, potentially\nriskier partnerships following separation, divorce, or wid-\nowhood. Racial differences over time in rates of marriage,\ndivorce, remarriage, and mortality may lead to substantial\ndifferences in time spent single/noncohabiting among older\nadults and play a role in racial/ethnic disparities in exposure\nto risky partnerships.\nThe National Social Life, Health and Aging Project\n(NSHAP), which was designed to examine social relationships,\nsexuality and health in the United States in later life, provides\nan opportunity to examine these issues more closely. In this\narticle, we (1) describe racial and gender differences in marital\nand sexual relationship patterns among older adults, (2) exam-\nine correlates of nonmonogamy (i.e., sex with multiple partners\nover the same time period or sex with someone who has\nmultiple partners), including the influence of differences in\nmarriage patterns on racial/ethnic disparities in its occurrence,\nand (3) describe racial and gender differences in and assess the\ndegree to which persons in these types of risky relationships are\nrecommended for and obtain HIV testing.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\ntative probability sample of community dwelling persons 57 to\n84 years of age.26 Blacks, Hispanics, men, and persons ages 75\nto 84 years at the time of screening were oversampled. Of 4017\nsuccessfully interviewed, yielding a weighted response rate of\n75.5%.26 In-home interviews were conducted in English and\nquestionnaire was left behind for self-completion and returned\nthrough mail by 84% (86%, weighted) of the sample. Further\nsurvey details are provided elsewhere.26 The protocol was\napproved by the institutional review boards of the University of\nChicago and the National Opinion Research Center; this sub-\nstudy received exempt status from the Charles Drew University\nand UCLA institutional review boards.\nThis analysis excludes 62 participants who had missing\nmarriage/cohabitation histories, 19 who reported that either\ntheir most recent sexual partner or all of their lifetime partners\nwere of the same sex (numbers too small for subgroup analy-\nsis), and 20 whose responses to number of marital sexual\npartners exceeded their reported number of lifetime sexual\npartners and could not be reconciled with other data. In addi-\ntion, we excluded the relatively small number of remaining\nrespondents whose race/ethnicity was other than black, white,\nor Hispanic (n  79), resulting in an analytic sample of 2825.\nMEASURES\nNonmonogamous Partnerships\nRespondents were asked the month and year of their first\nand last sex for up to 3 sexual partners in the prior 5 years.\nRespondents were classified as having nonmonogamous part-\nnerships if they reported (a) sexual partnerships in the prior 5\nyears with overlapping start or end dates or (b) having a partner\nwho also had other sexual partners during their relationship\n(i.e., partner infidelity). Criteria \"a\" included individuals who\nreported a relationship that ended in the same month that\nanother started. In some instances, there may have been a short\ngap between theses partnerships.\nDue to the interview's modular design, not all partic-\nipants were asked the same partner fidelity question. A\nrandom two-third of the sample was asked: \"To the best of\nyour knowledge, how many people other than you has/did\n(PARTNER) had/have sex with during the course of your\nrelationship?\" referring to their 2 most-recent sexual partners in\nthe past 5 years, during the in-person interview. The remaining\none-third was asked \"To the best of your knowledge, has this\nperson had sex with someone other than yourself during the\ncourse of your relationship?\" referring only to their current\nsexual partner(s), in the leave-behind questionnaire.27 Those\nresponding yes to either partner infidelity question were clas-\nsified as having nonmonogamous partners. Those responding\n\"no\" to the partner infidelity questions or reporting no sexual\npartners in the prior 5 years were classified as not having\nnonmonogamous partnerships. In a sensitivity analysis, all 182\npersons responding \"don't know\" or refusing to answer the\npartner infidelity question were reclassified from missing to\nhaving nonmonogamous partners. In all analyses, missing val-\nues were assigned to those who had a partner in the last 5 years\nand received the leave-behind version of the question, but did\nnot answer the question (n  122) on their partners' monogamy\nstatus.\nSociodemographics and Self-Reported Health\nStatus\nGender was assessed by the interviewer. Race/ethnicity\nwas assessed by responses to the questions \"Do you consider\nyourself primarily white or Caucasian, black or African Amer-\nican, American Indian, Asian, or something else?\" and \"Do you\nconsider yourself Hispanic or Latino.\" For brevity, we label\nblack/African American and white/Caucasian participants who\nsaid no to the Hispanic question as black and white in the text.\nFurthermore, we describe 3 groups as racial groups because no\nfurther information on ethnicity was collected and because the\nHispanic category shares many characteristics with racial clas-\nsifications.28 Highest level of education was grouped into 4\ncategories. Responses to the 5-point self-reported physical\nhealth scale were grouped into excellent/very good, good, and\nfair/poor for analysis.\nSexual Attitudes\nWe also examined a number of attitudinal variables\nregarding sex and infidelity, including the importance of sex in\nthe respondents' life, the influence of religion on his or her\nsexual behavior, and the need for love in a sexual relationship.\nHigher scores indicated greater importance of these factors.\nThree questions ascertained participants' attitudes about extra-\nmarital sex in 3 circumstances: (1) any sex with a person\nbesides the spouse, (2) sex with another person when a spouse\nhas advanced dementia, or (3) sex with another person when a\nspouse is experiencing long-term physical illness. Response\noptions involved a 4-point scale from \"always wrong\" to\n\"not at all wrong\" with lower levels indicating higher per-\nceived immorality. Except the importance of sex question,\nNonmonagomy and HIV Testing Among Older Adults\nall attitudinal items were assessed on the leave-behind ques-\ntionnaire.\nNumber of Partners\nThe number of sexual partners for the respondent's\nlifetime and the 5 years before enrollment was also assessed.\nDetails about dates of first and last sex were obtained for the 3\nmost recent sexual partnerships in the 5-year period. Sex was\ndefined as \"any mutually voluntary activity with another person\nthat involves sexual contact, whether intercourse or orgasm\noccurs.\"\nPartnership Status and Duration\nA complete marital and cohabiting history was obtained,\nincluding dates of marriage/cohabitation, separation/divorce,\nand widowhood. We defined years spent cohabiting as the total\nnumber of years, between age 18 and the time of study partic-\nipation, during which respondents reported being married or\nliving in a romantic relationship with a partner. We then esti-\nmated the total duration and percentage of adult life and the\nprior 5 years spent \"single\" (i.e., unmarried/no cohabiting). We\nfurther attributed to \"premarriage\" the years preceding first\nmarriage, to \"divorce\" all years following divorce until the next\nmarriage or the interview date, and to \"widowhood\" all years\nfollowing death of a spouse until the next marriage or interview\ndate. We summed these time periods in order to estimate, for\nthe respondents' adult lifetimes and for their prior 5 years, the\ntotal duration and the percentage of single life attributed to each\n\"single\" relationship status.\nHIV Testing\nLifetime history of having ever testing for HIV or been\nrecommended for HIV testing by a medical provider was\nassessed in the leave-behind questionnaire.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe first examined the distribution of sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, physical health, and sexual attitudes and behav-\niors within each of the 6 strata of race and gender. We calcu-\nlated percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the\nTaylor series linearization method. Then, we estimated age-\nadjusted racial and gender distributions of current marital sta-\ntus, lifetime number of marriages, and percentage of adult life\nand the prior 5 years spent single.\nNext, we examined the predictors of nonmonogamous\npartnerships among those reporting at least one sexual partner\nin the prior 5 years. We were specifically interested in the\ninfluence of the number of the prior 5 years spent single on\nhaving a nonmonogamous partnership and any observed racial\ndisparities in this risk factor. We constructed separate multiple\nlogistic regressions by gender. First, we estimated the associ-\nation of race with nonmonogamous partnerships while adjust-\ning for age group. Then, we adjusted for the number of the prior\n5 years spent single and select covariates based on the litera-\nture. These included education, importance of sex, and physical\nWe examined HIV testing in separate analyses. Within\nstrata of race/ethnicity and gender, we estimated the frequency\nof having ever received HIV testing or been recommended HIV\ntesting by a medical provider among those reporting and not\nreporting nonmonogamous partnerships.\nWe used weights to adjust for differential selection prob-\nabilities and nonresponse for all analyses. We computed stan-\ndard errors with the use of the Taylor series linearization\nmethod,26 taking into account the stratification and clustering of\nthe sample design. Reported CIs do not include any adjustment\nfor multiple testing. Analyses were performed using SUDAAN\nstatistical software, version 10.0.1 (Research Triangle Park,\nNC) and SAS 9.2 (Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\nSociodemographics, Self-Reported Health\nStatus, and Sexual Attitudes\nAs shown in Table 1, black and Hispanic participants\nreport lower educational attainment than do whites. In compar-\nison with whites, black and Hispanic respondents were much\nmore likely to report fair or poor health, and women in these 2\ngroups reported poorer health than men. In contrast to racial\nand ethnic differences in socioeconomic and health character-\nistics, attitudes regarding sex were similar across groups. Most\nindividuals agreed that love was necessary for sex and that\nreligion shaped their sexual behaviors. In addition, most indi-\ncated that marital infidelity was \"wrong\" or \"almost always\nwrong.\" Among blacks and whites, women generally reported\nmore conservative attitudes regarding sex and marital infidelity\nthan did men. In contrast, attitudes among Hispanic men and\nwomen were more similar to one another and somewhat more\ntolerant of extramarital sex.\nNumber of Partners, Relationship Status\nBlack men reported a median of 4 lifetime partners\ncompared to 3 partners among white and Hispanic men. The\nmedian number of lifetime partners was 2 for white and black\nCI: 8.2, 11.0%) older adults reported at least one new sexual\npartnership in the 5 years before the survey; however, signifi-\ncant racial variations were observed. Black men and women\nwere much more likely than their Hispanic and white counter-\nparts to report having had new or multiple partners in the prior\n5 years. Black women were also more likely than white and\nHispanic women to report no sexual partners. More than 23%\nof blacks reported nonmonogamous partnerships in the prior 5\nyears compared to less than 11% of whites and Hispanics\n(Table 1).\nThe majority of older adults had been married at some\npoint in their lives, including 97.7% of black men and 94.4% of\nblack women. This compares to greater than 98% of white and\nHispanic men, and greater than 97% of white and Hispanic\nwomen. Blacks, however, were far less likely than Hispanics or\nwhites to be currently married (Table 2). The most dramatic\ndifferences were observed among women: black women were\n67% and 87% as likely to be married as white or Hispanic\nwomen, respectively. By comparison, black men were 82% as\nlikely to be married as were either white or Hispanic men.\nBlacks were also the least likely to report cohabitation with an\nunmarried partner. However, Black rates of multiple marriages\nare similar to whites. Hence, the higher rates of partnership\ndissolution and widowhood in blacks are not compensated for\nby higher rates of remarriage or cohabitation.\nBlack men and women spend respectively 40% and 60%\nmore of their adult lifetimes single than do whites. Hispanic\nmen and women spend approximately 20% more of their adult\nlifetimes than do whites. The lifetime distribution of single life\nalso differs for blacks and Hispanics compared with whites.\nBlacks spend relatively larger proportions of their \"time spent\nsingle\" following divorce or widowhood. Hispanics spend rel-\natively lower proportions of their \"time spent single\" following\nHarawa et al.\ndivorce. Across races, women spend larger proportions of their\nsingle adult life as divorced or widowed women than do men.\nBlack men spent 1.3 years of the prior 5 years single compared\nwith less than 0.8 years single for white and Hispanic men.\nBlack women spent 2.7 years single compared with less than 2\nyears for white and Hispanic women (Table 2).\nMultivariate Associations With\nNonmonogamous Partnerships\nTable 3 presents age-adjusted and multiple logistic regres-\nsion results examining correlates of nonmonogamous partnerships\namong participants with at least one sexual partner in the prior 5\nTABLE 1.

Medical provid-\ners were more likely to have recommended testing to blacks\nbut not to whites who reported nonmonogamous partner-\nships. Actual HIV test rates showed almost no association\nwith nonmonogamous partnerships for either group. Having\ntested for HIV was most common among black men (26.4%)\nand least common among black and Hispanic women (11.5%\nand 10.8%). Overall testing rates were somewhat higher\nSparse data limit gender comparisons among Hispanics.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, marital histories and the frequency of\npotentially risky relationships differ substantially by race/eth-\nnicity in older adults. Both nonmonogamous partnerships and\ntime spent single are highest among non-Hispanic blacks and\nTABLE 2.

The greater frequency of\nmultiple and new sex partners among blacks than whites or\nHispanics is a further indicator of potentially heightened HIV/\nSTD risk in this subpopulation. This is particularly true for\nblack men who report the highest frequencies of both. Although\nblack men are more likely than other race/gender groups to\nreport having tested for HIV or been recommended an HIV test,\ntesting rates are low across all subgroups, including black men\nwho report nonmonogamous partnerships.\nConsistent with research by Adimora et al.,6,8 we hy-\npothesized that the higher rates of nonmonogamy among blacks\nwould be partially explained by their greater likelihood of not\nbeing in a committed relationship for all or part of the assess-\nment period. However, when we controlled for the number of\nyears spent single, attenuation was only observed in the ORs\nassociated with race for males. Conversely, the ORs comparing\nsexually active black with sexually active white females in-\ncreased. Given that the nonmonogamous partnerships reported\nby black females were largely attributed to partner infidelity, it\nis possible that those black females who spent less time single\nand more time married had a greater opportunity to either\nexperience or discover partner infidelity.\nThe bivariate associations of attitudes regarding sexual\ninfidelity with race do not support that attitudinal differences\naccount for the observed racial differences in partnership pat-\nterns. Instead, it is possible that the factors contributing to\nnonmarriage and delayed marriage among younger blacks also\ncontribute to marital instability and infidelity among older\nheterosexual black couples. These are thought to include high\nrates of male incarceration that disrupt relationships,29,30 im-\nbalances in the ratios of men to women that may discourage\nfidelity among black men,31 un/underemployment of black\nmen, and a greater tendency for black men than black women\nto partner with other race/ethnicities--resulting in an even\nsmaller pool of available male partners for black women.32 The\ngreater imbalance in the number of older women to men among\nblacks than among whites or Hispanics is caused by racial and\ngender disparities in disease and injury that lead to increased\nmortality in black men compared to both black women and to\nmen of other race/ethnicities.11,29 Hence, reductions in the\ngender/race disparities in life expectancies may not only reduce\nsex-ratio imbalances but also lower racial disparities in risky\nrelationship patterns in older adults.\nThis study has several limitations. Although these anal-\nyses are based on events occurring over time, the data were\ncollected cross-sectionally and through self-report. Some par-\nticipants may have been unable to recall accurately all sexual\npartnerships in the last 5 years or the dates for first and last sex,\nmarriage/cohabitation, divorce/separation, and widowhood.\nOthers may have been unwilling to report having a nonmo-\nnogamous partner. To address the latter, we conducted sensi-\ntivity analyses, treating as yeses those responding don't know\nor refused to the question partner infidelity. The resulting\nmultivariate estimates differed little from when these responses\nwere treated as missing. Finally, because sex itself was defined\nso broadly, some respondents may have included partners with\nwhom they had only engaged in activities posing little-to-no\nHIV/STD risk. Nevertheless, just 4.6% of NSHAP respondents\nwho reported sexual activity in the prior 12 months, reported\nnever engaging in vaginal intercourse during the time period.\nDespite these limitations, the NSHAP data provide rare\nnationally representative data on sexual risk behaviors in a\ngrowing at-risk population, making the findings an important\naddition to the literature on health disparities and HIV/STD\nrisk in older adults.\nOur findings point to an important and potentially grow-\ning concern for the population, more and more of whom will\nspend significant periods of their adult lives single. Taboos and\nmisconceptions about later life sexuality may lead health care\nproviders to assume that older people are not at risk, and hence\nto not consider HIV/STDs in their differential diagnoses or\ndiscuss preventive measures and HIV screening with them.33,34\nOlder adults are unlikely to have received comprehensive sex-\nual education or risk-reduction training during their formative\nyears and now may lack the skills to practice safer sex or the\nrisk perception to seek out HIV testing.35,36 The higher rates of\nillicit drug use in recent than in earlier cohorts of older per-\nsons37 and the small numbers of prevention programs targeting\nolder people38,39 may also further contribute to increased HIV/\nSTD risk among each \"new generation\" of older people. To-\ngether, these factors highlight the need for increased and tai-\nlored services. Our finding that older blacks had fairly low HIV\ntesting rates (although greater than that of whites) is also cause\nfor concern. Although testing rates may increase with Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention's current guidelines that\nhealth care settings routinely offer opt-out HIV testing to\npatients ages 13 to 64 years,40 significant barriers to widespread\nTABLE 3.
