The majority of\nprevious studies have investigated only selected as-\npects of nutrition in relation to osteoporosis. Most\nstudies have focused on the associations between di-\netary calcium intake and bone mass or fracture risk.\nHowever, in order to evaluate the association between\ngeneral nutritional status and hip fracture risk, multi-\nple aspects of nutrition including dietary intake, bio-\nchemical markers, and anthropometric measurements\nneed to be considered simultaneously. Several clinical\nstudies have documented that elderly patients with hip\nfracture are likely to have poorer nutritional status on\nadmission to the hospital (1).

Himes, Division of Epidemiology,\nadequate intakes of most nutrients. The mean intakes\nof calories, protein, and calcium are only about 60\npercent of the recommended dietary allowance for\nelderly people (3). The poor nutritional status of hip\nfracture patients is further evident in their general\nemaciation and scarcity of muscle and fat tissues (4).\nAlthough malnutrition is often observed in the elderly,\nit appears that the situation is much worse in the\npatients with hip fractures than in the general aging\npopulation (5). The above studies suggest that poor\nnutritional status is associated with increased risk of\nhip fracture. However, nutritional status was measured\nafter the occurrence of hip fracture in these studies, so\nthat the temporal sequence of events was unclear. Few\ncohort studies have been done to prospectively inves-\ntigate whether general nutritional status affects subse-\nquent hip fracture risk.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the\nrelation between general nutritional status and subse-\nquent hip fracture risk in white women aged 45 years\nand over by using prospective data from the First\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES I) and its three follow-up studies. The\nhypothesis is that poor nutritional status, reflected by\ninadequate dietary intake, altered biochemical levels,\nNutrition and Subsequent Hip Fracture 125\nand reduced body mass and soft tissues, increases the\nrisk for subsequent hip fracture. Selected aspects of\nthe data have been analyzed before. Looker et al. (6)\ninvestigated the relation between dietary calcium in-\ntake and hip fracture risk and did not find a statistically\nsignificant association. Farmer et al. (7) and DiPietro\net al. (8) examined anthropometric indicators and hip\nfracture risk and found that women with higher body\nmass index, arm muscle area, and triceps skinfold\nthickness experienced a lower risk of hip fracture. In\nthe present study, multiple variables from three as-\npects of nutrition including dietary intake, biochemical\nmarkers, and anthropometric measurements are inves-\ntigated simultaneously in relation to subsequent hip\nfracture to more completely examine the association\nbetween general nutritional status and hip fracture\nrisk.\nStudy design and population\nNHANES I was conducted by the National Center\nstratified, probability sample of the civilian, noninsti-\ntutionalized population in the United States. The sam-\nA wide variety of nutrition information was collected\nin this survey. Then, three NHANES I epidemiologic\n25-74 years of age and who underwent medical ex-\namination in NHANES I. The 1986 follow-up study\nwas conducted on those who were 55-74 years old at\nthe NHANES I baseline examination and not known to\nless of their tracing status in that study. The follow-up\ncohort included 3,980 eligible persons. The third\nfollow-up study took place in 1987. The entire non-\ndeceased follow-up cohort aged 25-74 years at base-\nline (11,750 persons) was recontacted, regardless of\nwhether they had previously been followed. The de-\nsign and data collection procedures of these three\nfollow-up studies were very similar. Data collection\nconsisted of interviews with the subjects or with their\nproxies for those who were incapacitated or deceased,\nacquiring death certificates for decedents, and obtain-\ning health care facility (hospital and nursing home)\novernight stay records for all subjects. All hospital and\nnursing home records were receded by trained medical\ncoders using International Classification of Diseases,\nNinm Revision (ICD-9), codes. Death certificates\nwere coded by using the ICD-9 multiple cause-of-\ndeatii codes.\nThe subjects for the present study were restricted to\nyears or older and who had a medical examination in\nthe NHANES I. In total, 3,335 of the eligible women\nwere followed in at least one of the follow-up studies,\nand 209 women (5.9 percent) were lost to follow-up in\nthe three follow-up studies. Six women with hip frac-\ntures caused by severe trauma were excluded from the\nstudy. In addition, 764 women with malignant tumors\nor incomplete information on baseline variables were\nexcluded from the analysis. The final cohort included\nMeasurement methods\nHeight, weight, upper arm girth, triceps skinfold,\nand subscapular skinfold were measured in the\nNHANES I by standardized procedures with the sub-\nject wearing only a paper gown and foam rubber\nslippers (9, 10). Body mass index was calculated as\nweight (kg)/height (m)2. The average of triceps and\nsubscapular skinfolds was computed and used in the\ndata analysis. Arm muscle area (cm2) was calculated\nas an indicator of protein-energy malnutrition by using\nthe Heymsfield formula (11): arm muscle area =\n[(upper arm girth -- 3.14 X triceps skinfold)2/(4 X\nA dietary interview including a 24-hour dietary re-\ncall and a food frequency questionnaire was conducted\nby professional dietary staff in the NHANES I. The\nintakes of total energy, carbohydrate, protein, calcium,\nand phosphorus were computed from uie 24-hour di-\netary recall data. The food frequency questionnaire\nwas administered to obtain the usual frequencies of\nconsumption of food items during the preceding 3\nmonths (12, 13). The total frequency of consumption\nof dairy products including whole milk, skim milk,\ncheese, and cheese dishes was derived from the food\nfrequency questionnaire and used as an independent\nvariable in the data analyses.\nA blood sample was drawn by venipuncture at base-\nline examination. Serum total protein and albumin\nwere assessed by using standard laboratory techniques\nCovariates of interest included age, menopausal sta-\ntus, parity, physical activity, alcohol use, and previous\nfracture history. All of them were collected in the\nbaseline survey. Menopausal status was determined by\nasking the subject whether her menstrual periods had\nentirely stopped at the time of the NHANES I. Parity\nstatus was categorized as high parity (three live births\nor more), low parity (less than three live births), and\nnull parity. The frequency of alcohol drinking was\ndichotomized as frequent (drinking from two to three\ntimes a week or more) and less frequent (drinking less\nfrequently than from two to three times a week or\nnever). The information about physical activity was\nderived by asking the respondents two questions about\ntheir recreational and nonrecreational activities. The\nrespondents reported their activities as active, moder-\nate, or inactive. Physical activity was categorized as\n\"high\" if the responses to both questions were active,\n\"low\" if the responses to both questions were inactive,\nand \"medium\" if the responses were all other combi-\nnations of answers to the two questions. A previous\nhistory for any bone fracture was categorized as \"pos-\nitive\" and \"negative\" according to self-reports.\nHip fracture outcomes\nIn the three follow-up interviews, the respondents\nwere asked questions on hip fracture. Hip fracture was\nincluded only if the date at which the fracture occurred\nwas after the date of the NHANES I interview; other-\nwise, the fracture was treated as a previous hip frac-\nture. Altogether, 153 women reported incident nip\nfractures.\nThe hospital and nursing home records collected in\nthe three follow-up studies were searched for the di-\nagnosis of hip fracture (ICD-9 code 820). All death\ncertificates received were also searched for ICD-9\nfractures caused by low-energy trauma (ascertained by\nchecking the external causes for hip fractures on the\nhospital records) were identified either by the health\ncare facility records or by death certificates.\nSelf-reported hip fractures were validated by health\ncare facility records and death certificates. As a result,\n101 cases were confirmed by either facility records or\ndeath certificates; 52 self-reported hip fractures were\nnot verified; 29 hip fractures were not reported but\nuncovered in records or death certificates.\nThe information from health care facility records\nand death certificates was used to define incident hip\nfracture cases. Thus, only 130 hip fractures identified\nby health care facility records or by death certificates\nwere treated as cases; the 52 unconfirmed self-\nreported hip fractures were excluded from the analy-\nsis. The final analysis included 2,513 white women\nwith 130 incident hip fractures.\nData analysis\nNutritional variables and covariates collected in the\nbaseline survey were compared between women with\nand without a subsequent hip fracture by using the\nStudent t test for continuous variables and x* test for\ncategorical variables.\nThe relations between baseline nutritional variables\nand subsequent hip fracture risk were examined by\nusing Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.\nCrude and age-adjusted analyses were conducted first.\nNutritional variables and age were entered into Cox\nmodels as continuous independent variables, with the\nfollow-up time to incident hip fracture as the depen-\ndent variable. The time to incident hip fracture for hip\nfracture cases was defined as the time between the\nbaseline interview and the date of the first incident hip\nfracture. For noncases, the follow-up time was com-\nputed as the time between the baseline interview and\nthe date of the last interview for survivors or between\nthe baseline interview and the date of death for dece-\ndents. Crude and age-adjusted relative risks were com-\nputed as the exponents of the regression coefficients.\nThe relation between nutrition and subsequent hip\nfracture risk was further examined by multiple vari-\nable Cox regression analysis. Because nutritional vari-\nables tend to be correlated with each other and because\nhigh collinearity among variables would result in an\nunstable model in multiple-variable analysis, only the\nmost significant and representative variables or the\nrelatively independent variables were selected from\neach aspect of nutrition for the final analysis. Since\nweight, body mass index, skinfold, upper arm girth,\nand arm muscle area were highly correlated with each\nsince body weight includes both fat and muscle com-\nponents, it is reasonable to assume that weight can\nadequately represent skinfold, upper arm girth, and\narm muscle area. Although body mass index is another\nimportant variable, it was calculated from weight and\nheight and not independent from other measures of\nbody size. Thus, weight was chosen for the multiple-\nvariable analysis. Height was a relatively independent\nvariable, so that it was used for the multiple-variable\nanalysis. Dietary variables from the 24-hour recall\ninterview were also correlated with each other (corre-\ntotal energy intake includes protein and carbohydrate\nintakes and is closely related to calcium and phospho-\nrus intakes, it seems that total energy intake is the most\nreasonable variable to represent general dietary intake.\nHence, total energy intake was selected for the\nmultiple-variable analysis. Among the biochemical\nvariables tested, only serum albumin was significantly\n(p < 0.05) related to subsequent hip fracture risk;\nthus, it was used to represent biochemical markers in\nthe multiple-variable analysis. In order to ensure that\nvariable selection was sound, several multiple-variable\nmodels containing different anthropometric variables\nwere compared. The model with height and weight\nNutrition and Subsequent Hip Fracture 127\nwas the best-fit model in terms of the log likelihood\nratio test. No other anthropometric variables achieved\nstatistical significance in the model including height\nand weight. Likewise, the model containing dietary\ntotal energy intake was the best-fit model compared\nwith those with other dietary variables, and no other\ndietary variables reached significant levels in the\nmodel containing total energy intake. Thus, the final\nmultiple-variable model included height, weight, total\nenergy intake, and serum albumin while simulta-\nneously controlling for covariates, i.e., age, previous\nfracture history, menopausal status, parity, physical\nactivity, and frequency of alcohol use.\nRESULTS\nThe average length of follow-up was 13.4 years.\nThe incidence rates of hip fracture for various age\ngroups are shown in table 1. The rates of hip fracture\nincreased substantially with age. Women older than 70\nyears had a rate 13 times higher than younger women\nTable 2 compares basic characteristics between\nwomen with and without subsequent hip fracture.\nWomen with hip fracture were 6 years older on aver-\nage. Their anthropometric measurements were gener-\nally smaller. They had significantly lower body\nweight, body mass index, skinfold, upper arm girth,\nand arm muscle area measurements than women with-\nout hip fracture. The differences between the two\ngroups also appeared in biochemical markers. The\nserum albumin level was significantly lower in the hip\nfracture group, although the difference in serum total\nprotein was not statistically significant. Women who\ndeveloped a subsequent hip fracture tended to have\npoorer dietary intakes; their total energy, carbohy-\ndrate, protein, and phosphorus intakes were signifi-\ncantly lower; and their calcium intakes were margin-\nTABLE 1.

As for the differences in covariates,\nsignificantly higher percentages of women with sub-\nsequent hip fracture were postmenopausal and had\nprevious fracture history. The percentage distributions\nwith regard to physical activity, parity, and frequency\nof alcohol use were not significantly different between\nthe two groups.\nThe crude and age-adjusted relative risks of subse-\nquent hip fracture associated with a 1-standard devia-\ntion increment in independent variables (relative risk\nfor age was relative to a 10-year increment) are pre-\nsented in table 3 along with 95 percent confidence\nintervals. Age was significantly related to hip fracture.\nA 10-year increment in age resulted in a 3.42-fold\nincrease in subsequent hip fracture risk. When anthro-\npometric measurements except height were increased\n1 standard deviation, the crude and age-adjusted rela-\ntive risks for hip fracture significantly decreased by\n24-31 percent. For biochemical markers, both crude\nand age adjusted, a reduced serum albumin concentra-\ntion was associated with increased risk of subsequent\nhip fracture, whereas serum total protein was not sig-\nnificantly related to hip fracture risk. The crude rela-\ntive risks for a 1-standard deviation increase in dietary\ntotal energy, carbohydrate, protein, and phosphorus\nsignificant. However, after controlling for age, we\nfound that only the relative risk for dietary carbohy-\ndrate remained statistically significant. The crude and\nage-adjusted relative risks for dietary calcium intake\nand total frequency of dairy product consumption did\nnot achieve statistical significance.\nThe multiple-variable-adjusted relative risks are\npresented in table 4. The multivariable relative risk for\nage was similar to the crude relative risk estimate,\nindicating that age was an independent risk factor for\nhip fracture. The inverse relations between body\nweight, serum albumin, and total energy intake and hip\nfracture remained significant in the multiple-variable\nmodel, suggesting that poor nutritional status, re-\nflected from reduced body mass, low serum albumin\nconcentration, and inadequate dietary intake, may el-\nevate the risk for subsequent hip fracture. The\nmultiple-variable analysis also indicated that height\nwas a significant risk factor for hip fracture.\nTo further examine the association between levels\nof nutritional status and hip fracture risk, nutritional\nvariables were divided into several categories by per-\ncentiles.

Using the group with serum albumin\nabove the 75th percentile as reference, we show that\nreduced serum albumin increased the risk for subse-\nquent hip fracture. When serum albumin was de-\ncreased to the first percentile or less, the risk of hip\nfracture was dramatically increased by threefold (p <\n0.05), which suggests a possible threshold effect at the\nextremely low values. Likewise, figures 2, 3, and 4\ndisplay the multiple-variable-adjusted relative risks\naccording to the percentiles of total energy intake,\nbody weight, and height. A striking increase in hip\nobserved when total energy intake was reduced to the\nfirst percentile or less. As body weight decreased, the\nrisk for subsequent hip fracture was dramatically in-\ncreased, especially at extremely low values. Decreased\nbody height was significantly associated with de-\ncreased risk of hip fracture after adjusting for multiple\nvariables. These data strongly suggest that undernutri-\ntion substantially increases the risk for subsequent hip\nfracture in elderly women.\nThe multiple-variable analysis also showed that pre-\nvious fracture history was an important predictor for\nsubsequent hip fracture. Those who had a previous\nbone fracture experienced a higher risk for hip fracture\ncompared with those without previous fracture (rela-\n3.75). Physical activity, menopausal status, parity, and\nfrequency of alcohol use were not significant in the\nmultiple-variable analysis.\nPossible interactions among independent variables\nwere explored by adding interaction terms into the\nmultiple-variable model, and none of the interactions\nachieved statistical significance {p > 0.05).\nDISCUSSION\nThis prospective study investigated three aspects of\nnutritional status simultaneously in relation to subse-\nquent hip fracture risk. It was shown that poor nutri-\ntional status, reflected from inadequate dietary energy\nintake, reduced serum albumin, and decreased body\nmass and soft tissues, was significantly associated\nwith higher risk of subsequent hip fracture.\nAlthough dietary calcium is assumed to be an im-\nportant nutrient that influences bone mass and bone\nNutrition and Subsequent Hip Fracture 129\nTABLE 3.

This\nresult is not surprising. Previous research has indicated\nthat dietary calcium may exert the greatest impact on\nthe bone during childhood and adolescence rather than\nin late adulthood. Higher dietary calcium intake during\nchildhood and adolescence results in greater calcium\nretention and skeletal deposition; therefore, it pro-\nmotes maximal peak bone mass (15-17). After peak\nbone mass has been reached, calcium intake is related\nto bone mass maintenance. Although it is assumed that\nadequate calcium intake will retard bone mineral loss\nand help to reduce bone fracture risk (18, 19), evi-\ndence for a direct relation between dietary calcium\nintake and bone mineral content and hip fracture risk\nis weak and inconsistent. In the four prospective stud-\nies that directly investigated the relation between cal-\ncium intake and hip fracture risk, only one study\nshowed that higher calcium intake was linked to a\nsignificant decrease in subsequent risk of hip fracture\n(6, 20-22). Because any particular nutrient occurs in\nfoods along with other nutrients, the multicollinearity\namong nutrients makes it very difficult to separate the\neffect of a particular nutrient from another. It may be\nthat not just one particular nutrient but the combined\neffects of nutrients, the general dietary intake, and\nnutritional status are important in determining bone\nhealth and subsequent hip fracture risk.\nThis study showed that reduced serum albumin con-\ncentration was significantly associated with a higher\nrisk of hip fracture, whereas serum total protein was\nnot related to hip fracture risk. Serum albumin is one\nof the common biochemical parameters to monitor\nnutritional status. Because the half-life of albumin is\nonly 20 days (23) and because an early effect of\nprotein deprivation is to reduce albumin synthesis and\nresult in hypoalbuminemia (24), serum albumin is a\nsensitive indicator of early nutritional inadequacy. Se-\nrum total protein includes different kinds of serum\nproteins that may have different responses to nutri-\ntional inadequacy. Thus, serum total protein content is\nless sensitive to nutritional inadequacy. The signifi-\ncant association between serum albumin and hip frac-\nTABLE 4.

The dramatic increases in relative risks at\nthe extremely low values of serum albumin, total en-\nergy intake, and weight strongly suggest that poor\nnutritional status elevates the risk for hip fracture in\nelderly women. Although the extremely low values\nmight be associated with measurement error, the risks\nrelated to these values were striking and statistically\nsignificant, suggesting that the observed risks could\nnot be explained by measurement error alone and that\nthere might be threshold effects.\nHeight was not significant in the crude and age-\nadjusted analyses, but it became a significant risk\nfactor for hip fracture in the multiple-variable analysis.\nThis is because when other variables, especially\nweight, are uncontrolled, height hardly reflects wom-\nen's current nutritional status. When holding weight\nand other variables constant, taller women are rela-\ntively thinner, have less soft tissue, and are therefore at\ngreater risk for hip fracture. This agrees with the result\nthat poor nutritional status and thinness in elderly\nwomen are linked to higher risk of hip fracture.\nThere is a biologic basis for an association between\nnutritional status and hip fracture risk. First, poor\nnutritional status adversely influences bone health.\nInadequate dietary intake and nutritional deficiency\nmay negatively affect the balance between bone for-\nmation and bone resorption, thereby influencing bone\nfragility and inducing osteoporosis (25). It has also\nbeen hypothesized that women with greater body mass\nhave more estrogen, which may significantly decrease\nbone loss and protect against osteoporotic fractures\n(26-28). In addition, heavier weight may exert a sig-\nnificant mechanical loading on the bone (29), which is\nan important stimulus for bone gain, and therefore\nmay lead to greater bone density and reduced fracture\nrisk. Second, poor nutritional status contributes to\ngeneral feebleness, which increases the propensity to\nfall and thereby the risk of hip fracture by influencing\ncentral nervous system processing time, impairing co-\nordination, and reducing muscle strength (4, 30).\nThird, poor nutritional status may affect a mechanical\nprotective mechanism. Undernourished elderly indi-\nviduals have less muscle and fat tissues around the hip,\nand therefore less soft tissue padding and passive\nprotection, which may increase the risk of developing\nan osteoporotic hip fracture when falls occur (1, 31).\nThe results from this study agree with those from\nother studies that age is a strong risk factor for hip\nfracture (32). Many factors may change with age, such\nas quantitative and qualitative aspects of the bone,\nincreased frequency of falling, and deteriorating nutri-\ntional status, which may contribute to the increasing\nrisk of hip fracture with increasing age (33).\nAs found in other studies (34, 35), previous fracture\nhistory is another significant risk factor. The women\nhaving previous fractures are generally more osteopo-\nrotic and two times more likely to have a subsequent\nhip fracture.\nThe crude analysis in this study showed that post-\nmenopausal women were four times more likely to\ndevelop a hip fracture than premenopausal women.\nHowever, menopausal status was closely related to age\nso that, after adjusting for age, the relation between\nmenopausal status and hip fracture risk was no longer\nsignificant.\n\u00b7Self-reported physical activity was not significantly\nlinked to hip fracture risk in this study. One possibility\nis that physical activity might not be accurately mea-\nsured by self-report. Because different individuals\nmay have different interpretations about physical ac-\ntivity levels, the self-reported activity might be asso-\nciated with considerable misclassification. Previous\nstudies have indicated that total energy intake can be\nused as a measure of long-term habitual physical ac-\ntivity (36). If this is so, the significant inverse associ-\nation between total energy intake and hip fracture risk\nin this study may suggest that reduced physical activ-\nity is related to increased risk of hip fracture.\nSome studies have suggested that high parity may\nprotect against osteoporotic fractures (37). However,\nnot all of the studies have observed the favorable\neffects. This study showed that women with three live\nbirths or more had a risk of developing a subsequent\nhip fracture similar to the risk of those with null parity.\nMost of the subjects in this study were not heavy\ndrinkers, which might be the reason why we could not\nfind a relation between alcohol use and hip fracture\nrisk. The data from other studies showed that only\nlong-term and heavy alcohol consumption was asso-\nciated with a modestly increased risk of hip fracture in\nThe above analyses were repeated by an alternative\napproach of defining hip fracture cases. All incident\nhip fractures identified by facility records, death cer-\ntificates, or self-reporting were treated as cases; that is,\nthe 52 unconfirmed self-reported hip fractures were\nincluded as cases. This approach accommodated the\nfacts that the health care facility record data were not\ncomplete, some records could not be obtained because\nNutrition and Subsequent Hip Fracture 133\nthe subjects refused to sign the Medical Authorization\nForm, or the hospitals and nursing homes refused to\nparticipate or could not be contacted.

The results from this approach\nshowed that the directions of the relations between\nnutritional variables and hip fracture risk remained the\nsame; however, the magnitudes of the associations\nwere attenuated, and the relative risks became less\nsignificant (data not shown). It is suggested that the\nsecond approach of case definition was associated\nwith appreciable misclassification in the outcome vari-\nable, and there existed some extent of reporting error\nin self-reported hip fracture data. Hence, data interpre-\ntation and conclusions should be based on the first\napproach.\nIn summary, nutritional status is significantly linked\nto subsequent hip fracture risk. Poor nutritional status,\nevident in inadequate dietary intake, decreased serum\nalbumin, and reduced body mass and soft tissues,\npredisposes women to hip fracture. Thus, maintaining\na well-nourished status in the elderly should be con-\nsidered as one important approach to prevent hip\nfracture.\n"
