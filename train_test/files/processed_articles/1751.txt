At the census tract level, high informal\nlevels were also associated with failing to meet the MVPA\nguidelines (when adjusted for sociodemographic charac-\nteristics).

Neigh-\nborhood conditions can affect where and\nhow adolescents spend their time.4 Be-\ncause parents may be influenced by haz-\nardousneighborhoodconditions,theymay\nwant to keep their younger children inside\nofthehome,5 fearingthattheirchildrenmay\nget into trouble if they spend time outside\nwithout proper supervision. Thus, chil-\ndren and adolescents may not be able to\nspend their time on active outdoor activi-\nties even if they want to unless their neigh-\nborhood provides appropriate environ-\nments, such as parks, gyms, playgrounds,\nrecreational facilities, and/or sidewalks.6-8\nSeveral theoretical frameworks have\nbeen proposed to understand the associa-\ntion between neighborhood conditions and\nadolescents' behaviors in general. The in-\nstitutional resource model for contextual\neffects assumes that various types of re-\nsources in the community (eg, schools,\nchild care, parks, and libraries) could in-\nfluence neighborhood residents' out-\ncomes.9 Inner-city neighborhood struc-\ntural conditions, defined as concentrated\npoverty, immigrant concentration, unem-\nployment, and/or residential mobility, were\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Social Welfare,\nSeoul Women's University,\nSeoul, Korea (Dr Kim); and\nDepartments of Epidemiology\nand Biostatistics (Drs Liu and\nColabianchi) and Exercise\nScience (Dr Pate), Arnold\nSchool of Public Health,\nUniversity of South Carolina,\nColumbia.\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

For ex-\nample, Burdette and Whitaker3 found that, after adjust-\nment for sociodemographic factors, mothers' percep-\ntion of higher neighborhood safety was related to lower\ntelevision viewing hours in their children. To our knowl-\nedge, no studies have simultaneously included a com-\nprehensive set of both structural and perceptual neigh-\nborhood factors in the model of adolescents' physical\nactivities and sedentary behaviors.\nIn this cross-sectional study using the data from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth), we aim to fill this gap in the literature by ex-\namining the associations of both structural and percep-\ntual neighborhood factors with adolescents' physical\nactivities and sedentary behaviors. This study will shed\nnew light on understanding additive and independent\ncontributions of the 2 different facets of neighborhood\nfactors on adolescents' physical activity and sedentary be-\nhaviors. Furthermore, individual perception of neigh-\nborhood factors were aggregated in their neighborhood\nand included in the model to capture macroscopic col-\nlective neighborhood perceptions. We hypothesized that,\nafter adjustment for individual-level sociodemographic\nfactors and individual- and census tract\u00adlevel percep-\ntion of neighborhood conditions, adolescents' odds of not\nmeetingphysicalactivityguidelinesandofexcessivescreen\ntime are positively associated with structural neighbor-\nhood characteristics (eg, higher poverty, higher immi-\ngrant concentration, and lower residential stability).\nWe also hypothesized that these 2 behaviors are posi-\ntively associated with individual perception about the\nneighborhood conditions and average neighborhood\nperception about neighborhood conditions (eg, lower in-\nformal control, lower acquaintanceship, and higher pub-\nlic nuisance) after adjusting for structural neighborhood\ncharacteristics.\nMETHODS\nAdd Health is a nationally representative, school-based study of\nwave I data of Add Health. Of 20 745 adolescents who were en-\nlescents who had any type of physical disability and 2946 ado-\nlescents with missing values in any neighborhood variables. In\naddition, we eliminated 2200 adolescents owing to listwise de-\nletion of missing values in the covariates used in the models. Fi-\nnally, we excluded 2 adolescents who did not provide valid an-\nswers to the sedentary behavior questions, resulting in a final\nIn the in-home interviews, Add Health researchers used a 7-day\nrecall questionnaire that is commonly used in other large-scale\nepidemiologic studies to assess daily physical activities and sed-\nentary behaviors.20-22 Based on self-reports, we developed a mea-\nsure of meeting physical activity recommendations, defined as\nparticipating in 5 or more bouts of moderate to vigorous physi-\ncal activity (MVPA) per week.23 In our analysis, MVPA referred\nto activities that cost 5 to 8 metabolic equivalents. Metabolic\nequivalentswereassignedusingacompendium24 inwhich1meta-\nbolic equivalent is defined as the energy expenditure associated\nwith quiet sitting. Three of 5 questions were related to MVPA\nandusedtocalculateeachadolescent'sboutsofMVPA.Theywere\nworded as \"During the past week, how many times did you . . . \"\nand followed by a description of a specific MVPA activity: (1)\nroller/bicycling (eg, rollerblading, rollerskating, skateboarding,\nor bicycling); (2) active sports (eg, baseball, softball, basketball,\nsoccer,swimming,orfootball),and(3)exercise(eg,jogging,walk-\ning, karate, jumping rope, gymnastics, or dancing). The follow-\ning scores were assigned to each answer category: 0 (not at all),\nfurther dichotomized the sum of MVPA scores into those meet-\ning the MVPA guideline (5 bouts of MVPA per week) and those\nfailingtomeettheMVPAguideline(5boutsofMVPAperweek).\nSedentary behaviors were assessed via 3 questions. Each was\nworded as \"How many hours a week do you . . . \" and in-\nvolved activities like watching television and videos and play-\ning video or computer games. Answers to these 3 questions were\nsummed to create a total time (hours per week) that adoles-\ncents spent on sedentary activities. Twenty-five respondents who\nhours. Using national guidelines,25,26 we defined exceeding rec-\nommended total screen time as more than 2 hours per day.\nPerceptual domain of neighborhood factors was captured by 3\nsummary variables (ie, public nuisance, acquaintanceship, and\ninformal control) measured at the individual level.

These aggregated variables measure macroscopic and col-\nlective contextual aspects of the neighborhood perceptions\nmeasured at the individual level. Social scientists have widely\nused this approach to capture contextual effects based on indi-\nvidual-level characteristics.29 This resulted in 3 census tract\u00ad\nlevel perceptual domain neighborhood factors (ie, acquaintance-\nship, informal control, and public nuisance variables). We\ncalculated the reliability of these aggregate variables based on in-\ndividual-level responses using the procedure suggested by\nO'Brien.29 We chose the 1990 census tract as the geographical\nboundary of a neighborhood unit because census tracts are large\nenough to provide a reliable and homogeneous aggregated mea-\nsureofcharacteristics30 andsmallenoughtobeconsideredaneigh-\nin a census tract, and 697 (5.1%) respondents lived in a tract with\n1 respondent to Add Health. In the final analysis sample, 13 668\nrespondents were from 1974 different census tracts.\ning and colleagues12 identified concentrated poverty, immigrant\nconcentration, and residential stability as key structural neigh-\nborhood factors associated with adolescent outcomes. Nine cen-\nsus measures were selected based on theories and previous stud-\nies and subject to principal components analysis to create the 3\nstructural neighborhood factor scores.12 Concentrated poverty\nwas measured by the proportion of households with an income\nbelowpovertylevel,publicassistance,singlefemale\u00adheadedhouse-\nholds, and unemployment rate. Immigrant concentration score\nwas calculated using the proportion of Hispanic and foreign-\nborn individuals and those with limited English skills. Residen-\ntial stability score was assessed by the proportion of households\nliving in the same house for 5 years or longer and the proportion\nof housing occupied by owners. Because our neighborhood con-\ntextualmeasureswerecreatedbasedonmultipleitems,eachmea-\nsure used a different scale. To facilitate the interpretation of re-\nsults, both the perceptual and structural domain neighborhood\nfactor scores were divided into tertiles to provide for an equal\nnumber of participants in each response category.\nWe considered a number of sociodemographic variables in our\nanalyses. They were adolescents' age, sex, race/ethnicity, in-\nschool status, region and nativity from the in-home question-\nnaire, and the highest parental education and household in-\ncome from the Parent Questionnaire.\nMultilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the\nassociations between these neighborhood factors and adoles-\ncents' physical activity (failure to meet MVPA guideline: 5\nbouts per week) and sedentary behavior (excessive screen time:\n2 hours per day), controlling for all covariates. We tested the\ninteraction terms between sex and each neighborhood factor.\nNone of them were statistically significant at P.05. Thus, we\ndid not provide sex-stratified results. Stata,33 version 10, was\nused for the statistical analyses.\nRESULTS\nCHARACTERISTICS\nOur final analysis sample was 49% female and 51% male;\nPacificIslander,and4%ofotherracial/ethnicorigin.Among\nthem, 95% were born in the United States.

This\nstudy contributes to the existing literature by placing its\nfocusonbothperceptualandstructuralneighborhoodchar-\nacteristics and their associations with adolescents' MVPA\nand screen time using data from a large nationally repre-\nsentative sample. If future studies can further replicate our\nfindings, this would suggest that, to combat obesity and\nphysical inactivity epidemics in the United States, public\nhealth professionals and pediatric care providers should\ntake into account the important roles of perceived and\nstructural neighborhood characteristics in behavioral\nchoices above and beyond individual attributes.\nTable 4.
