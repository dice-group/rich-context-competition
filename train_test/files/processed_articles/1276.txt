Using data from 8,807 participants age >20 years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (1988\u00ad1994), we determined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among individuals with gout and quantified\nthe magnitude of association between the 2 conditions.

With the original NCEP/ATP criteria, the corresponding prevalences were slightly lower,\nwhereas the corresponding odds ratios were slightly higher. The stratified prevalences of metabolic syndrome by major\nassociated factors of gout (i.e., body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes) remained substantially and significantly\nhigher among those with gout than those without gout (all P values <0.05).\nConclusion. These findings indicate that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is remarkably high among individuals\nwith gout. Given the serious complications associated with metabolic syndrome, this frequent comorbidity should be\nrecognized and taken into account in long-term treatment and overall health of individuals with gout.\nKEY WORDS. Gout; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Hypertension; Insulin resistance; NHANES-III.\nINTRODUCTION\nMetabolic syndrome, which consists of multiple interre-\nlated conditions, increases the risk for atherosclerotic car-\ndiovascular disease up to 3 times and increases the risk for\ntype 2 diabetes up to 5 times (1,2). Metabolic syndrome\nalso increases mortality from cardiovascular disease and\nall causes (3,4). The syndrome affects 50 million Amer-\nThe potential link between gout, a common inflamma-\ntory arthritis, and metabolic syndrome has been repeatedly\nsuggested (6\u00ad8), but no quantitative population data are\navailable; therefore, the magnitude of the problem remains\nunclear. The proposed connection has been supported by\nthe close association between hyperuricemia and insulin\nresistance syndrome (6,9,10). For example, a cross-sec-\ntional study of 4,053 young adults found close associations\nbetween hyperuricemia and the individual metabolic ab-\nnormalities of the syndrome including hyperinsulinemia,\nhypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity (10). Renal clear-\nance of urate is inversely related to the degree of insulin\nresistance (11). Therefore, the reduced renal excretion of\nurate among patients with metabolic syndrome may ex-\nplain the increased frequency of hyperuricemia. Further-\nmore, recent case series reported that the prevalence of\nmetabolic syndrome was high among patients with gout\n1Hyon K.

Because the serious implications of met-\nabolic syndrome for overall health of individuals with\ngout are substantial, we determined the prevalence of the\nsyndrome among patients with gout and examined the\nassociation between the 2 conditions based on the Third\nNational Health and  \nthe NHANES-III included a representative sample of the\nnoninstitutionalized US civilian population, which was\nselected using a multistage, stratified sampling design.\nPersons 60 years of age and African American and Mex-\nican American persons were oversampled. After a home\ninterview, participants were invited to attend examination\nsessions where blood and urine specimens were obtained.\nIn the current study, we analyzed data for 8,807 men and\nnonpregnant women at least 20 years of age who attended\nthe medical examination, had fasted at least 8 hours prior\nto the blood collection, and had complete information to\nallow definition of the metabolic syndrome (4) and gout\nstatus.\nAssessment of metabolic syndrome. We used both the\nrevised and original National Cholesterol Education Pro-\ngram Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria to\ndefine the metabolic syndrome. According to the original\nNCEP/ATP III criteria (4,15), participants with 3 of the\nfollowing criteria were defined as having metabolic syn-\ndrome: abdominal obesity (waist circumference 102 cm\nin men and 88 cm in women), hypertriglyceridemia\npoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (40 mg/dl [1.04 mmoles/\nwomen), high blood pressure (130/85 mm Hg), and high\nfasting glucose (110 mg/dl [6.1 mmoles/liter]). We\ncounted participants who reported currently using antihy-\npertensive or antidiabetic medication (insulin or oral\nagents) as participants with high blood pressure or diabe-\ntes, respectively (4). Because the original NCEP/ATP III\ncriteria have recently been revised to require a lower fast-\ning glucose level (i.e., 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmoles/liter])\n(1,16), we report results obtained using the original criteria\nas well as those obtained using the revised criteria in this\nstudy. Serum triglycerides were measured enzymatically\nafter hydrolyzation to glycerol (Hitachi 704 Analyzer; Hi-\ntachi, Tokyo, Japan). HDL cholesterol was measured fol-\nlowing the precipitation of other lipoproteins with a hep-\narin-manganese chloride mixture (Hitachi 704 Analyzer)\n(17). Serum glucose concentration was measured using an\nenzymatic reaction (Cobas Mira assay; Roche, Basel, Swit-\nzerland). Details about the laboratory procedures of all of\nthese tests are published elsewhere (17). Three blood pres-\nsure readings were obtained in the mobile examination\ncenter. The average of the second and third systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure readings was used in the analyses.\nAssessment of gout. During the home interview, all sub-\njects were asked, \"Has a doctor ever told you that you had\ngout?\" Interviewers were instructed to emphasize the\nword doctor. If the respondent stated that it was another\nhealth professional who gave this diagnosis of gout, then\nthe answer was coded as no.\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using survey commands of STATA, version 9\n(StataCorp, College Station, TX) to incorporate sample\nweights and adjust for clusters and strata of the complex\nsample design. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was cal-\nculated according to the presence of gout. We performed\nlogistic regression to evaluate the association between\npresence of gout and presence of metabolic syndrome and\ncalculated unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and age- and sex-\nadjusted ORs. We also stratified the results by major asso-\nciated factors of gout including body mass index (BMI)\ntension (high blood pressure as defined above or antihy-\npertensive medication use), and diabetes (by self report of\na physician diagnosis or fasting glucose 126 mg/dl\n[6.99 mmoles/liter]). For all measures, we calculated\n95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All P values are\nRESULTS\nwhite, and the mean BMI was 26.4 kg/m2.

The prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome among individuals with gout did not appear to\ndiffer substantially between men and women. The preva-\nlence increased from 27% among participants with gout\nof age (Table 1). Application of the age-specific prevalence\nrates to US census counts from 2002 indicated that of the\n5.9 million US adults with a history of gout, 3.5 million\nUS adults have metabolic syndrome according to the re-\nvised NCEP/ATP criteria (1,16).\nPrevalences of individual metabolic abnormalities ac-\ncording to the presence of gout are summarized in Table 2.\nThe prevalence ranged from 33.1% for fasting glucose\nhigh blood pressure or antihypertensive medication use.\nAll prevalence rates of individual metabolic abnormalities\nwere substantially higher among persons with gout than\nthose without gout. All OR estimates for the association\nbetween gout and each metabolic component were statis-\ntically significant except for the age- and sex-adjusted ORs\nfor the more lenient insulin resistance criterion that re-\nquired a fasting glucose level 100 mg/dl (Table 2).\nWe stratified the prevalence of metabolic syndrome by\nmajor associated factors of gout (i.e., BMI, hypertension,\nand diabetes) (Table 3). As expected, the prevalence of\nmetabolic syndrome was higher when these stratified fac-\ntors were present. However, all stratified prevalence rates\nremained substantially and significantly higher among in-\ndividuals with gout than those without gout.

Compared with adults without gout,\nthe prevalence was nearly 3 times higher among those\nwith gout. The prevalence of individual metabolic abnor-\nmalities was higher among persons with gout, and the link\npersisted across the different subgroups stratified by BMI,\nhypertension, and diabetes. Although these associations\nhave been suspected, this is the first population-based\nstudy to demonstrate the strong association and quantify\nthe high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among indi-\nviduals with gout.\nThese data indicate that the prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome is very high among individuals with gout. In\nfact, the prevalence is substantially higher than among\nthose who experienced myocardial infarction or stroke\nexpand on previous studies that demonstrated a close\nrelationship between hyperuricemia and insulin resis-\ntance syndrome (6,9,10), and on the recent case series of\ngout and metabolic syndrome (12,13), thereby supporting\na pathogenetic overlap between these conditions. Higher\ninsulin levels are known to reduce renal excretion of urate\nthe renal excretion of urate in both healthy and hyperten-\nsive subjects (6,19,20). Insulin may enhance renal urate\nreabsorption via stimulation of urate-anion exchanger\nURAT1 (22) and/or the Na-dependent anion cotrans-\nporter in brush border membranes of the renal proximal\ntubule (8). Additionally, because serum levels of leptin\nand urate tend to increase together (23,24), some investi-\ngators have suggested that leptin may affect renal reabsorp-\ntion (8). Finally, in insulin resistance syndrome, impaired\noxidative phosphorylation may increase systemic adeno-\nsine concentrations by increasing the intracellular levels\nof coenzyme A esters of long-chain fatty acids (8). In-\ncreased adenosine, in turn, can result in renal retention of\nsodium, urate, and water (25\u00ad28). Some researchers have\nspeculated that chronically increased extracellular adeno-\nsine concentrations may also contribute to hyperuricemia\nby increasing urate production (25).\nThere are several important clinical implications of our\nresults. First, a diagnosis of gout should trigger a high\nclinical suspicion and investigation for a potential coex-\nistence of metabolic syndrome. If present, the syndrome\nneeds to be recognized as a potentially more life-threaten-\ning factor than gout or hyperuricemia (6) given the serious\nassociated complications (1\u00ad4). The cornerstones of treat-\nment for the syndrome are the management of weight and\nensuring appropriate levels of physical activity (4). Recent\nstudies demonstrated that dietary modification and en-\nhanced physical activity may delay or prevent the transi-\ntion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes\nmellitus and may provide relevant treatment paradigms\nLong-term dietary recommendations for the majority of\npatients with gout should take into account this frequent\ncomorbidity. For example, conventional dietary recom-\nmendations for gout have focused on restriction of purine\nintake, although low-purine diets are often high in carbo-\nhydrate and saturated fat (7). These macronutrients are\nassociated with an increased risk of insulin resistance\nFurthermore, these macronutrients tend to lead to higher\nserum insulin levels, which are known to reduce renal\nserum uric acid level and the risk of gout. Given the\nfrequent association between gout and metabolic syn-\ndrome, it is imperative to develop appropriate dietary and\nother lifestyle guidelines, taking into account risk of gouty\nattacks as well as overall long-term health effects. Our data\nalso provide support for the value of the strategic choice of\ncertain therapies for patients with gout and metabolic syn-\ndrome or its individual components (8). For example, the\nuricosuric property of fenofibrate (34) may be associated\nwith a favorable risk-benefit ratio among patients with\ngout and metabolic syndrome (8). Similarly, antihyperten-\nsive agents with uricosuric properties (e.g., losartan [34] or\namlodipine [35]) could have a better risk-benefit ratio than\ndiuretics for hypertension in hypertensive patients with\ngout (8). In addition, the growing epidemic of obesity\nchallenge in the prevention and management of gout (8).\nBecause these conditions would likely also share impor-\ntant parts of public health and clinical management ap-\nproaches, future studies may need to focus on developing\nthe overall optimal strategies for improving these concur-\nrent conditions.\nHyperuricemia is associated with cardiovascular disor-\nders (CVD), but whether it is an independent risk factor\nwith a pathogenic role in CVD or only a marker for asso-\nciated CVD risk factors, such as insulin resistance, obesity,\ndiuretic use, hypertension, and renal disease, is unclear\n(39,40). Although a number of studies have investigated\nthe relationship between serum urate levels and CVD,\nlittle information is available regarding the relationship\nbetween gout and cardiovascular outcomes. The Framing-\nham Study reported that gout was associated with a 60%\nincreased risk of coronary artery disease in men (41), and\nwe are not aware of any other prospective data on this\nimportant topic. The remarkably high prevalence of met-\nabolic syndrome observed in our study suggests that indi-\nviduals with gout are likely at increased risk for athero-\nsclerotic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (1,2),\nthe known complications of metabolic syndrome. Addi-\ntional prospective data on these important outcomes\nwould be valuable.\nStrengths and limitations of our study deserve comment.\nThis study was performed in a nationally representative\nsample of US men and women; therefore, the findings are\nlikely to be generalizable to US men and women. The\nself-reported diagnosis of gout by a physician was not\nvalidated in this study. However, it is unlikely that mis-\nclassification of the diagnosis would explain the strong\nassociations observed in this population study. It remains\nconceivable that the results may even be more striking\nwith more specific case definitions of gout, as was the case\nin our prospective epidemiologic study of gout for sus-\npected associated factors (42,43). Nonetheless, confirming\nthese results using such specific case definitions of gout\nGout and the Metabolic Syndrome 113\nwould be valuable. The current study provides national\nestimates of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among\nindividuals with gout and the magnitude of the cross-\nsectional association between the 2 conditions, which was\nwell served by the NHANES study design. Potential tem-\nporal relationships between these disorders should be ad-\ndressed by longitudinal studies.\nIn conclusion, these findings from a nationally represen-\ntative sample of US adults indicate that the prevalence of\nmetabolic syndrome is remarkably high among individu-\nals with gout. Given the serious complications associated\nwith metabolic syndrome, this frequent comorbidity\nshould be recognized and be taken into account in the\nlong-term treatment and overall health of individuals with\ngout.\nDr. Choi had full access to all of the data in the study and takes\nresponsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the\ndata analysis.\nStudy design.
