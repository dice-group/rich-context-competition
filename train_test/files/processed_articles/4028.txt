All\npatients provided written informed consent\nprior to participation. The study was\napproved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of Beijing Military General Hospital.\nPatients were admitted to hospital within\n7 days of symptom onset. All hospitalized\npatients with acute cerebral infarction met\nthe diagnostic criteria of the 4th Chinese\nCerebrovascular Diseases Conference\n(1995). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nexamination was performed before or within\n5 days after admission, using a Signa 1.5 T\n(GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK)\nsuperconducting system. T1-weighted,\nT2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion\nrecovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted\nimaging sequences were obtained.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging confirmed vis-\nible fresh infarction lesions in all enrolled\npatients.\nWithin 5 days after hospital admission,\nMRI FLAIR images were examined by two\nindependent neurologists (W.W. and J-J.G.)\nwho were unfamiliar with the patient's clin-\nical condition. Using the Fazekas method,\nbrain WMH was rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild),\n2 (moderate) or 3 (severe).\nEach patient's scores on the National\nInstitutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)\nfor neurological impairment were evaluated\non days 1, 7 and 14 after admission and on\nthe day of discharge. Each patient was also\nevaluated for the degree of disability or\ndependence in their daily activities using the\nmodified Rankin scale (mRS) on the day of\ndischarge; each patient was recorded as\nhaving either self-care capability (mRS 2)\nor self-care incapability (mRS !3).\nAfter admission, all patients received\nstandardized treatment regimens based on\nthe Chinese guidelines for cerebrovascular\ndisease prevention and treatment for\nAll clinical investigations were conducted\naccording to the principles of the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 13.0 (SPSS\u00d5, Chicago,\nIL, USA). All quantitative values were\nexpressed as mean \u00c6 SD. Because patients'\nNIHSS scores were not normally distribu-\nted, the Kruskal\u00adWallis method for non-\nparametric testing was used to analyse the\nassociations between WMH grade and\nneurological function. 2-test or Fisher's\nexact test were used to analyse differences\nbetween groups in risk-factor frequencies.\nStudent's t-test was used to analyse differ-\nences between groups in quantitative vari-\nables. Unconditional logistic analyses were\nperformed to investigate risk factors asso-\nciated with clinical outcome; patients' living\nskills (measured as the mRS score), age, sex,\nWMH grade, admission NIHSS score and\nimprovement in NIHSS score were included\nas independent variables. A P-value of\n<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical\nsignificance.\nResults\npatients (20.79%). No significant correl-\nations between NIHSS score and brain\nwhite matter change were found in patients\nwith different WMH grades on days 1, 7 and\n14 after admission or on the day of discharge\n(Table 1).\nThe NIHSS score improvements between\nbaseline (before admission) and 7 days after\nadmission (P \u00bc 0.024) and between baseline\nand discharge (P \u00bc 0.021) were negatively\nassociated with WMH grade. The NIHSS\nscore improvements between baseline and 14\ndays after admission showed a similar trend,\nbut the P-value was slightly higher\nthat the NIHSS score improvement between\ndifferent timepoints after admission in the\ngroup with a WMH grade of 3 was smaller\nthan that in the group with a WMH grade of\nAt the time of discharge, stroke patients\nwho had severe leucoaraiosis on admission\nTable 1.

The mor-\ntality rate tended to increase with increasing\nWMH grade, but no significant difference\nwas observed (Table 2).\nResults of the logistic regression analysis\nshowed that the NIHSS score on the day of\nWMH grade on the day of admission (OR\nent factors predicting the patient's self-care\nincapability on the day of discharge.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study we found that elderly\nstroke patients with severe leucoaraiosis at\nthe time of admission (WMH grade !2) had\na high probability of self-care incapability\nafter treatment (P < 0.05). The NIHSS score\nimprovement was also negatively associated\nwith the patients' leucoaraiosis severity\n(P < 0.05). Mortality tended to increase\nwith WMH grade, but not significantly.\nThus, we suggest that severe leucoaraiosis\nwas associated with poor prognosis in eld-\nerly stroke patients.\nLeucoaraiosis is an independent predic-\ntion factor for stroke.2,11 After the first\ninfarct, patients with severe leucoaraiosis\nhad a higher risk of recurrence of stroke\nthan those without leucoaraiosis or with\nmild leucoaraiosis.2,11 However, few studies\nhave focused on the association between\nbrain leucoaraiosis and prognosis in stroke\npatients; results are inconclusive.12 Thus, we\nsuggest that severe leucoaraiosis is asso-\nciated with poor prognosis in elderly stroke\npatients. Furthermore, the NIHSS score and\nWMH grade on the day of admission were\nindependent risk factors for clinical outcome\nin elderly stroke patients.\nAmong patients with transient ischaemic\nattack and lacunar infarction, the stroke\nrecurrence rate in those with leucoaraiosis\nwas 60% higher than in those without\nleucoaraiosis.13 Leucoaraiosis is known to\nbe associated with cognitive impairment,14\ngait and balance impairment,15 mood\nchanges and depression, urinary incontin-\nence, decline in daily living capability16 and\nother clinical manifestations. Podgorska\nstroke and analysed the association between\npatient prognosis and leucoaraiosis severity.\nThey found that the 1-year mortality rate\nwas significantly higher in patients with, than\nin those without, leucoaraiosis.12 However,\nno significant difference in mortality was\nobserved 30 days after clinical onset.12\nIn the present study, no significant dif-\nference was observed in mortality in patients\nwith or without leucoaraiosis during the\nperiod of hospitalization. These results are\nconsistent with those of Podgorska et al.12\nHowever, in the present study stroke\npatients with leucoaraiosis had a higher\nTable 2.

Studies have shown that leucoar-\naiosis volume is an independent predictor of\ninfarct size in stroke patients.17 This is\nprobably one reason why acute infarction\npatients who also have leucoaraiosis have a\npoor prognosis. In addition, patients with\nsevere leucoaraiosis often also have cerebro-\nvascular disease and cognitive dysfunction,\nwhich may affect functional recovery.18 It\nhas been shown that long-term mortality\nand the incidence of pneumonia are greater\nin neurology outpatients who have leucoar-\naiosis than in those without leucoaraiosis.19\nFurthermore, patients with leucoaraiosis are\nsusceptible to lung and urinary tract infec-\ntions, which might also be linked to their\nIn conclusion, Chinese elderly patients\nwith acute infarction and severe leucoaraio-\nsis had a poorer prognosis than those with-\nout leucoaraiosis or with minor\nleucoaraiosis, in the present study.
