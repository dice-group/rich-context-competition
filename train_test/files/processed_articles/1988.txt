Over\ntime, the prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) may increase due to the ex-\npanding size of the diabetes population or decrease due to the implementation of dia-\nbetes therapies.\nObjective To define temporal changes in DKD prevalence in the United States.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analyses of the Third National\nwith diabetes were defined by levels of hemoglobin A1c\nof 6.5% or greater, use of\nMain Outcome Measures Diabetic kidney disease was defined as diabetes with\nalbuminuria (ratio of urine albumin to creatinine 30 mg/g), impaired glomerular fil-\ntration rate (60 mL/min/1.73 m2 estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi-\ndemiology Collaboration formula), or both. Prevalence of albuminuria was adjusted\nto estimate persistent albuminuria.\nResults The prevalence of DKD in the US population was 2.2% (95% confidence\ntrend). The prevalence of DKD increased in direct proportion to the prevalence of dia-\nbetes, without a change in the prevalence of DKD among those with diabetes. Among\npersons with diabetes, use of glucose-lowering medications increased from 56.2% (95%\n2008 (P.001); use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors increased from\n(P.001); the prevalence of impaired glomerular filtration rate increased from 14.9%\nConclusions Prevalence of DKD in the United States increased from 1988 to\n2008 in proportion to the prevalence of diabetes.

Each NHANES\noversamples persons of black race, His-\npanic ethnicity, or both. The current\nstudy includes participants in NHANES\nolder, underwent a health examina-\ntion in the NHANES mobile examina-\ntion center, and had available data for\nmedication use, levels of hemoglobin\n, serum creatinine concentrations,\nand urine albumin and creatinine\nconcentrations.\nAll NHANES protocols were ap-\nproved by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics Research ethics re-\nview board (previously known as the\nNHANES institutional review board);\nall participants provided written in-\nDiabetes Definition\nDiabetes was defined as use of glucose-\nlowering medications (insulin or oral\nhypoglycemic medications), level of he-\nmoglobin A1c\nof 6.5% or greater, or\nboth.2,8 Level of hemoglobin A1c\nor greater was recently recommended\nfor diagnosis of diabetes by a broadly\nrepresentativeinternationalexpertcom-\nmittee and by the American Diabetes\nAssociation and is used in this study in-\nstead of fasting or postchallenge glu-\ncose to include NHANES participants\nwho were not fasting or did not re-\nceive an oral glucose tolerance test.2,17\nLevel of hemoglobin A1c\nwas mea-\nsured during all of the NHANES cycles\nusing high-pressure liquid chromatog-\nraphy (coefficients of variation\nized to the Diabetes Control and Com-\nplications Trial laboratory. To ac-\ncount for change in hemoglobin A1c\nassay location and platform, hemoglo-\n2008 were calibrated to values from ear-\nlier NHANES cycles using the equation:\nuse self-reported history of diabetes to\ndefine diabetes to avoid bias by tem-\nporal changes in diabetes case defini-\ntion and ascertainment.\nDKD Definition\nDiabetic kidney disease was defined as\ndiabetes with the presence of albumin-\nuria, impaired GFR, or both.1,2 In each\nNHANES cycle, urine albumin and cre-\natinine concentrations were measured\nin a random single-voided urine sample\nusing a solid-phase fluorescent immu-\nnoassay and a Jaffe rate reaction, re-\nspectively. The ratio of urine albumin\nto creatinine was expressed in milli-\ngrams per gram with albuminuria de-\nfined as a level of 30 mg/g or greater.1,2\nAlbuminuria is well-known to have\nsubstantial biological (intraindi-\nvidual) variation, and current guide-\nlines recommend that only persistent\nalbuminuria be considered evidence of\nDKD.1,2 Therefore, we used data from\n45 participants with diabetes in\nNHANES III, ratio of urine albumin to\ncreatinine of 30 mg/g or greater at their\nmain examination, and a repeat urine\nsample approximately 2 weeks later to\nestimate the prevalence of persistent al-\nbuminuria from a single urine sample.16\nsistent albuminuria (78%).\nSerum creatinine concentrations\nwere measured using the kinetic Jaffe\nrate method. Values from NHANES III\nbrated as previously described to ac-\ncount for laboratory drift in serum cre-\natinine concentrations across NHANES\nfrom calibrated serum creatinine con-\ncentrations using the Chronic Kidney\nDisease Epidemiology Collaboration\nequation.21 Impaired GFR was defined\nOther Clinical Characteristics\nAge, sex, race/ethnicity, and duration\nof diabetes were assessed by question-\nnaire.16 Type 1 diabetes was defined for\ndescriptive purposes only using the fol-\nlowing criteria: (1) diagnosis prior to\nage 30 years; (2) first insulin use within\n2 years of diabetes diagnosis (allow-\ning for reporting error); and (3) cur-\nrent insulin use. Medications taken dur-\ning a 1-month period preceding the\nNHANES physical examination were\nassessed by in-person interview.16 Body\nmass index was calculated as weight in\nkilograms divided by height in meters\nsquared. Three or more consecutive\nblood pressure measurements sepa-\nrated by 30 seconds were made after 5\nminutes of rest, with mean values used\nfor analysis.\nStatistical Methods\nAll statistical analyses were per-\nformed using Stata version 11.1 (Stata-\nCorp, College Station, Texas) and in-\ncorporated recommended NHANES\nweights to account for nonresponse bias\nand sampling.16 For each of NHANES\nlence of DKD in the US population and\nthe distributions of clinical character-\nistics among the diabetes subpopula-\ntion using Stata's svy commands.\nDiabetic kidney disease was evalu-\nated in 4 mutually exclusive catego-\nries based on the presence or absence\nof albuminuria and impaired GFR. To\nestimate the prevalence of persistent al-\nbuminuria (78% of persons with ratio\nof urine albumin to creatinine 30 mg/\ng), 22% of participants with albumin-\nuria alone were reclassified as having\nno DKD and 22% of participants with\nalbuminuria and impaired GFR were re-\nclassified as having only impaired GFR.\nWealsoevaluatedimpairedGFR,per-\nsistent albuminuria, and any DKD as\nparallel outcomes. To estimate persis-\ntent albuminuria, we multiplied the\nprevalence of elevated ratio of urine al-\nbumin to creatinine by the estimated\nprobabilityofpersistence(0.78)andcal-\nculated corresponding 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) for the product.22 We es-\ntimated prevalence of any DKD as the\nsum of (1) the prevalence of impaired\nGFR and (2) the prevalence of normal\nGFR and elevated ratio of urine albu-\nmintocreatininemultipliedbytheprob-\nabilityofpersistence.Wederivedanana-\nTable 1.

Among persons with diabetes,\nuse of glucose-lowering medications\nand RAAS inhibitors increased mark-\nedly but there was no change in\nthe prevalence of DKD. Specific clini-\ncal manifestations of DKD shifted\nwith an increased prevalence of\nimpaired GFR.\nThe increasing prevalence of DKD\nunderscores its public health impact.\nDiabetes is the most common cause\nof chronic kidney disease, and DKD\nis the most common cause of ESRD\nin the United States.

There-\nfore, it also is possible that implemen-\ntation of diabetes treatments requires\nmore time to demonstrate benefit, or\nthat current diabetes therapies are fail-\ning to prevent decrease in GFR when\napplied on the population level.\nNotably, most therapies targeting\nDKD have been developed while focus-\ning on albuminuria reduction, poten-\ntially selecting for interventions that re-\nduce albuminuria more than they\npreserve GFR.30 Our results suggest that\nadditional interventions are needed to\nprevent the development of diabetes\nand to target GFR loss once diabetes is\ndiagnosed.\nCharacteristics of the diabetes popu-\nlation also may have changed in a man-\nTable 4.

Stable age\nand sex distributions in the diabetes\npopulation and multivariable model-\ning demonstrated that lack of decline\nin DKD prevalence is not due to demo-\ngraphic changes. Self-reported dura-\ntion of diabetes increased over time, and\nlonger disease duration could counter-\nbalance concurrent changes favoring\nreduced DKD prevalence. Because dia-\nbetes diagnostic criteria and ascertain-\nment changed during the study pe-\nriod,thispossibilitycannotbeexcluded.\nThe diabetic population became more\nobese over the study period, and obe-\nsity is known to increase the risks of de-\nveloping albuminuria and impaired\nwas stable, accounting for changes in\nbody mass index.\nDiabetic kidney disease was ini-\ntially characterized as a disease mani-\nfesting as albuminuria followed by de-\nof studies demonstrated that impaired\nGFR can occur without substantial al-\nbuminuria and that DKD can manifest\nsuggests that the clinical pattern of DKD\nmay be shifting over time, with more\nimpaired GFR and the possibility of de-\ncreased albuminuria, which could be\ndue to changes in diabetes treatment.\nRenal pathology underlying this shift\nand long-term implications of this shift\non cardiovascular complications and\nESRD remain to be determined. The in-\ncreasingly frequent manifestation of im-\npaired GFR (at least relative to albu-\nminuria) supports current guidelines\nrecommending screening for GFR in\naddition to albuminuria.1,2\nStrengths of this study include the\nuse of data with broad external valid-\nity, assessment of temporal trends over\n20 years during which diabetes treat-\nment changed substantially, examina-\ntion of complementary albuminuria and\nGFR manifestations of DKD, and use\nof conservative and temporally unbi-\nased definitions of diabetes and DKD.\nThis study also has limitations.\nNHANES does not include institu-\ntionalized persons, and persons who\nare ill with advanced DKD may be\nunderrepresented. Despite careful\neffects to minimize assay drift, this\nmay still affect the study results. Spe-\ncifically, mean serum creatinine con-\ncentration was noted to increase over\ntime among young, healthy NHANES\nparticipants (different participants at\neach cycle), suggesting that a subtle\nartificial decline in mean estimated\nGFR may persist despite calibration;\nmeasurement of urine albumin and\ncreatinine also is not standardized.20\nAbsolute estimates of persistent albu-\nminuria prevalence were based in\npart on repeat measurements in a\nsmall group of NHANES III partici-\npants. This introduces uncertainty in\nalbuminuria prevalence estimates (as\nreflected in the reported 95% CIs)\nbut probably does not bias the analy-\nsis of temporal trends.\nIn conclusion, DKD has become\nmore prevalent in the US population\nover the last 2 decades and will likely\ncontribute increasingly to health care\ncosts and mortality. Among persons\nwith diabetes, clinical manifestations\nof DKD shifted to include more\nimpaired GFR but the prevalence of\nany DKD did not change despite\nincreased use of diabetes-related\nmedications.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr de Boer had full access to\nall of the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: de Boer, Himmelfarb.\nAcquisition of data: de Boer, Rue.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: de Boer, Rue, Hall,\nHeagerty, Weiss, Himmelfarb.\nDrafting of the manuscript: de Boer, Hall, Himmelfarb.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: de Boer, Rue, Hall, Heagerty, Weiss,\nHimmelfarb.\nStatistical analysis: Rue, Hall, Heagerty.\nObtained funding: de Boer.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: de Boer,\nHimmelfarb.\nStudy supervision: de Boer, Weiss.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have com-\npleted and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure\nof Potential Conflicts of Interest.
