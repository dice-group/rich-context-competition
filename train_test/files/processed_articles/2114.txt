In addition, peak cadence, a simple indicator\nof best natural ambulatory effort, can be captured. Such indicators have been used to study adult ambulatory behavior in a representative\nsample, but similar analyses for children and adolescents are limited to a single small and select sample. Purpose: The study's purpose\nwas to describe in children and adolescents 1) free-living cadence patterns (i.e., time spent at incrementally higher cadence bands) and 2)\npeak cadence indicators (i.e., peak 60 min, peak 30 min, and peak 1 min) by sex, age, and body mass index. Methods: Cadence patterns\nand peak cadence were derived from 2005\u00ad2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey accelerometer data represent-\nand 16\u00ad19 yr), and body mass index\u00addefined weight status (normal, overweight, obese).

The National Center for Health Statistics\nethics review board approved all NHANES protocols, and\nall participants were asked to provide informed consent.\nParental/guardian consent was obtained for minors. As in\nprevious research that described steps per day in children\none valid day of accelerometer data (defined later), and had\ncomplete height and weight data were included in these\nanalyses. BMI was transformed into the following categories:\nnormal weight, overweight, and obese on the basis of sex- and\nage-specific cutpoints for children and adolescents (7).\nInstruments. The NHANES is designed to assess the\nhealth and nutrition status of adults and children in the United\nGraph model 7164 accelerometer (formerly the CSA/MTI\nAM-7164, manufactured by ActiGraph of Fort Walton Beach,\nFL) to assess step-defined physical activity (as well as other\nufacturer, has been well described previously (9). Briefly, it\nused a single-axis accelerometer designed to measure vertical\naccelerations while worn at the hip. The output frequency was\n0.25 to 2.5 Hz, digitized by an analog-to-digital converter,\nand stored in 1-min intervals. Step data are not available from\nerometer data.\nProcedures. NHANES participants who were at least\n6 yr and not limited in their ability to walk or otherwise wear\nan accelerometer were recruited to wear it for seven con-\nsecutive days during all waking hours (removing it at night\nand for any water activities, including showering). Height and\nweight were measured using standard procedures. Additional\ninformation about all measurements, including more details\nabout the accelerometer protocol, can be found at http://\nwww.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/BM.pdf.\nData treatment and analysis. A SAS macro (http://\nriskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/) supplied by the\nNational Cancer Institute was used to determine nonwear\ntime (defined as Q60 consecutive zeros, allowing minimal\ninterruptions). To keep consistent with previous analyses of\nthese data, a valid day was defined as having at least 10 h of\naccelerometer wear time and at least one valid day of data,\nwhich was shown to eliminate bias due to more active par-\nticipants wearing the accelerometer for more days (28).\nAdhering closely to procedures published describing ca-\ndence patterns in adults (25), cadence was extracted from the\ndata without any manipulation (e.g., censoring below any\nspecific activity count cutpoint [28]) because our objective\nwas to present the full range of cadence as detected by the\ninstrument. Cadences were then organized into bands of\nThe amount of time (minIdj1) and steps per day accumu-\nlated within each cadence band were computed, as well as\nthe time spent at zero steps per minute (excluding nonwear\ntime). In addition, the peak 60-min, peak 30-min, and peak\n1-min cadences were computed by rank ordering the data for\neach day for each participant and then averaging steps per\nminute accumulated over the top 60, 30, and 1 min (as ap-\npropriate) across valid days.\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Insti-\ntute, Cary, NC) sample survey procedures to account for the\ncomplex NHANES sampling design. The SURVEYREG\nprocedure followed by pairwise contrast analysis was used\nto compare cadence bands and peak cadence values between\nage, sex, and BMI groups. We set the > level at 0.001 to\nconservatively interpret significance amidst multiple com-\nparisons in this large sample. To ensure national represen-\ntativeness of results, sample weights were used to account\nfor oversampling and nonresponse.\nRESULTS\nThe total minutes of wear time for the overall sample and\nby sex are presented in Table 1.

Be-\ncause we know of no other study of free-living cadence in\nchildren or adolescents in representative samples at this time,\nthese analyses extend the adult findings. For all age groups\nand for both sexes, the majority of time (mean = 10.5 hIdj1)\nis spent at zero cadence or accumulating 1\u00ad19 steps per\nminute during the monitored day (mean = 13.7 hIdj1). Thus,\non average, 3.2 hIdj1 is spent in cadence bands accumulat-\ning 20 or more steps per minute and only a relatively small\namount of time (G3 min) is spent at a cadence Q120 steps\nper minute. However, US children and adolescents do av-\nerage approximately 50 minIdj1 taking 60 or more steps per\nminute, a cadence range indicative of purposeful and incre-\nmentally higher intensity ambulatory activities (25,26).\nTo facilitate comparison, the previously collected adult\ndata (25) are displayed alongside the data for children and\nFigure 2. Also, as previously described, this sample of US\nchildren and adolescents averaged approximately 13,000\n(boys) and 12,000 (girls) accelerometer-determined steps\nper day (28), considerably more than the US adults who av-\neraged approximately 9600 steps per day (27). Despite appar-\nent differences in volume of steps per day, when categorized\ninto incrementally higher cadence bands, the children's and\nadolescents' data display step accumulation patterns similar\nto adults. The most notable difference is that US children and\nadolescents average approximately 40 minIdj1 less at zero\ncadence (i.e., nonmovement) and approximately 30 minIdj1\nmore at cadences Q40 steps per minute than US adults.\nIn adolescents, short-distance gait tests of similarly age\nboys and girls demonstrate that girls self-select a higher\nFIGURE 1--The time (minIdj1) (A) and steps per day (B) accumulated\nwithin each cadence band for each sex\u00adage group. *Significantly different\nfrom girls; #significantly different from 12\u00ad15 age group; significantly\ndifferent from 16\u00ad19 age group of the same sex; significantly different\nTABLE 3.

These\nobjectively monitored NHANES data show that there were\nno statistically significant differences, however, between boys'\nand girls' free-living highest single minute or best 30 min of\nthe day, suggesting that these indicators are overall more a\nreflection of natural behavior than sex-associated height/leg\nlength differences. Table 2 reveals that, although there are\nno sex differences regarding time spent at cadences Q100\nsteps per minute, boys spent significantly more time at ca-\ndences between 20 and 99 steps per minute, and this is\nreflected by the significantly higher peak 60-min cadence in\nboys compared with girls. Compared with the shorter peak\ncadence indicators, the peak 60-min cadence will be more\naffected by the relative persistence of a behavior during a\nday. The observed sex difference in peak 60-min cadence\n(i.e., boys 9 girls) is consistent with what is known based on\nother physical activity measurement approaches (4).\nExtrapolating from these cross-sectional data, it seems\nthat as children age, they tend to spend increasingly more\ntime at zero cadence, shifting on average from 189.5 minIdj1\nage 6\u00ad11 yr also tend to spend more time and take more\nsteps per day at cadences G80 steps per minute than the 12-\ndifferences were found, the overall time spent and steps per\nwere similarly low (on average) for all the age groups\nhighlighting the need to enhance promotion of activities that\ncan elicit such cadences across the board.\nSimilar to the study by Bjornson et al. (5), which reported\nonly peak 1-min cadence, the older age groups analyzed\nherein had slightly lower values than the younger age\ngroups. As well, the peak 30-min and peak 1-min cadence\nvalues for the 16- to 19-yr-old adolescents were higher than\nthose previously reported for adults (peak 30 min = 63 steps\nper minute and peak 1 min = 91 steps per minute) (24). Al-\nthough differences between age groups could be attributed\nto development that occurs with age, the mechanical work\nand the muscular efficiency during walking for children\nQ10 yr are not different from adults when normalized to\nbody mass (21). During late adolescence, both boys and\ngirls are likely to have attained adult height (19). In addition,\nBeck et al. (2) tested children between 2 and 15 yr and\ndemonstrated that for an average speed of 1.04 mIsj1, the\nstride length was 76% of the child's height. With those\nresults in mind, it is possible to conclude that as children\nget older and taller, they can walk faster at a similar cadence\nrate or decrease cadence to walk at a similar speed. How-\never, the present study focuses on the description pattern of\nsex- and age-specific step accumulation and as an expres-\nsion of naturally occurring ambulatory behavior. Certainly,\nthe conclusions about time spent at zero cadence cannot be\ninfluenced by development or stride length, and, therefore,\nit more clearly represents a behavior.\nChildren and adolescents classified as obese had lower\nvalues for all peak cadence indicators than those classified\nas normal weight by BMI. Peak cadence is an indicator used\nto capture natural best-effort ambulatory activity expressed\nunder free-living conditions. As an average of the best min-\nutes of a day, it is shaped not only by its magnitude but also\nby the number of minutes considered. Even when considering\nonly the best single minute (where magnitude would matter\nmost), obese children and adolescents attain lower values\nthan their normal-weight peers. This free-living finding is\nconsistent with gait analyses studies that also show that obese\nchildren have lower cadences at all walking speeds (13,14).\nInterestingly, the NHANES data demonstrate that even over-\nweight children/adolescents had a higher peak 1-min cadence\nthan obese children/adolescents. There was no difference,\nhowever, in the peak 30-min or peak 60-min cadences. The\nlonger duration peak cadence indicators increasingly reflect\nthe persistence of the behavior. Overall, it seems that obese\nchildren/adolescents do not achieve cadences that are as\nhigh as those attained by either overweight or normal-weight\nchildren. However, neither overweight nor obese children\nsustain these cadences for accumulated durations when\ncompared with normal-weight children. This is an interesting\nnuance that we do not believe has been presented previously\nand thus requires additional investigation to illuminate un-\nderlying factors contributing to these BMI-defined behav-\nioral differences.\nAs previously stated, we know from short-distance\nwalking tests (8) that the expected cadence at self-selected\npreferred walking speed is 150 steps per minute for 6-yr-old\nchildren and 126 steps per minute for 10-yr-olds. However,\nin this representative sample of free-living US children and\nadolescents, only a relatively small portion of time was spent\nat comparable cadences. In addition, just a few minutes were\nspent taking Q120 steps per minute, which Graser et al. (11)\nsuggested to be associated with MVPA in 10- to 12-yr-old\nboys and girls. Unfortunately, there has been little research\nbeyond the study by Graser et al. that provides alternative\nage-specific values. We would expect the value to be higher\nFIGURE 2--The time (minIdj1) and steps per day accumulated within\neach cadence band for children and adolescents by age group (6\u00ad11,\nare from the study by Tudor-Locke et al.

The MVPA-associated cadence value for adults is\nQ100 steps per minute (26). Interpreted against the results of\ngait speed tests and this crude single-cadence threshold of-\nfered by Graser et al., our findings are consistent with the\nhypothesis that many US children and adolescents have\nrelatively few minutes in daily life when they engage in\nactivities that elicit step accumulation patterns indicative of\nnormal walking speeds, let alone those associated with\nMVPA. In all sex-by-age groups, the average peak cadences\nwere well below the 120 steps per minute associated with\npeak 60-min cadence above 120 steps per minute, and only\n22 were above 100 steps per minute. The average time\nabove 120+ steps per minute was only 2.5 min for the entire\nMany limitations in this study must be acknowledged.\nThis report is focused on ambulatory physical activity, and it\ndoes not fully capture the more complex activities that in-\nclude upper body movements (e.g., gymnastics, volleyball)\nor water activities like swimming that would also be con-\nsidered of at least moderate intensity. This is a descriptive\nstudy of step accumulation patterns of US children and\nadolescents. Additional analyses are planned to examine the\nassociation of cadence indicators with various health\nparameters. Whereas at higher cadences, the values repre-\nsent actual stepping rates for 1 min, at lower cadence bands,\nwe are representing a pattern of how steps are accumulated\nwithin a minute. It is not realistic to think that children and\nadolescents are walking in ``slow motion'' at a step rate of\nG40 steps per minute. The lower cadence steps were likely\naccumulated at a much faster rate and in a time interval\nshorter than 1 min. As intensity of activity increases and\nsustained durations are shortened, the effect will be larger.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to investigate bouts in a\nmore flexible manner because the 1-min data collection in-\nterval was preset. We acknowledge that dividing detected\nsteps by smaller time frame denominators suggests higher\nstepping rates; however, Tudor-Locke and Rowe (29) have\nrecently argued that ``the purpose of studying free-living\nminute-by-minute step accumulation patterns is to relay the\nexecution and relative persistence of naturally occurring\nambulatory behavior.'' Finally, these analyses represent\npopulation averages that minimize individual realities. For\nexample, if two children obtained peak 60-min cadence\nvalues of 120 steps per minute and a third child obtained 70\nsteps per minute, the ``sample'' average would be only 103\nsteps per minute. The few cases with very high peak cadence\nvalues are thus reduced by the very larger number of cases\nwith very low values.\nIn summary, this study provides descriptive data for US\nchildren and adolescents for time and steps per day accu-\nmulated within incrementally higher cadence bands and\npeak cadence indicators for 60, 30, and 1 min. These refer-\nence data are important and can be used for surveillance,\ntracking, comparison, screening, intervention, and evalua-\ntion purposes. On average and for all age groups and for\nboth sexes, the majority of time during the day is spent at the\nbands, and a very small amount of time (G3 minIdj1) is\nspent at cadences Q120 steps per minute. Although there are\nno sex differences with regards to time spent at cadences\nQ100 steps per minute, boys have a higher peak 60-min ca-\ndence than girls, reflecting their higher amounts of time\nspent at 20\u00ad99 steps per minute. A finding that bears re-\npeating is that, overall, children and adolescents seem to\nhave relatively few minutes in daily life in which they en-\ngage in activities that elicit step accumulation patterns\nindicative of normal walking speeds (derived from short-\ndistance gait tests), let alone those associated with MVPA.\nThe results also indicate that interventions to increase\nphysical activity and, in particular, opportunities for persis-\ntent brisk ambulation or faster types of locomotion are nec-\nessary at an early age for both boys and girls if they are to\nestablish and sustain habitual healthy ambulatory activity\nlevels before entering adulthood.\nThe authors thank Meghan Brashear for help with data manage-\nment and statistical analysis.\nThe authors did not receive funding for this project.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nThe results of the present study do not constitute endorsement\nby the American College of Sports Medicine.\nREFERENCES\n1.
