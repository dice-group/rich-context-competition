What are the\nmechanisms behind it? Are certain individuals with certain characteristics (i.e. cognitive\nability, overconfidence etc.) more affected?\nContribution\nMost previous studies on peer effects rely on observational data. This, however, makes\na clear identification of peer effects difficult. Measuring the extent to which peers affect\ndecision making is challenging because social group formation is usually endogenous,\nmeaning that observed peer effects may be due to individuals in a group being more\nsimilar than other individuals. This complicates causal inference. If belonging to a social\ngroup is a matter of deliberate choice, it is difficult to assign causality to the impact of\nthe group itself. We try to overcome this using a novel lab-in-a-field experiment. In the\nexperiment, we let respondents chose between a temptation good i.e. a combination of\nsweet and salty snacks and an increasing amount of money. In the control group every\nrespondent makes their own decision away from their peers, while in the treatment group\nrespondents still make their own decision, but do so while observing each other. This is\nthe first study that uses a lab-in-the-field experiment to study the impact of peer effects\non individual consumption choice.\nResults\nWe find that individual choices are influenced by peers if they perform the experiment in\nthe treatment group where they are able to observe their peers. In other words, we find\nconformity within a group as the standard deviation in groups that observe each other\nis lower. In further analysis we look into the possible mechanism behind this conformity.\nWe study the effect of familiarity with the product and find that peer observation can\ncounteract the effect of a lack of knowledge of a product. We also find evidence that\nrespondents follow the choices of their peer group. Finally, we investigate treatment\nheterogeneities. We find that individuals with high cognitive ability, are less likely to\nchoose the tasty treat, while the same effect is not to be found for overconfident or high-\nincome individuals. We also find evidence that those that live in closer knit communities\nare more likely to succumb to peer effects. Hence, we provide clear evidence of peer effects\nand conclude that peer observation leads to conformity.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nFragestellung\nVerhalten sich die Menschen anders, wenn sie von ihren Mitmenschen beobachtet werden?\nTreffen sie dann andere Konsumentscheidungen?

In traditional economic theory consumption choices are regarded as a function\nof budget, price and personal preferences. The effect of those around us is rarely consid-\nered. In this study we aim to change this and define peer effects as the simple effect that\nleads individuals to behave in a similar way to those around them.\nThe study of peer effects in consumption choices is not just crucial in advancing fur-\nther understanding of individual decision-making, but at a second look, can also have an\nimportant effect on policy. Peer effects may influence the success of cash transfer pro-\ngrams. If peer effects are prevalent they could have an effect on consumption decisions\ntaken with cash grants for instance. At the same time, policy makers who are interested\nin increasing the uptake of certain goods such as health services or innovative technology\ncould use peer effects in order to increase consumption of such goods.\nOne reason why economists have largely ignored peer effects on consumption choice\nis that identifying peer effects comes with a number of challenges. Measuring the extent\nto which peers affect decision making is challenging because social group formation is\nusually endogenous, meaning that observed peer effects may be due to individuals in a\ngroup being more similar than other individuals, and hence this complicates causal in-\nference. If belonging to a social group is a matter of deliberate choice, it is difficult to\nassign causality to the impact of the group itself (Manski, 1993). This effect is referred\nto as correlated effects. Furthermore, observed peer effects may be caused by unobserved\ntime-varying factors, also known as contextual effects, when individuals that are part\nof the same group also experience the same things. In addition, since individuals may\nmake simultaneous decisions affecting each other it becomes difficult to determine causal\nbehavior.\nTherefore, identifying peer effects from observational data is problematic. We solve\nthis problem by using a lab-in-the-field experiment to provide clear evidence of peer effects\non consumption choices in a fully controlled setting where no possible confounding factor\ncan hinder identification. To the best of our knowledge, no experiment of peer effects in\nconsumption decisions has been conducted so far. Our experimental setting allows us to\novercome the Manskian problem of contextual and correlated effects. Thus, we are able\nto isolate endogenous peer effects. In this paper, we aim to (i) identify and estimate the\nexistence of peer effects in terms of consumption decisions; (ii) investigate some mecha-\nnisms through which peer effects operate; and (iii) test whether there are differences in\nthe way certain people are affected by their peers.\nWe are able to control for a large number personal and local confounding factors\nbecause our experimental results can be complemented with a large household survey\ncontaining a wide-range of socio-economic information of the respondents and the village\nin which they live. We perform the experiment in rural Thailand because of the prevalence\nof close-knit communities. Our respondents live in relatively small villages and have often\nlived there for many generations. In other words, even though assignment to a group is\nrandom; groups are made up of people that actually know each other (Mangyo and Park,\n2011). Hence our experiment provides more external validity than other experiments that\nare performed with complete strangers.\nThe design of our experiment is straightforward: we test consumption choices by sim-\nply offering respondents the choice between a combination of sweet and salty snacks, i.e.\nthe temptation good1 (called the tasty treat or TT from here on) and money. The amount\nof money offered increases by ten Baht in every round whereas the tasty treat stays the\nsame. In the control group, respondents have to make their consumption choices on their\nown, separated from the rest of the respondents. In the treatment group, each respondent\nstill makes his/her own decision, but all respondents observe each other. Hence, the only\ndifference between treatment and control group is peer observation and so any difference\nin outcome can be attributed to peer observation.\nOur experimental study has a number of advantages that enable us to tackle the prob-\nlems described by Manski (1993, 2000). We are able to solve the problem of correlated\neffects by randomizing the village in which the experiment is performed under peer obser-\nvation. Given our large sample size, we assume that our villages are the same on average\n1Temptation goods are defined as goods that provide the current self with positive utility, but negative\nutility to any future self, for instance alcohol, cigarettes or unhealthy foods (Banerjee and Mullainathan,\nand that effects can simply be attributed to peer observation. In addition we have very\ndetailed information about the individual, their household and the village in which they\nlive. Randomization of our sample in observing and non-observing groups on the village\nlevel combined with detailed information about village and household characteristics cir-\ncumvents the problem of correlated effects. In addition, as we perform an experiment that\nlasts a short time in a relatively controlled environment, we are able to avoid problems\ncaused by contextual or time-variant unobservables that affect all group members. Thus,\nour research design enables us to directly identify peer effects by comparing outcomes\nfor those groups that performed the experiment with and without peer observation. In\norder to identify endogenous peer effects, we use the model of endogenous peer effects\nwith leave-out mean in which individuals average consumption is regressed on the mean\nof the group ? excluding the individual himself (Angrist, 2014).\nWe focus in particular on the effect of peer's observation on temptation goods, since\nconsumption choices for temptation goods are particularly susceptible to the influence of\npeer effects, as has been shown, especially for young people in social psychology (Gunter\nand Furnham, 1998; Steinberg and Cauffman, 1996). Another reason for choosing temp-\ntation goods was that there are no real economic or welfare needs for the temptation\ngoods that are offered. The idea behind this is that playing the game with goods that\nare necessities may have confounding effects on the demand for the good compared to the\nmoney offered.\nIn order to support our experimental analysis, we develop a theoretical framework. We\nadjust a standard model of consumer choice with a cost imposed on the decision maker\nwhen deviating from the group choice. We argue that this cost represents a social cost \u00ad\narising from not conforming to the group. We can show using this model that under the\npeer treatment extreme choices are more costly and therefore, the demand curve for the\ntasty treat is flatter. This makes extreme choices less likely.\nOur experimental data confirms the prediction of the model. Specifically, we find that\nobserving groups - those that sit in close proximity with each other - have a higher group\nminimum and a lower group maximum. Consequentially, the standard deviation for ob-\nserving groups is lower than for those groups that simply played at the same time, but\nwithout peer observation.\nIn further analysis, we confirm this finding by showing that the group average, exclud-\ning the individual him/herself, has a positive and significant influence on the decisions\nmade by the individual respondent, however, only when the experiment is performed with\npeer observation. Most importantly, the effect is not significant when the experiment is\nperformed in non-observing groups. The effect being only present in the observing groups\nshows us that it can be attributed to the presence of peers and not to other possible\neffects.\nNext, we aim to explore the mechanisms behind the peer effect. There are two possible\nreasons for this; either the respondents feel that the others in a group have better infor-\nmation or they are gaining some kind of psychological benefit from conforming to others.\nWe find evidence that unfamiliarity with a product is counteracted by peer observations,\nindicating some evidence for the first mechanism. We can also show that the number of\nindividuals that chose a TT previously has an effect on the likelihood of chosing the TT\nin a given round. Hence, we believe that there is an effect beyond information transfer.\nSubsequently, we look at treatment heterogeneities to analyze whether there is a dif-\nference in peer effects for individuals with different background characteristics. We show\nthat those with the highest cognitive ability are less susceptible to peer effects. Using\nthe same technique, we do not find any effect for overconfident, underconfident or higher\nincome respondents. Similarly, we find that peer effects seem to be stronger for those that\nlive in small villages compared to those that live in large villages.\nTo sum up, we are able to show using a lab-in-the-field experiment that the observation\nof peers has a significant impact on consumption choices. We find evidence of conver-\ngence in consumption choices when observing one's peers. Our results contribute to the\nliterature on conformity and herding behavior where conformity is defined as an intrinsic\ntaste to follow others (Goeree and Yariv, 2010), driven by factors such as popularity,\nobservational learning, information, esteem and respect (Bernheim, 1994). Experimental\nfindings of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000) show that a possi-\nble explanations for herding behavior is the reduction in expected inequality or inequality\naversion among subjects.\nA number of experimental studies use a similar experimental design to study peer\neffects; Falk and Ichio (2006), randomly assign participants either to a group or not in\norder to study the effect of peers on productivity. In another study Baecker and Mechtel\n(2014) use a similar design in order to study the effect of peers on cheating behaviour.\nThese studies have the advantage that they provide a clear counterfactual and control for\ncontextual effects, thus providing the cleanest evidence on peer effects.\nFurther empirical evidence on peer-group phenomena can be found in the context of\nother economic behaviors. They seem to have a positive impact, for instance, in terms\nof workers' productivity (Guryan et al., 2009; Mas and Moretti, 2009; Bandiera et al.,\nand Thornton, 2012), and saving and investment decisions (Duflo and Saez, 2003; Viscusi\net al., 2011). Georgarakos et al. (2014) show that believing to be relatively worse off than\none's social circle influence the amount of debt held. The link between peer effects and\nconsumption is not new. Veblen (1898) argued that people consume certain conspicuous\ngoods in order to increase their social standing. Luttmer (2004) shows that living amongst\nricher individuals leads to higher consumption while at the same time reducing happi-\nness. These results, however, rely mostly on observational data which makes it difficult\nto separate peer effects from the effect of confounding factors.\nRecent papers try to measure peer effects in terms of education using, for instance,\nnatural experiments to overcome the problem of correlated effects such as the random\nassignment of college students to their respective dorms (Sacerdote, 2001; Chetty et al.,\n2015) or the exogenous influx of students in neighboring schools after the hurricane Ka-\ntrina (Imberman et al., 2012). Roth (2014) looks at the effect of a random cash transfer\nprogram and shows that it leads to conspicuous consumption. However, even with `natu-\nral' experiments when the setting offers an enhanced strategy to identify peer effects, the\nimpossibility of controlling for all local or personal confounding factors does not provide\na clean identification strategy.\nAnother recent strand of literature uses the existence of partially overlapping groups\nof peers to solve issues related to both reflection and correlated effects. The intuition is\nthat partially overlapping groups generate peers of peers (or excluded peers) who act as\ninstruments in the simultaneous equation model of social interactions and, thus, solve the\nreflection problem (de Giorgi et al., 2010).\nSomething that has been rarely attempted so far when looking at peer effects is to\ndistinguish between the different reasons that cause individuals to behave in a similar\nway to their peers. To our knowledge, this distinction has so far only been attempted by\nusing carefully designed experiments. Cai et al. (2009) look at an experiment with two\ntreatments in a restaurant setting in order to distinguish the effect of social learning from\nthe effect of salience. Burszytyn et al. (2014) study the demand for a complex financial\nfund, using a brokerage firm in Brazil. The authors aim to distinguish between wanting\nwhat others have and the information effect of knowing what the other person believes.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our\ndata and experimental design. Section 3 presents the conceptual framework. We discuss\ndescriptive statistics and group level results in Section 4. Section 5 provides individual\nlevel results while further robustness tests are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.\n2.1 Household Survey Data and Sampling\nOur peer experiment was conducted as part of the larger household survey of the research\nproject \"Impact of shocks on the vulnerability to poverty: Consequences for development\nof emerging Southeast Asian economies\" funded by the German Research Foundation\nwhich has been conducted in three Northeastern provinces of Thailand since 2007. The\nhousehold survey contains detailed information on many aspects of households' living stan-\ndards including: household demographics, recurrent and durable expenditures, credit and\nsavings, landholdings, agriculture, employment, health, and education. It also includes\ninformation concerning village characteristics such as the number of village institutions\nor infrastructure (i.e. irrigation system, access to electricity, nurseries etc.), in - and out-\nward village migration, inhabitants, but also the number of shocks occurring in a village.\nThis data provides a representative sample of rural households in the Northeastern part\nof Thailand.\nThe sampling procedure of rural households for the peer experiment conducted in\nUbon Ratchathani follows a three-stage stratified sampling procedure. It is important to\nknow that we exclude the urban area around the provincial capital city and confine the\nsample to the remaining rural areas. In the first stage sub-districts within the province\nwere chosen with probability proportional to size and implicit stratification by population\ndensity. In the second stage, from each sampled sub-district, two villages were sampled\nrandomly with probability of selection proportional to size. In the last step, in each of\nthose villages a systematic random sample of ten households was drawn to be interviewed\nfrom the household lists of the rural census ordered by household size. To conclude, vil-\nlages as well as respondents were randomly sampled for our peer experiment.\nOur peer experiment was conducted in the largest of the three provinces, Ubon\nRatchathani. In addition to the experiment, we also collected a number of variables\nto complement the socio-demographic variables collected during the household survey.\nQuestions designed to measure cognitive abilities were asked after the peer experiment.\nWe collected two types of questions (Details are reported in Appendix B). Firstly, we\ncollected a number of math based questions. In total there were six questions, the first\nfour are based on the hardest four out of eight math questions in Cole et al. (2011), the\nlast two questions are based on question used in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retire-\nment in Europe (SHARE). In addition, we included a question that asks respondents to\nname as many animals as they can in 60 seconds. This is a measure of word fluency and\nhas the advantage that it is related to more innate forms of intelligence and especially\nmeasures processing speed. This test for word fluency has also been used in a number of\nother studies as part of cognitive ability measures such as Dohmen et al. (2010).\nFinally, we ask respondents to judge how many of these questions they answered\ncorrectly to measure overconfidence. Overconfidence results in unrealistically positive\nself-evaluations. In other words, people are unrealistically optimistic and overestimate\npersonal success probabilities. Our primary measure of confidence is the difference be-\ntween the predicted math score and the achieved score. Thus, a subject whose prediction\nis higher than her actual score is called overconfident, and a subject whose prediction is\nbelow her actual score is called underconfident.\n2.2 Experimental Design\nThe peer experiment was conducted in August 2013 with a total of 521 respondents from\n66 villages in Ubon Ratchathani. The experiment was performed three month after the\nhousehold survey.\nThe experiment was carried out by local enumerators with one of the co-authors being\npresent at all times. Instructions were translated from English into Thai and back, and\nwere cross-checked by a Thai economics professor to avoid semantic difficulties. Instruc-\ntions were kept as simple as possible. The interviewers were trained in sessions that lasted\na total of five days. During these five days, a pilot study was conducted in three villages.\nThe experiment was conducted by visiting two villages per day; one in the morning\nand one in the afternoon. For neighboring villages experiments were usually carried out\nsimultaneously. The distance between villages was on average 18 km and respondents\nhad to stay at the experimental site until the completion of the survey. There were two\nexperimental sessions conducted in each village, with up to five respondents in one session\nat the same time. All experimental sessions took place in the village hall.\nThe experiment consists of a very simple choice task that required no previous knowl-\nedge, was easy to implement and to measure in the field with a rural sample (see Ap-\npendix A for detailed instructions). The respondent has to choose between the tasty\ntreat and a certain amount of money. In the first round, for instance, the enumerator\nasks respondents whether they would like to choose the tasty treat or 10 THB. Respon-\ndents have to express their choices to their assigned enumerator. Once the respondent\nhas decided in each round, the enumerator moves to the next round. Now the respondent\nhas to choose between the tasty treat and 20 THB. Since we have seven rounds, in the\nlast round the respondent has to choose between the tasty treat and 70 THB. In order to\nmake the experiment as easy to follow for respondents as possible, we use showcards that\ndisplay the amount of money they can chose. The tasty treat is also placed directly in\nfront of the respondent. In round four there is no price difference between the two choices.\nAfter round four, it becomes increasingly unreasonable to choose the tasty treat because\nof the significant price difference. The enumerator marks the decision in each round. We\ndid allow switching back and forth. There were 24 respondents who switched twice and\nwere dropped in later analysis.\nBefore the experiment, respondents were asked to estimate the price of the tasty treat.\nAfter their prediction, all respondents were told that the tasty treat costs 40 Baht in order\nto avoid information asymmetries concerning the value of the product.\nAnother important component of our experiment was that they could receive the tasty\ntreat right after the experiment while they had to wait for the money until the end of\nthe session, thus enhancing temptation. Time-discounting factors can largely be ignored\nsince the experiment, including post-experiment questions, only took between one to two\nhours to complete. Respondents were also reminded that they had to stay and answer\nfurther questions (risk attitude, financial literacy, overconfidence and cognitive ability)\nafter the experiment.\nThe tasty treat consists of very popular items that are widely known across the coun-\ntry - a can of coke, a piece of custard cake, a small package of lays classic crisps, a bar of\nchocolate, and a small pack of candies. It had a value of 40 Thai Baht (THB) (approxi-\nmately 1 Euro). We made sure that it not only included sweet but also savory items so\nthat it appeals to a wider range of tastes. During the experiment, we made sure that the\nrespondents did not get any food or sweet beverages to drink.\nOnce all seven choices have been made, one decision was randomly played out by pick-\ning a number between 1 and 7 from a non-transparent bag. In case the respondent picked\nnumber 3 and chose the tasty treat in row 3, she received the tasty treat immediately. In\ncase, the respondent picked money in that row, the respondent would receive 30 Baht at\nthe end of the survey with an additional 50 Baht for participating in the survey. After the\nexperiment, respondents were asked how much he/she would be willing to pay at most to\nreceive the tasty treat.\nFor practical reasons we randomized into treatment and control group on the village\nlevel. Hence in control villages respondents played alone i.e. without peer observation,\nwhile in treatment villages respondents played in close proximity with peer observation.\nIn the control group, the tasty treat game was played individually and was conducted\nwith 261 individuals in 66 groups. To avoid peer observation, we made sure that respon-\ndents were separated across the town hall so that they could neither hear nor see the\nchoices of the other respondents. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the decisions of one\nrespondent affects other respondents in the control group because individuals respond at\ndifferent speeds.\nThe peer treatment was conducted with 260 individuals in 60 groups. The size of the\ngroup ranges from three to five people. The procedure of the treatment is the same as\nin the individual treatment with the sole exception that decisions were conducted with\npeer observation. Each respondent is still responsible for their own decision, but they\nhave to sit next to each other and perform the experiment. As in the control group, all\nthe instructions were read out loud and showcards were used to demonstrate the possible\nchoices between tasty treat and money in each round. Enough tasty treats were on dis-\nplay, so that each respondent can see that there are enough for everyone to chose. The\nprincipal enumerator would read out the instructions. In each round each respondent\nwould announce their choice out loud and the enumerator assigned to them would mark\ntheir choice. After all respondents have made their choice, the group moves on to the next\nround. There is no particular order in which respondents have to answer. We allowed\neveryone to answer in their own time.\nGiven our experimental design, we cannot observe an order in which participants an-\nswer. What we can observe, however, is whether the spatial proximity of the peer in\nconjunction with their announcement of the decision to the group affects consumption\nchoices of the individual. The difference between the treatment and the control group is\nsimply that choices are observable to peers.\nGiven our random assignment of individuals to play the game alone or in a group, we\nare able to create counterfactual groups out of those individuals that played the game at\nthe same time as their peers, but without directly observing their peers. We have two\ntypes of groups, those that performed the experiment directly observing each other and\nthose that played the game at the same time in the same room, but not directly observing\neach other. Hence the only difference between our treatment and control group is that\nthe treatment group observed their peers and the control group did not. Any difference\nin group outcomes can therefore be attributed to the only difference - peer observation.\n2.3 Descriptive Statistics\nTable 1 shows individual characteristics of our sample. First, we have significantly more\nwomen in our sample (60%). As we are deliberately sampling the household head, average\nage is relatively high at 54 years and 83% of respondents are married. Socio-demographic\ncharacteristics of our sample are typical for rural northern Thailand; education levels\nare still relatively low with less than six years on average. The average household has\nmore than four members with a dependency ratio of 1.48 dependents for every working\nmember. The vast majority of respondents name farming as their main occupation, with\nthe rest being made up of government officials, business owners, students and housewives.\nAs this study uses eatable goods to examine the consumption of temptation goods, it\nis interesting to look at BMI, a standardized measure of weight to height ratio. The\naverage in our sample is 23 which is the normal BMI range according to the WHO. In\nterms of village characteristics, the average distance to the next district capital and to\nthe provincial capital, Ubon, is 16 km and 60 km respectively. This is important to\nknow and to control for because the demand for the temptation good may be larger the\nfurther the distance of the village to the nearest town. The average number of shocks in\nour 66 villages was 1.45 ranging from 1 to 3 shocks in total. The number of households\nin a village varies significantly from 813 households close to the provincial capital to 55\nhouseholds only which has also the highest distance to the provincial capital Ubon. Peer\neffects may be larger the smaller the village is because people may know each other better.\nDespite considerable growth in rural Thailand over the last decades, the north east is still\nrelatively poor which is reflected in the average rate of consumption and average household\nwealth.\nIn addition to standard socio-demographic variables, we also collected a number of\nvariables that are designed to measure cognitive ability. This allows us to study the peer\neffect on a sample with different levels of cognitive ability. Firstly, we collected a number\nof math based questions. In a first step, we awarded one point for each question answered\ncorrectly. The average score achieved is 3.6 out of six. Numeracy shows a near normal\ndistribution with 1.99% scoring no point and only 4.81% scoring full six points. Second,\nwe asked respondents to name as many animals as they can in 60 seconds. The average\nnumber of animals named is 17.2; however the standard deviation for this measure is rather\nlarge at 6.86. The correlation between the two cognitive ability measures, numeracy test\nand word fluency is 0.355 (Spearman; p-value<0.001). Thus, the two tests capture a\nsimilar underlying trait but also distinct aspects of cognitive ability. Third, we follow the\nsame procedure as Dohmen et al. (2010) and use a single combined measure of cognitive\nability.\nFinally, we also measure overconfidence of our respondents to see whether over and\nunderconfident respondents are more susceptible to peer effects. We define a subject whose\nmath prediction is higher than his/her actual score as overconfident, and a subject whose\nprediction is below her actual score is called underconfident. Using this measure, 37% of\nour sample are overconfident while 33% are underconfident. Overconfidence is positively\ncontrast, the correlation between high cognitive skills (highest 10%) and underconfidence\nTable 2 shows results of our paired t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test to check for\ndifferences between treatment and control groups. It shows that randomization was mostly\nsuccessful and that there are no significant differences in observables between those that\nplayed the tasty treat game alone and those that played the game with peer observation.\nThe only difference that can be seen is that those played in a group have on average more\nchildren which is statistically significant in the t-test and in the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\nThe distance to Ubon, the provincial capital, is also larger in the control group, according\nto both tests. We will control for this difference in further analysis.\nAs this study not only compares the behavior of individuals but also looks at the\nbehavior of groups, it is important to check that group composition is the same between\nthose that played in observing and non-observing groups. There are 126 groups in total.\n60 groups are observing group, while the rest played in non-observing group. Table 3\nshows that group composition stays mostly the same on average when looking at measured\nobservables. In line with Table 2, Table 3 shows that on average respondents assigned\nto the treatment group have a higher number of children, which is significantly different\nfor both the t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We control for possible confounding\neffects in later regressions.\n3 Conceptual Framework\nIn this section we present our conceptual framework that explores the relationship between\nthe choice of money m, the individual choice of a tasty treat tt and the group's choice of\n\u00af\ntt. In this section, we ignore the effect of individual preferences as denoted by x and \u00af\nx\nlater on in this paper. We can justify this as we are conducting an experiment and due to\npersonal preferences being the same across treatments. Hence each participant's utility\nfunction is defined as:\nU(tt, m; D, \u00af\ntt) = u(tt, m) - D \u00b7 c(tt - \u00af\ntt)\nThe first component u(tt, m) is both increasing and concave in both tt and m. It\nrepresents the utility that an individual receives from choosing the tt or m, whereas the\nchoice in tt  {0, 1} and m  {10, ..., 70}. Because individuals have to decide between tt\nand m, tt = 1 implies m = 0 and m > 0 implies tt = 0. Also note that the difference\nu(0, m) - u(1, 0) is increasing in m: the higher m, the smaller the share of individuals\nthat will prefer tasty treatment to money, i.e.\nPr(tt m|D)\nm\nThe utility function above includes a conformity cost function c(tt- \u00af\ntt)  0. This cost\nfunction is increasing, the larger the difference between own choice tt of the respondent\nand average consumption of the peer group \u00af\ntt.\nc(tt - \u00af\ntt)\n\n\n\n\n\n> 0 if tt = \u00af\ntt\n= 0 if tt = \u00af\ntt\nIn this model we do not go into the source of this cost. In our view there could be\na number of reasons behind this, which we discuss later on. More importantly note that\nthis conformity cost only applies to those individuals that play in a group. In the case of\nthe experiment in the control group D = 0, the conformity cost function should not play\na role. In single treatment, the tt is preferred if\nIn the group treatment, tt is chosen if\ntt) > u(0, m) - c(0 - \u00af\ntt).\nAs participants possess the same utility function U(), average peer tasty treat con-\nsumption \u00af\ntt must also be decreasing in m. Therefore, c(1-\u00af\ntt)\nm\ntt)\nm\nother words the conformity cost of choosing tt increases the larger m is. It should be\nnoted that \u00af\ntt also depends on tt and is therefore endogenous. Since choosing the tt is\nsynonymous with not choosing m, it is easier to think of a cost function that looks at the\ncost of choosing tt at different levels of m. In this case the cost of choosing tt would be\npositive for high values of m, but negative for low m. Figure 1 shows the relationship\nbetween m, Pr(tt) and c(1 - \u00af\ntt).\nm\nPr(tt) / c(1 - \u00af\ntt)\ntt)\nPr(tt) Sin-\ngle\nPr(tt)\nPeer\nE\nE\nAt point E the conformity cost for those that played with peer observation is 0. They,\ntherefore, make the same decision on average as those that play without peer observation.\nIt becomes clear from Figure 1 that the respondents under peer treatment react more\nstrongly to a change in m than respondents under single treatment\nPr(tt m|D = 0)\nm\n<\nPr(tt m|D = 1)\nm\n.\nIntuitively, this seems logical as there in an extra benefit from choosing the tt when m\nis small and an extra cost in choosing tt when m is large. This means that in the peer\ntreatment, we expect that fewer people switch from m to tt at an early or late stage. In\nturn, we expect this to lower standard deviation within a group. So far we have shown the\ndifferent reactions of tt to a change in m, between the peer and the single treatment. We\nnow need to show that the aforementioned conformity cost leads to a positive relationship\nbetween tt and \u00af\ntt which can be defined as peer effects. From the original utility function\nwe can see that\nPr(tt m|D = 0)\n \u00af\ntt\nHence there is no change in tt as \u00af\ntt change in the single treatment. Whereas under peer\ntreatment\nPr(tt m|D = 1)\n \u00af\ntt\nThere is a positive relationship between the number of people that choose tt and the\naverage peer decision \u00af\ntt.\nAs previously mentioned there are two conclusions that rise from including a confor-\nmity cost function into a standard utility function. Firstly, as there is a cost involved with\nnot doing what everyone also is doing, we expect there to be fewer extreme choices under\npeer observation. At the same time, we expect there to be a clear positive relationship\nbetween tt and \u00af\ntt when the experiment is performed under peer observation, but not when\nthe experiment is performed alone.\n4 Group Level Results\n4.1 Comparing Groups\nWe begin our analysis of the effects of peer observation by studying the difference between\nthose groups that played the game observing each other and those that played the game\nat the same time and under the same conditions but not observing each other. T-tests\nand Wilcoxon-rank test compare decisions between the two types of groups in Table 4.\nAt first, it seems that there is no difference in the mean group choice of the last row that\nwas chosen in each playing situation. Hence, the average last row chosen in observing as\nwell as non-observing groups is the same.\nHowever, we can see a difference in the standard deviation between those groups that\nplayed together and those that did not. The standard deviation within a group for those\ngroups that observed each other is significantly lower than for those groups that did not\nobserve each other. Those that play in the observing group are less likely to switch either\nvery early or very late. This can also be seen when looking at the group minimum and\nthe group maximum. The group minimum is the lowest switching point of anyone within\nthe group, whereas the group maximum is the highest switching point within a group.\nWe can see that the group minimum is significantly higher and the group maximum is\nsignificantly lower when the game is played with peers observing each other.\nThe finding is further supported by Figure 2 which shows a kernal density plot of\nmean group choices for observing and non-observing groups. Here we can see that mean\ngroup choices take both higher and lower values when the game is played without peer\nobservation. The kernal density function also shows that the standard deviation is lower\nin observing groups.\nWe further test the finding described above using regression analysis whilst controlling\nfor group composition in Table 5. Outcome variables stay the same as above, namely\ngroup mean, group minimum, group maximum, and group standard deviation. The peer\ndummy is unity if the group played with peer observation. In these regressions we control\nfor group level mean characteristics. We confirm our finding from above. When the ex-\nperiment is played with peer observation, standard deviation of choices within the group\nis lower. The same can be seen when looking at the group minimum and maximum. The\ncoefficient on the peer dummy is positive in the regression estimating the group minimum\nand negative and significant in the regression estimating the group maximum. Interest-\ningly, group composition seems to have only a limited influence on the tasty treat choice.\nGroups with more women switch from tasty treat to money earlier. Similarly, there seems\nto be an effect of groups that are richer, i.e. that have higher average consumption. Both\nTable 4 and Table 5 show that there is a significant difference in consumption choices\nbetween observing and non-observing groups. We find that consumption choices converge\nin the observing groups. Hence, there is evidence for conformity when respondents ob-\nserve each other.\nPerforming the experiment in a group seems to effect those that would have chosen\nthe money early on or stuck with the tasty treat until very late the most. This can\nbe seen in more detail in Table 6. Here we again use t-test and Wilcoxon-rank tests\nto compare deciles between observing and non-observing groups. We can see that the\nfirst and second decile in observing groups is higher than the non-observing groups. The\nopposite can be seen when looking at the eighth and ninth decile. This is significantly\nhigher in non-observing groups than in observing groups. This effect is stronger for the\nhigher deciles. Of course, one cannot directly compare individuals, as no one performs\nthe experiment in the treatment and in the control group, but from this it looks like peer\nobservation particularly effects those that would have made extreme choices.\n4.2 Giving in to Temptation?\nWe here briefly discuss our respondent's propensity to give in to temptation. This ex-\nperiment was deliberately performed using temptation goods, as evidence suggests that\ndemand for these goods is more likely to be influenced by the presence of peers. At\nthe same time, we believe that playing the game with temptation goods and hence non-\nessential good gives cleaner evidence of the effect of peer observation. It is possible that\nplaying the game with other goods that can be considered neccessities, would have had a\nconfounding effect on choices made by individuals.\nWe here define giving in to temptations as choosing the tasty treat far beyond its\nvalue of 40 Baht. From the tables discussed above and especially from Figure 2 we can\nsee that giving in to temptation does not happen a lot. Indeed, the mean of the aver-\nage group choice for both the treatment and control group is just below three, meaning\nthat the average respondent switches from the amount of money offered well below the\npurchasing value of the tasty treat. The same applies to median choice, which lies just\nbelow three for both the treatment and the control group. Moreover, when looking at\nFigure 2, it becomes clear that there is considerable variation between choices made.\nSome group average choices are below the point whereas some are far above the point\nwhere the amount offered is equal to the money. From here we can clearly see that some\npeople do give in to temptation, but also that peer observation seems to prevent people\nfrom giving in to temptation. However, peer observation not only reduces the switching\npoint of those that would otherwise have given in to temptation, but it also raises the\nswitching point of those that would have switched very early. Therefore, our results are\ncaused by conformity to the group, and less likely by peer observation preventing people\nfrom giving in to temptation.\n5 Individual Level Results\n5.1 Identification Strategy\nWe are interested in identifying causal peer effects on the individual decision-making and\nunderstanding whether consumption is affected by the observation of peers. The iden-\ntification of peer effects, however, suffers from a number of econometric issues (Manski,\n1993; Moffit, 2001) which can be summarized into three categories: (a) correlated effects,\n(b) contextual effects, and (c) endogenous effects.\nCorrelated effects in consumption choices may emerge if socially-related individuals\nunder study share preferences and characteristics that make them more likely to select into\na peer group and these characteristics are important determinants of the dependent vari-\nable. This means that peer groups that have evolved naturally are therefore more similar\nto each other than if they had been chosen randomly. This may lead to the appearance to\npeer effects, but in reality those observed are simply behaving similarly because they are\nsimilar. Contextual effects may emerge if individuals share common environments and\nunobserved shocks (i.e. rainfall in the village) that make their consumption move simul-\ntaneously independently of any genuine peer effects. These are sometimes also referred\nto as time-variant unobservables, while correlated effects are referred to as time invariant\nobservables. Finally, endogenous effects represent the phenomenon where the group af-\nfects individual behavior through social interaction (i.e. is the individual's consumption\nchoice affected by the group consumption choice). It is the third effect what we are trying\nto separate in this study.\nOur experimental design (discussed in detail in Section 2) represents an attempt to\nsurmount the challenge of identifying a causal peer effect. Much of the literature follow-\ning Manski has focused on the econometric issue of separating the causal peer effect from\nthat of correlated unobservables (Miguel and Kremer, 2004; Bandiera and Rasul, 2006;\nConley and Udry, 2010). Two ways of disentangling these effects are to (1) randomize\nnew technology (Kremer and Miguel, 2007; Oster and Thornton, 2012; Godlonton and\nThornton, 2012). We follow the first approach.\nThe double randomization in our experimental design, that is, first randomly select-\ning households to perform the experiment given the sampling procedure and second ran-\ndomizing peer and control treatments according to villages, circumvents the problem of\ncorrelated effects.\nSince we chose randomly who plays in a peer group and who is part of that peer group,\nthere are unlikely to be any unobservables that would systematically influence the choices\nmade by the individual. Hence we can circumvent the problem of correlated effects. At\nthe same time, our experiment takes place in a relatively controlled environment and\nonly takes a short period of time. It is, hence, unlikely that unobservable time-variant\ncharacteristics influence decisions made by respondent.\nFor the identification of endogenous peer effects we use the so-called leave-out mean\nas the regressor in our main analysis in order to analyze the effect of the group average\nconsumption on the individual consumption choice.2\nTo identify the effect of peer observation, we will estimate the main regression model\nin the following form using least squares estimation:\nYij\n= \u00af\ny-i,j\n+ \u00af\nx-i,j\n+ xi,j\n+ ui,j\nIn our framework, Yij\nis the consumption choice of tasty treat for individual i who has\ngroup affiliation j (observing or non-observing group). In our main analysis Yij\nwill be\nthe last row in which they choose the tasty treat before switching to money. However,\nwe also run similar regressions using a variable that is one if participants always chose\ntasty treat over money or if they decided not to choose tasty treat at all. The coefficient\nof interest is , the coefficient on the group mean. This is the group outcome net of\nindividual i's outcome, a quantity commonly referred to as the leave-out mean. In our\nanalysis we split the sample into those that performed the experiment in observing and\nnon-observing groups. We expect  to be positive when the experiment is performed with\npeer observation and so indicating positive peer effects. When the experiment is, on the\nother hand, performed without peer observation we expect  to be close to 0. This will\nindicate to us that we are really observing endogenous peer effects that are not caused by\ncorrelated or contextual effects.\n2While we are able to identify endogenous peer effects, we are not able to circumvent the reflection\nproblem entirely.\nIn many peer studies, researchers would often use the group mean inclusive of the in-\ndividual, \u00af\nyij\n. However, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, because regressing\n\u00af\nyij\non yij\nresults in a coefficient of 1, entering unity. Therefore, any peer group measure\nmust vary within groups in order to satisfy the rank condition. This would rule out tak-\ning the average outcome of the group as the regressor. Instead taking the leave-out mean\nallows inter-group correlation coefficients since there is a different group average for each\nrespondent, calculated from the decision of the other group members. This approach has\nFollowing this, we include the variable \u00af\nx-i,j\nwhich is the vector of average group\nsocio-economic characteristics in group j, excluding the individual i. A set of individual\ncharacteristics such as female, age, schooling, log consumption, household size, depen-\ndency ratio, and BMI that may affect consumption decisions compose xi,j\n. The error\nterm uij\nis clustered on the village level.\nAs we assign respondents randomly into peers groups, we assume E(uij\n|xij\n) = 0, i.e.,\nno correlated effects or self-selection into groups. Thus, if we observe a difference in out-\ncomes between observing and non-observing groups we can attribute this directly to the\n(on average) only difference between these groups, namely peer observation.\nAs a next step we look at peer effects and their effect on individual decisions as described\nin the previous section. We find an effect of the group average on the individual decision-\nmaking concerning consumption choice. We here perform the regression described above.\nResults are presented in Table 7, Panel A. The first two columns cover the entire sample.\nWe find that there is a significant and positive relationship between the average switching\npoint in the group and individual's switching point. When looking at these results only,\nhowever, it is conceivable that this relationship may be caused by unobserved variables\nIn the next four columns, however, we split out sample into those that played the game\nin observing groups and those that played in non-observing groups (denoted as Peer and\nSingle). Here, we can clearly see that the effect observed above is caused by peers observ-\ning each other directly and not caused by unobserved correlated or contextual variables.\nIn columns 3 and 4 we show results for those individuals that played in observing groups\nwith and without control variables. We can see that the effect here is significant and\nstronger than for the full subject pool. The coefficient of interest only reduces slightly\nwhen we introduce the control variables. The only other significant relationship we find\nis the difference between males and females. Females seem to choose the tasty treat less\ncompared to men. Columns 5 and 6 show the same regression but for respondents that\nplay the game without peer observation. Here the effect of the average peer choice has\nno effect on the individual's switching row. Similarly, in column 7 we introduce an in-\nteraction term between the group average and a dummy that takes the value one if the\ngame was played in an observing group. The interaction term is positive and significant\nand so we can conclude that the relationship between the group average and the point of\nswitching is not the same between observing and unobserving groups.\nThese results in Table 7, Panel A, described above indicate to us that the peer\neffects that we observe in columns 3 and 4 above, is not caused by unobserved correlated\nor contextual variables but rather by peers observing each other and making the same\nobservation at the same time.\nIn Table 7, Panel B and Table 7, Panel C we perform the same exercise, but with\ndifferent dependent variables to see whether individuals consumption decision is still af-\nfected by the group, even for those individuals that may lean towards extreme choices. In\nPanel B we use a dependent term that is a dummy taking the value of 1 if the respondent\nchooses the tasty treat in every round. In Panel C we also use an indicator variable that\nis 1 if the respondent never chooses the tasty treat, hence preferring the money from row\n1 until row 7. Both tables exhibit the same pattern as the previous table. The group?s\naverage consumption choice does influence the individual's choice in both tables. In Panel\nB, for instance, it can be said that if the group consumption average increases in the peer\ntreatment, the more likely is the respondent to choose the tasty treat in every round.\nThese results are highly significant at the 1% significance level even when controlling\nfor observable factors. Noticeable is also the relative high R2. The socio-demographic\ncovariates plus the group average excluding the individual seem to explain a large share\nof the variation in the dependent variable. Conversely in Panel C, we find that if the\ngroup average is higher, it is less likely that the respondent never chooses the tasty treat.\nMost importantly, all these relationships only holds if the decisions are made under peer\nobservation and does not hold if the game is played at the same time but without peer\nobservation. Hence, we find that observability of the behavior of peers leads to conforming\nbehavior, thus confirming the descriptive results in the previous section.\nSo far, we have found strong evidence in consumption choices. We show that the standard\ndeviation of choices is smaller, the maximum switching row is lower and the minimum\nswitching point is higher if the experiment is conducted with peer observation. At the\nsame time, we were able to show that individuals are clearly influenced by their groups,\nas group averages have an influence on the individual decision-making. However, it is not\nclear what the source of this group conformity is.\nIn this section, we will now attempt to look into the mechanism that operates these\nobserved effects further. In the literature, a number of reasons behind peer effects are\ndiscussed (Bikhchandani et al., 1998; Cai et al., 2009). We here attempt to look at two\nfactors. Firstly, peer effects have been argued to be caused by respondent's believe that\nothers have better information. Hence by doing what others are doing individuals are\ndrawing on their peer's information. Secondly, individuals could simply follow their peers\nbecause they are gaining some kind of network externality or psychological benefit from\ndoing the same as others in their group. Due to the set up of our experiment, we are\nunable to provide definite answers. Nonetheless, these results provide some interesting\ninsights into the mechanisms that are behind the observed conformity.\nWe will here firstly discuss the effect of information since peer effects have been exten-\nsively examined in the context of informational spillovers (Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995;\nscribed above, we asked respondent to estimate how much the tasty treat costs to buy in\na shop. We use this response as a proxy for how familiar the respondents are with the\nproduct. We create a dummy that is unity if the respondent wrongly estimates the price.\nWe introduce this dummy, together with an interaction term between the dummy and\nthe leave-out-mean into the regression as described above. Results are shown in Table 8.\nInterestingly, unfamiliarity with the tasty treat makes the respondent less likely to choose\nit, but only in the single treatment. Not knowing the price of a product has no effect\non the likelihood of choosing the tasty treat in the peer treatment. Hence, it seems that\nindividual's benefit from some kind of information tranfer or social learning by following\nthe group.\nIn order to look into the other possible reason behind this mechanism further, we look\nat the decision of respondents to switch in a certain round, depending on the proportion\nof his groups that has switched in a previous round. Table 9 shows results. The right\nhand variable is a dummy that is one if the respondent switches from the tasty treat to the\nmoney in a certain row. The dependent variable is the proportion that chose the money\ni.e. had switched in previous rounds. Table 9 shows these regressions for both the single\nand the peer treatment and for the decision taken in rounds up to round four. Since most\npeople only switch once, the regressions only include people that had not switched in\nprevious rounds. All regressions include individual level and group level control variables.\nWe can see from these regressions that the proportion of people that had switched in the\nprevious rounds has a positive effect on the likelihood that a respondent will switch from\nTT to money in a given round. However, this relationship breaks down after round three,\npossibly because the number of people that had not switched beforehand is very small.\nTable 9 indicate that the number of people that decide to switch is important for the\ndecision made by the individual. It indicates that there is some kind of network exter-\nnality at play here as it appears that people seem to benefit from doing the same as the\npeople in their group when playing with peer observation.\nThese results indicate that peer observation counteract the effect of a lack of informa-\ntion on a product. It seems that individuals obtain some sort of information by observing\neach other's actions. This way they are able to optimize self-interested behavior. Gaining\ninformation from peers therefore seems to play a role in peer effects. At the same time,\nwe find evidence of people following each other. However, we cannot draw definite con-\nclusions about the mechanism behind peer effects. Network externalities seem to play a\nrole here alongside information effects.\n5.4 Treatment Heterogeneity\nIn this section, we test whether certain people are more likely to succumb to peer effects.\nWe here look at both behavioural types and the social environment in which people live to\nsee if some are more likely to conform than others. It is, for instance, conceivable that high\n(low) cognitive ability individuals within their group are more able to resist (succumb) to\npeer effects. There is a growing literature linking cognitive ability and financial literacy\nto improved financial behaviors and outcomes (see for instance Agrawal and Mazumder,\n2013; Bertrand and Morse, 2011). We hypothesize that high cognitive ability individuals\nshould be less prone to peer pressure while the opposite should be true for low skilled\nrespondents.\nAs discussed above we included a number of questions designed to study cognitive\nability. Now we create a dummy in our standard model for those that have the highest\nand lowest cognitive ability score compared to their peers within the group to test the\neffect of relative cognitive ability in a group. In order to test for the effect of absolute\ncognitive ability we generate a dummy for those that scored in the highest 10% of the\ndistribution. We include these dummies together with an interaction term between the\ndummy and the leave-out-mean into our regressions above using only the peer treatment.\nAs before standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the village level. Table 10 shows\nresults. We find that the high cognitive ability (both in relative term to their groups and\nin absolute terms) individuals are less likely to succumb to peer effects. We, however, do\nnot find any statistically significant results for low cognitive ability people (results not\nreported in the table).\nWe also investigate the effect of other personality traits. We use the same methods to\ntest whether overconfidence drives economic decision in our peer experiment. We hypoth-\nesize that those who are overconfident may be less susceptible to peer effects. While we\ndo get the expected sign, that is to say, that overconfident people take tasty treat in later\nrounds, the results are statistically insignificant. Hence, we do not find that overconfi-\ndence matters in terms of peer decisions (Details upon request). We also use this method\nto test whether those with the highest consumption are more susceptible to succumb to\npeer effects. We do not find any significant results (Details upon request).\nAnother interesting question is whether people that live in closer knit communities are\nmore susceptible to peer effects. The conformity cost of not doing what everyone else in\nthe group is doing may be higher for those that live in communities with stronger social\nties. As there is no way of measuring this directly, we test to see if the peer effect is\nstronger for those living in smaller villages. We hence create a dummy that is unity for\nthose respondents that live in villages that are smaller than the median. Again, we also\ninclude an interaction term between this dummy and the leave out mean. Results are\nshown in Table 10 in column five and six. We can see that the small village dummy as\nwell as the interaction term are significant. This shows us that those that live in smaller\nvillages are more likely to conform to the group. This indicates that stronger social ties\nmay lead to stronger conforming behavior.\n6 Robustness\nStrictly speaking it is conceivable that the peer effects that we observe earlier on are\nnot caused by peer effects since our randomization took place on the village level rather\nthan the individual level. This, however, seems very unlikely. For this to happen the\nrandomization would have to work in a way that those that played in observing groups\nare more alike than those that played in the non-observing groups. Since the number\nof groups is fairly large and we are also able to control for a large number of observable\nfactors, we believe that such a concern can be neglected. However, to exclude further\ndoubt, we test whether standard deviations of observed variables are the same between\nobserving and non-observing groups. Results are shown in Table 11. From the t-test\nand Wilcoxon-rank test, we can see that standard deviations are the same for observing\nand non-observing groups. We therefore reject the idea that our results are caused by\nobserving groups being more similar than non-observing groups.\nIn Table 3 we control for a large number of socio-demographic group means. Here we\nalso check if group standard deviations in socio-demographic characteristics may make\na difference to the effect of peer observation on group level results. It is possible that\ngroups that are similar (by coincidence) make more similar decisions. This is not the\ncase. Results stay the same when controlling for group level standard deviations in socio-\ndemographic variables.\nNext, we also check if the main results hold when we change the way the dependent\nvariable is coded. In order to do this, we create two dummies. The first takes the value of\none if the respondent switched before the money amount increased to 40 Baht, the second\ntakes the value of one if the respondent switches after the money amount is increased to\n40 Baht. We run all the regressions again and find that the results do not change. The\ngroup average still has a significant effect on these outcome variables.\nFurthermore, we check whether in addition to the distance of the villages to Ubon,\nthe provincial capital city, or the nearest district capital has an impact on the demand for\ntemptation goods since it is assumed that villages that are close to urban areas could get\nthe tasty treat more easily. This could determine the impact of peer effect. We do not\nfind that the distance to the provincial capital or the district capital has any impact on\nthe peer effects and results found in Table 7 stay the same. We also control for a number\nof other village characteristics such as village shocks or their intensity. These also do not\nseem to make a difference.\nWe also check whether there are further personal characteristics that may influence\nthe demand for the tasty treat and the strength of the peer effect. We check if those\nthat have particularly high food consumption, low consumption or high consumption are\nmore likely to choose the tasty treat in higher rounds. This may either indicate being\nparticularly rich or poor or alternatively, those with high food consumption may have\na particular high demand for food. We find no effects using any of these consumption\nvariables. We also include an interaction term between the female dummy and the leave\nout mean to see if peer effects are stronger for men or women. We find no effect.\nIn the next step, we test whether our results may be driven by one or several settings\nof the experiment. We firstly investigate whether morning or afternoon sessions would\nhave a confounding effect on the demand of consumption good. We create an dummy\nvariable for the morning session and interaction terms thereof with the group average\nexcluding the individual and include this in our regression analysis (see Table 12). We\nonly look at those that played in observing peer groups. We find that there is no difference\nbetween results the game is played in the morning. Hence, main results of Table 7, Panel\nA, remain unchanged. It is interesting to see whether the experimental session influences\nthe results. In each village, we played two sessions. We find that whether the experiment\nwas performed in the first or the second session does not make a difference to the results\n(see Table 12). Taking the entire or merely the observing groups, we find that regardless\nwhether one group played before the other, peer observation seems to have an impact\non the consumption choice of the individual. Lastly, most of our groups contained five\npeople, however it was not always possible. We also check if group size has an effect on\nour results. In order to this we exclude all groups that did not contain five people. Again,\nwe find that results do not change.\nOverall, our results seem robust to a large number of alterations and controls to out-\ncome variables, village charactersitics, individual charactersitics and experimental design.\n7 Conclusion\nIn a standard economic model of consumption choice, the effect of peers is largely ignored.\nOur study shows that peer observation has an effect on consumption of temptation goods.\nWe conduct a lab-in-field experiment and find that peer observation leads to conformity.\nWe start by introducing a conceptual framework that introduces a cost if the individ-\nual makes a decision that deviates from that of the group. From this framework we can\nsee that the demand function of the temptation good is less steep under peer observation.\nWe can also derive a positive relationship between the average group choice and the indi-\nvidual choice.\nThe data supports the predictions of the conceptual framework. Due to the experimen-\ntal nature and the large number of control variables, we can circumvent the identification\nproblems normally associated in studies on peer effects. In the control group, respon-\ndents perform the experiment at the same time as their peers but without observing each\nother. In the treatment group, peers still make individual choices, but observe each other\nwhilst doing it. We find that standard deviations of those groups that observe each other\nare lower than for those groups that do not observe each other. At the same time, we\nshow that individual choices are higher when the group choice, measured as the leave-out\ngroup mean, is higher. Most importantly, we only observe this when the experiment is\nperformed with peer observations. Hence, we provide clear evidence of peer effects and\nconclude that peer observation leads to conformity.\nThis finding is in line with Falk and Ichino (2006) who find that the standard deviation\nof output of subjects in pairs is statistically significantly lower that in the single treat-\nment. It also corresponds to theoretical models of herding (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani\net al., 1992). The direction of our effects is in line with those of Bandiera et al.(2010),\nBursztyn et al. (2014) and de Giorgi et al. (2010) for positive and significant peer effects\non individual behavior.\nIn further analysis we look into the possible mechanism behind this conformity. We\nstudy the effect of familiarity with the product and find that peer observation can coun-\nteract the effect of a lack of knowledge of a product. We also find some evidence that\nrespondents follow the choices of their peer group. Finally, we investigate treatment het-\nerogeneities in order to see if the tendency to conform is stronger for some behavioral\ntraits or environments. We find that individuals with high cognitive ability, are less likely\nto choose the tasty treat, while the same effect is not to be found for overconfident or\nhigh-income individuals. We also find evidence that those that live in closer knit commu-\nnities are more likely to succumb to peer effects.\nDespite these findings, a lot of open questions remain that call for further research\ninto peer effects and its effect on consumption choices. So far, there is no consensus on\nthe \"best\" method to identify peer effects, in part because models and methods must\nnecessarily be case-specific. However, understanding the complexity of peer effects seems\nyet to be insufficiently explored. Furthermore, more research is needed that looks into\nthe mechanisms behind peer effects and what leads to conformity. In more detail, a\nstructured experiment may be able to disentangle the effect of information and network\nexternality and so explain why we find this conformity when peers observe each other. In\naddition, research should be done into the effect of key individuals within a group, that\nis to investigate who leads a group and who in a group follows. Another open question is\nwhether peer effects as they are found in this experiment would persist beyond the time\nof observation.\nTable 1: Summary Statistics of Individual and Village Characteristics\nVariable Mean Std.

At the end of the game you can keep either the tasty goods or\nthe money. We will ask you to choose between the two options 7 times. Each time we\nask you, we increase the amount of money. The amount of tasty goods will always be\nthe same. The enumerator will write down your choice each time we ask you. After the\ngame, we will draw a number from a bag. This determines which of the two options you\nget. The tasty good will be given to you straight after the game. The money, however,\nwill be given to you at the end of the whole survey. You will only receive one option.\nEither money or tasty good.\nExample: No.3 is drawn from the bag. For the third decision you chose the tasty\ntreat, so you will get the tasty treat immediately. Enumerator put tasty good on the table.\nEnumerator will present the tasty good and ask the following question.
