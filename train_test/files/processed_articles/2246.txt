Siegel2\n Introduction\nRecent data show that between 28% and 30% of U.S.\nadults use supplements containing vitamins A, C, and E,\nserum antioxidant levels have been associated with lower\noverall mortality risk (3\u00ad15), and fruit and vegetable\nintake (a rich source of antioxidants) has also been shown\nto predict better health outcomes in observational studies\n(16\u00ad20). In contrast, most randomized controlled trials\nhave either failed to show significant health benefits from\ntaking these supplements or reported possible harm. A\nrecent systematic review of 78 primary and secondary\nprevention trials by the Cochrane Collaboration conclud-\ned that use of b-carotene, vitamin E, or high doses of\nvitamin A supplements was associated with increased\nall-cause mortality, while the role of vitamin C or seleni-\num supplementation was not clear (21). Although the\nPhysicians' Health Study II (22) recently showed a small\nreduction in total cancer incidence with multivitamin\nsupplement use, most large clinical trials assessing cancer\nincidence or mortality have failed to show any beneficial\neffects of taking these supplements (23\u00ad29).\nMany authors have suggested that the reason for these\ndiscrepant findings is that antioxidants have different\neffects on various disease processes, and that beyond\na certain \"threshold\" level, they can be potentially toxic\n(30\u00ad40). Surprising little literature exists, however,\nexamining nonlinear effects between serum antioxidant\nnutrient levels and all-cause and cause-specific mortality\noutcomes. There are also few studies examining compet-\ning risks of mortality in the context of antioxidant nutrient\nuse.\nUsing data from The Third National Health and Nutri-\nnationally representative cohort of U.S. adults, we\nexamined whether serum levels of micronutrients with\nantioxidant properties (vitamins C and E, b-carotene, and\nAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University\nMailman School of Public Health and 2Departments of Medicine and\nSurgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New\nYork, New York\nNote: Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Epide-\nmiology, Biomarkers & Prevention Online (http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/).\nCorresponding Author: Abby B.

The\noverall sample size was 39,695; interview and examina-\ncipants (ages 20 years and above) who underwent\nparticipants for whom data on serum antioxidant nutri-\nent levels and vital status were available. Missing data\non covariates ranged from less than 1% to 8% of the study\nparticipants. In the analysis, we included only those indi-\nviduals with complete information available for these\ncovariates. NHANES III was approved by the Institution-\nal Review Board at the CDC. Written informed consent\nwas obtained from all study participants (43).\nMeasures\nOur primary exposures of interest were serum levels of\nvitamin A, and micronutrients with antioxidant proper-\nties. Levels of vitamin A (retinol), vitamin C, vitamin E\n(a-tocopherol), and b-carotene were measured by iso-\ncratic high-performance liquid chromatography (44).\nSerum selenium levels were measured with atomic\nabsorption spectrometry (44). NHANES III laboratory\nprocedures including quality control systems have been\ndescribed elsewhere (45).\nOur primary outcomes of interest were cause-specific\nand all-cause mortality. Mortality data were primarily\nobtained by probabilistic matching to the National Death\nIndex records using the 2010 public release version of the\nNHANES III Linked Mortality File (46). NHANES III also\nused various other sources of information to determine\nthe final mortality status and causes of death for survey\nparticipants including death certificates, Social Security\nAdministration data, and records from the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services. The 9th and 10th revi-\nsions of the International Statistical Classification of Dis-\neases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) were used to classify deaths due\nrefs. 46\u00ad48). Final mortality status was determined for\nmore than 99% of the study participants (46).\nStatistical analysis\nTo accommodate the complex survey design of\nNHANES III, we applied appropriate statistical weights\nin our analyses (42). Cox Proportional Hazards Models\nwere used to estimate the HRs, and the proportional-\nhazards assumption was tested using the Kolmogorov-\ntype supremum test (49). To examine whether the asso-\nciations had a dose\u00adresponse relationship, we modeled\nserum levels of antioxidants as quintiles, using the first\nquintile as the reference group.\nCovariates used in the analysis were selected a priori\nbased on their suspected roles as confounders. We first\nfit a basic model adjusted for age and gender (Model 1).\nFor multivariable analysis, Model 2 additionally included\nrace\u00adethnicity, education, income, body mass index\n(BMI), smoking status, serum cotinine levels, alcohol\nconsumption, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity,\nserum total cholesterol levels, hypertension status (sys-\ntolic or diastolic blood pressure 140 or 90 mm Hg,\nrespectively, use of antihypertensive drugs, or hyperten-\nsion medical history), diabetes mellitus status (glycosy-\nlated hemoglobin 6.5%, use of antidiabetic drugs, or\ndiabetes medical history), history of heart attack, conges-\ntive heart failure, stroke or cancer, hormone use among\nwomen (use of any estrogen or progesterone including\noral contraceptive pills in the past one month), and use of\nvitamin or mineral supplements (in the past one month).\nCategories of variables used in the analysis were consis-\ntent with the NHANES III survey design (42).\nAdditional analyses examined these associations in the\nfirst 5 or 10 years of follow-up, after excluding deaths\nwithin the first 3 years of the survey, and after excluding\ncurrent smokers. We also assessed the independent\neffects of these agents by adjusting for other micronutri-\nents in the multivariable models. Because systemic\ninflammatory response has been shown to affect plasma\nmicronutrient measurements, in an additional analysis,\nwe further adjusted for C-reactive protein levels (50).\nAs participants with self-reported history of comor-\nbidities may have changed their dietary habits and sup-\nplement usage, we conducted separate analyses after\nexcluding those with known history of heart attack,\ncongestive heart failure, stroke, or cancer. Finally, to\ninvestigate dose\u00adresponse associations using vitamin A\nand antioxidant nutrient levels as continuous variables,\nwe created restricted cubic spline functions for all-cause,\ncancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality outcomes\n(51). All analyses were done using SAS (Version 9.3;\nSAS Institute Inc.).\nResults\nmedian follow-up period of 14.2 years.

HRs for\ncancer and cardiovascular disease mortality are shown\nin Table 3.\nWe observed U-shaped associations between serum\nlevels of vitamins A and E, and all-cause mortality (Fig.\n1) with those with levels in Q1 or Q5 having higher\nmortality risks compared with those with levels in Q2\u00ad\nQ4. For vitamin A, risk of cancer death decreased from Q1\nto Q2, with no further decline in risk at higher levels,\nwhereas for vitamin E, having levels 26.08 mmol/L (Q4\u00ad\nQ5) were associated with the lowest cancer mortality risk.\nThe increased all-cause mortality risk for those with levels\nin Q5 for vitamin A was mainly driven by higher cardio-\nvascular disease mortality (Fig. 2), and for vitamin E, by\nhigher stroke mortality.\nFor vitamin C (Model 2), all-cause mortality risk\ndecreased with increases in serum levels from Q1 to Q4\n(Ptrend\n< 0.001) with no further decline in risk with higher\nlevels (60.19 mmol/L).

Cancer\nmortality risks decreased from Q1 to Q2 for b-carotene\nand from Q1 to Q4 for selenium. Beyond Q1, higher levels\nseemed to increase the cardiovascular disease mortality\nrisk for both b-carotene and selenium.\nTable 2.

Vitamin A and antioxidant nutrients such as\nvitamins C and E, b-carotene, and selenium have been\nhypothesized to prevent or delay this damage (56\u00ad61).\nConsequently, use of these agents is rising, and almost\n40% of U.S. adults take them for their perceived health\nIn this study, using data from a large, nationally rep-\nresentative cohort of 16,008 U.S. adults, we observed\nthreshold effects and nonlinear associations between\nserum levels of these micronutrients, and all-cause and\ncause-specific mortality outcomes. These results help to\nexplain some of the discrepant findings between the\nobservational studies and randomized trials about the\nrole of these agents on health outcomes.\nWe found that higher levels were generally associated\nwith a modest decrease in all-cancer mortality risk. How-\never, the most significant decline in risk was generally\nfrom the first to the second quintile. A number of high\nprofile trials assessing antioxidants as cancer prevention\nagents have failed to show significant mortality benefits\nwith taking these supplements (23\u00ad27) and some have\nreported possible harm (28, 29). A recent meta-analysis of\n22 primary and secondary prevention trials concluded\nthat there was no evidence to support preventive effects of\nany of the antioxidant supplements on any cancer type\nFigure 1.

The Physicians' Health Study II also recently showed\nonly a small reduction in total cancer incidence (HR \u00bc\nthan a decade of daily multivitamin use and follow-up\n(22). Furthermore, most of these large prevention trials\ndid not consider baseline nutrition level in their inclusion\nThe importance of assessing baseline nutritional status\nis underscored by the Linxian Study in China, which\nspecifically targeted a geographic area where subjects had\nchronically low blood levels of multiple micronutrients. It\nis the only prevention trial to our knowledge so far that\nhas reported statistically significant reductions in all-can-\noxidant supplementation (65).\nInterestingly, in the Physicians' Health Study I, there\nwas no decrease in total cancer incidence with b-carotene\nsupplementation. However, in subgroup analyses, lower\nbaseline b-carotene levels were associated with alcohol\nconsumption and higher BMI, and overall cancer inci-\ndence was modestly reduced with supplementation in\nthese subgroups (among daily alcohol drinkers, RR \u00bc 0.9;\nMAX trial, lower total cancer incidence (RR \u00bc 0.69;95% CI,\nto their lower baseline antioxidant status (27). Although\nsome of these results could be due to testing multiple\nhypotheses, the findings presented in our study as well as\nthe results from others examining a nutritionally deficient\npopulation further support the hypothesis that supple-\nmentation might only be useful for those who have low\nserum antioxidant levels, and that beyond a threshold,\nhigher levels do not lead to additional benefit, and may\npotentially be toxic.\nOur results also have broader implications for assessing\noverall mortality benefits from the use of dietary supple-\nments. For example, using antioxidant levels as continu-\nous variables, a study in the British National Diet and\nNutrition Survey found that higher levels of vitamin C,\nselenium, and b-carotene were associated with lower\noverall mortality risk (HR per SD for vitamin C \u00bc 0.81,\nwere not significant (HR for vitamin A \u00bc 0.96, P \u00bc 0.4;\nantioxidant levels as continuous variables, we would have\nobtained similar results. However, by assessing nonlinear\nassociations, we were able to show that for selenium and\nb-carotene, beyond the first quintile, there was no appar-\nent decrease in the mortality risk with higher levels (Fig.\n1). Moreover, we showed a U-shaped association between\nlevels of vitamins A and E, and all-cause mortality.\nThese results for overall mortality are also consistent\nwith the findings of the recent systematic review by the\nCochrane Collaboration, which concluded that supple-\nmentation with b-carotene, vitamin E, or high doses of\nvitamin A was associated with increased mortality risk,\nwhereas the role of vitamin C or selenium supplement\nuse was not clear (21). Figure 1 in our study shows that\nexcept for vitamin C, having antioxidant levels beyond\nthe first quintile did not lead to any further decrease in\nall-cause mortality risk. Moreover, for vitamins A and E,\nhigher levels increased the overall risk of death.\nOur study has a number of strengths compared with\nprevious studies. First, this is the largest study to date\nassessing serum vitamin A and antioxidant nutrient\nlevels, and cause-specific and all-cause mortality out-\ncomes. Therefore, instead of examining serum levels as\ncontinuous variables, we were able to divide them into\nquintiles, and assess threshold and nonlinear relation-\nships with mortality. Because of small sample sizes\nand/or short follow-up durations, most observational\nstudies have been unable to show such associations (3\u00ad\n15). Furthermore, NHANES III used a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of the U.S. population, and final mor-\ntality status was available for more than 99% of the\nparticipants, minimizing the possibility of selection bias.\nAssessing serum levels of these agents instead of using\ndietary history, along with standardized and validated\nlaboratory methods, reduced the potential for information\nbias. Finally, use of appropriate sampling weights in the\nanalysis helped to obtain statistical estimates similar to\nthose if the entire sampling frame (the United States) had\nbeen surveyed.\nOur study has several limitations. We tested multiple\nhypotheses. Therefore, results must be interpreted with\ncaution. We limited our analysis to vitamin A and anti-\noxidant nutrients that are commonly used as dietary\nsupplements. Other potential agents with antioxidant\nproperties such as zinc, lycopene, and other carotenoids\nneed further evaluation. As with any observational study,\nresidual confounding by socioeconomic status, lifestyle\nvariables, and other factors cannot be excluded. However,\nNHANES III assessed a large number of health-related\nvariables, which enabled us to control for many potential\nconfounders. Furthermore, we obtained different results\nfor different micronutrients as well as for different health\noutcomes. These findings would be difficult to explain\nentirely on the basis of residual confounding. In addition\nto assessing cardiovascular mortality, there are many\nother possible competing risks for mortality that we could\nhave assessed. We assessed cardiovascular mortality as an\nexample of potential different effects of antioxidants on\ndifferent disease processes.\nFinally, in this study, we used a single measurement of\nserum levels to assess long-term nutritional status. In\nour analysis (Supplementary Table S6), we observed sim-\nilar HRs for 5-year, 10-year, and for the entire duration\nof follow-up. This suggests that at the population level,\na single measurement of serum levels may provide\na reliable estimate of long-term antioxidant status. A\nmajor limitation of randomized trials assessing use of\nGoyal et al.\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 22(12) December 2013 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nsupplements for primary prevention is that the partici-\npants typically have to be kept on intervention for long\nperiods to significantly affect health outcomes. Therefore,\nobservational studies such as this mayfacilitate the assess-\nment of the relationship between long-term nutritional\nstatus and health outcomes.\nIn summary, using data from a nationally representa-\ntive cohort of more than 16,000 U.S. adults, we were able to\nidentify specific plasma levels of vitamin A and various\nantioxidant nutrients, which were associated with max-\nimum cancer-related and overall survival. We found that\nbeyond a certain threshold, there was generally no addi-\ntional benefit with higher serum levels with respect\nto overall mortality. Specifically, for vitamins A and E,\nhigher levels increased the overall mortality risk. These\ndata support the findings of recent randomized trials\nthat have generally failed to show health benefits with\nthat having low serum antioxidant nutrient levels was\nassociated with higher mortality risk, suggesting that\nsupplementation might still be useful for those who are\nnutritionally deficient.\nOur findings underscore the need to assess safety of\nthese agents like other drugs, rather than classifying them\nas \"dietary supplements,\" which affects their regulatory\noversight (67). Although the current Institute of Medicine\nguidelines provide recommended dietary allowances and\ntolerable upper intake levels for these agents, we also\nhighlight the potential significance of measuring serum\nlevels to guide their use as supplements (68). Novel\nintervention studies might then be planned where doses\nof these agents are individualized on the basis of serum\nlevels, lifestyle behaviors such as smoking which affect\nlevels, and possibly, markers of oxidative stress and\negy would help ensure that those who are deficient get the\nrequired micronutrients, while also preventing toxic\nlevels of antioxidants that could potentially lead to worse\nhealth outcomes.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\nAuthors' Contributions\nConception and design: A.
