To overcome\nthis shortcoming we integrated an objective indicator\nof physical failure with a subjective indicator of suffer-\ning before death to develop several categorisations of\nFirstly, we dichotomised separate variables into parti-\ncipants who were bedridden for fewer than 30 days\nbefore death and those who were bedridden for 30 or\nmoredays beforedeath. Testing othercut-off points for\nduration of being bedridden did not improve explana-\ntory power.\nSecondly, we dichotomised the subjective painful-\nness of death on the basis of an evaluation of the dece-\ndents' next of kin (peaceful v non-peaceful) reported in\nthe2005 survey. MostelderlypeopleinChina residein\nthe community,31 which provides the unique opportu-\nnity for next of kin to report on the participant's suffer-\ning immediately before death. Although both\nmeasures were ascertained from next of kin, research\nshows that surrogate responses from family members\nand others are appropriate for obtaining reliable infor-\nmation on the health status and quality of death among\nFinally, we grouped the two assessments of the par-\nticipants' last month of life to categorise the deaths as\nfollows: less than 30 bedridden days with suffering, less\nthan 30 bedridden days with no suffering, 30 or more\nbedridden days with suffering, or 30 or more bedrid-\nden days with no suffering. The reference category in\nthe multinomial regression models was survival over\nthe three years.\nFrailty index and confounding risks\nFrailty is a physiological state of non-specific vulner-\nability to stressors resulting from decreased physio-\nlogical reserves and the deregulation of multiple\nphysiological systems associated with advancing\nciation with specific diseases or disabilities but rather a\nsystemic manifestation of physical and cognitive defi-\ncits, including the signs, symptoms, illnesses, and\nimpairments that accumulate over the life course.8 37\nEmpirically, a variety of methods have been used to\nquantify frailty, although the most common applica-\ntions are the phenotypic approach and the frailty\nindex.38 39 The phenotypic approach defines frailty on\nthe basis of several items, such as weight loss, exhaus-\ntion, weakness, slowness, or low physical activity, and\nconsiders any three conditions as an indication of\nfrailty.5 Alternatively, a frailty index focuses less on\nthe specific deficits of people and more on the cumula-\ntive number of health deficiencies.8 15 Despite the simi-\nlarities between these approaches, the choice of\nmeasurement is often dictated by the clinical outcome\nunder investigation. Accordingly, recent research\nshows that frailty indices are more applicable for study-\ning mortality than are phenotypic methods.8 38 39 In\npractice, most studies compute a frailty index as the\nproportion of cumulative health deficits to all possible\ndeficits for a given individual.17\nFollowing earlier research, we constructed a frailty\nindex using 39 variables that included objective, sub-\njective, and proxy reports of cognitive functioning, dis-\nability, auditory and visual ability, depression, heart\nrhythm, and numerous chronic diseases (details\nMen\nPercentage\n<30 bedridden days with no suffering\n<30 bedridden days with suffering\n>30 bedridden days with no suffering\n>30 bedridden days with suffering\nAge (years)\nWomen\nPercentage\nFig 1 | Observed proportion of type of death among deceased\nlongitudinal healthy longevity survey\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 11 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nTable 1 | Characteristics of men in 2002 wave of Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey by level of frailty.

These results\nshowed that as long as we included variables character-\nising each of the major domains of health (activities of\ndaily living, instrumental activities of daily living,\nchronic illnesses, and cognitive functioning), the pat-\ntern of frailty with age remained consistent. In the Chi-\nnese longitudinal healthy longevity survey, levels of\nfrailty increased exponentially from ages 65 to 100\nand then levelled off (results not shown); therefore we\nsplit the frailty index into fourths for men and for\nwomen to account for non-linear relations between\nlevels of frailty and type of death.\nTo obtain robust estimates we also adjusted analyses\nfor several previously identified confounding factors.40\nVarious coding strategies were assessed for each\nmeasure and the results were similar; therefore, we\ndichotomised all of the confounding variables (except\nage). Measures of demographic background included\nminorities,andthose livinginurbanareas. Measures of\nsocioeconomic status included education (any formal\neducation), primary lifetime occupation as a white col-\nlar worker, economic independence (primary financial\nsource from own work or pension), family in good eco-\nnomic standing (self rated as rich compared with other\nfamilies in the community), and being in receipt of ade-\nquate drugs for any illnesses. Social contact and sup-\nport measures included current marital status, close\nproximity to children (coresiding with biological or\nadopted children, including a spouse's child, or having\none or more biological children living in the same vil-\nlage or street block), and religious activity almost every\nday or sometimes. Measures for health practices\nincluded exercising on a regular basis and having\never smoked in the past five years.\nStatistical analysis\nWe computed sample distributions of the study vari-\nables separately by sex and level of frailty. To test dif-\nferences in the distributions of frailty for dichotomous\nvariables we used Kendall's  tests and for categorical\nvariables Pearson's 2 tests. Multinomial logistic\nregression models were used to estimate the relative\nrisk ratios and 95% confidence intervals associated\nwith levels of frailty and the four types of death. We\nused two sets of nested regression models to adjust\nfor the confounding risk factors. The first set of ana-\nlyses tested the effects of frailty by sex while adjusting\nfor basic personal information (age, ethnicity, and\nurban residence). In the second set of analyses we\nincluded the additional confounding variables for\nsocioeconomic status, social contact and support, and\nhealth practices. We then computed the predicted pro-\nportionsof thetypes of death (amongdecedents) across\nage and frailty for men and for women.\nAll analyses were done using Stata version 10.1.\nOverall, few data were missing for study variables\n(<4%), and we used multiple imputation methods to\ncorrect for missing values on the individual\nmeasures.41 Research shows that including variables\nrelated to sample selection produces unbiased esti-\nmates in the absence of weights42 and our preliminary\nanalyses showed that the pattern of findings was con-\nsistent with those based on weighted data.

A greater proportion of\nwomen than men had 30 or more bedridden days\neither with or without suffering before death. Those\nwith the most frailty had the highest rates for all types\nof death. Men with the most frailty were more likely to\nsuffer before death (17.9% with <30 bedridden days,\nwomen, who were more likely to experience no suffer-\ning before death (25.4% with <30 bedridden days, and\n21.1% with 30 bedridden days), especially after at\nleast 30 bedridden days.\nAlthough men had a slightly younger age distribu-\ntion (and death rates) than women, both sexes exhib-\nited commensurate increases in age across levels of\nfrailty. Similar proportions of men and women were\nfrom ethnic minority groups (about 6%) and lived in\nurban areas (about 43%); however, men and women\nfrom ethnic minority groups were less frail than those\nof Han ethnicity. There was no trivariate difference\nbetween sex, frailty, and urban residence. At nearly\nall levels of frailty men had higher socioeconomic sta-\ntus, were more likely to be married, took regular exer-\ncise, and had smoked in the past five years compared\nwith women. Women were more likely to live close to\ntheir children and engage in religious activities com-\npared with men. For both sexes, socioeconomic status,\nsocial contacts and support, and exercise declined\nacross levels of frailty. Conversely, the proportion of\nparticipants who smoked was lower for men and\nwomen with higher levels of frailty.\nFor both sexes the proportion of participants who\ndid not suffer before death increased with age and the\nproportion who suffered decreased with age (figs 1 and\n2). Across levels of frailty, the most pronounced pat-\nterns were the precipitous declines in the numbers of\nparticipants who experienced fewer than 30 bedridden\ndays with suffering and increases in the number of par-\nticipants who experienced 30 or more bedridden days\nwith no suffering, particularly among women. Consis-\ntent with tables 1 and 2, the plotted probabilities also\nindicated that women were more likely to experience\nno suffering before death compared with men.\nTable 3 presents the results from the multinomial\nanalyses for the associations between frailty and type\nof death for men and women.

In terms of the type of death, the results indicated\nthat frailty increased the risk of dying with some obser-\nvable suffering for men and increased the risk of being\nbedridden for fewer than 30 days or for 30 or more\ndays with no suffering for women. For example,\nwomen in the highest fourth of the frailty index were\ntimes (7.8 to 17.0) more likely to experience no suffer-\ning before death compared with survival, respectively.\nThe corresponding rates among men were 4.0 (3.4 to\nrisks for experiencing fewer than 30 bedridden days\nor 30 or more bedridden days with suffering among\nmost frailty. Thus the observed sex differences in the\nproportions of death (figs 1 and 2) were supported in\nthe multivariate relative risk models.\nTables 4 and 5 present the predicted proportions of\nthe types of death by age, frailty, and sex from table 3\n(model 2). Overall, the most common type of death for\nmen and women in the Chinese longitudinal healthy\nlongevity survey was characterised by 30 or fewer bed-\nridden days with no suffering. Given the same level of\nfrailty and adjusting for confounders, the proportion of\nmen who experienced suffering and 30 or more bed-\nridden days before death was greater than the propor-\ntion of men bedridden with no suffering before death;\nhowever, the opposite was found among women. Ana-\nlyses further indicated that the oldest men and women\n(90 years) were more likely to experience fewer bed-\nridden days with no suffering before death than their\nyounger counterparts. The results also showed that\nfewer than 30 bedridden days with no suffering before\ndeath were more common than 30 or more bedridden\ndays with no suffering, whereas fewer than 30 bedrid-\nden days with suffering were more common than 30 or\nmore bedridden days with suffering for each sex and\nage group. Moreover, being bedridden for fewer than\n30 days or for 30 or more days with suffering was less\nprevalent with increasing age compared with being\nbedridden for fewer than 30 days or 30 or more days\nwith no suffering, which was especially apparent for\nthe most frail participants.\nHigher levels of frailty among men were associated\nwith greater proportions of death with 30 or more bed-\nridden days and with lesser proportions of death with\nfewer than 30 bedridden days for every age group.\nAmong women, being bedridden for fewer than\n30 days with suffering decreased and being bedridden\nfor 30 or more days with no suffering increased across\nall levels of frailty within each age group; however,\ndifferences were modest for experiencing fewer than\n30 bedridden days with no suffering and 30 or more\nbedridden days with suffering across levels of frailty.\nDISCUSSION\nResults based on a prospective cohort of adults aged 65\nto 109 in China showed that higher levels of frailty\nincreased the risk of experiencing all four types of\ndeath that we examined: being bedridden for fewer\nthan 30 days with or with no suffering or being bed-\nridden for 30 or more days with or with no suffering.\nPeople with greater frailty were more likely to experi-\nence a greater number of bedridden days before death\nthan those with less frailty.

Overall,\nthe results provided strong evidence that cumulative\ndeficits, quantified with a frailty index, influenced not\nonly the likelihood of dying but also the quality of life\nOverall, compared with men, women exhibited\nhigher risks of experiencing one of the four types of\ndeath as levels of frailty increased, owing to their\nolder age and therefore increased physiological frailty.\nEvidence from Western nations and China concur that\nolder women are often in poorer health yet live longer\nthan men.44 45 The implications of this finding are per-\nhapsmorepronouncedindevelopingcountriessuchas\nChina. In many cases, Chinese women bear a dispro-\nportionate amount of the care giving to spouses and\ntheir respective parents. These women also have the\nfewest economic and familial resources and exhibit\nthe most frailty as they age. Future research should\ninvestigate ways to reduce the excess risks of dying\nrelated to frailty by minimising the causes and conse-\nquences of declining physiological reserves, particu-\nlarly among women. Despite these disadvantages our\nresults showed that for men the risks increased most\nnoticeably for deaths with suffering, whereas for\nwomen the risks increased much more for every level\nof frailty for deaths with no suffering. This is consistent\nwith studies from the West.46 47 Research suggests that\nelderly women are less likely to afford or use life sus-\ntaining treatments and instead rely on care from\nhospices48-50 and alternative modes of emotional and\nspiritual care during the dying process,51 which may\nminimise the degree of subjective suffering.\nThat extremely old men and women in our study\n(90 years) were less likely to suffer before death sup-\nports research from younger samples in hospice and\nclinical settings in North America.47 52 The lack of suf-\nfering among extremely old people may be due to the\nprecipitous withdrawal of life sustaining treatments,53\nthat such people are psychologically or genetically\nrobust and less likely to express pain or\ndiscomfort,54 55 or that because participants and their\nfamilies had sufficient time to prepare for death their\nperception of suffering might have been overlooked or\nexpected.56 These speculations are, however, cautious\nand we encourage research to verify our results. None-\ntheless, it seems that subjective assessments of the qual-\nity of death at the upper limits of age share a common\nexpectation and convey a universal respect for longev-\nity regardless of the population or culture.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nA major strength of this research is the application of a\ncomprehensive measure of frailty in a large scale pro-\nspective sample. The results showed that the frailty\nindex had a significant impact on the type of death\nexperienced by older adults and underscored a critical\naspect of the quality of dying that is often overlooked in\ncohort studies. The current findings add to an increas-\ning body of evidence showing that frailty indices are\nvalid indicators for quantifying ageing and predicting\nnificant correlation between frailty index levels and the\ntime to death in the absence of a relation between\nchronological age and time to death.14 Research has\nalso shown that a frailty index correlated with death\nbetter than did chronological age, especially within\nshort intervals (for example, <4 years).8 Another\nrecent study showed that a cumulative deficits\napproach (frailty index) was more effective than a phe-\nnotypic approach in predicting susceptibility to\ndeath.39 Our sensitivity analyses closely replicated\nage-sex distributions in frailty indices in other\nfident about the validity of our frailty measure.\nTable 5 | Predicted proportions* of type of death among deceased women in Chinese\nlongitudinal healthy longevity survey by age and frailty\nVariables\nType of death\ndays, no suffering\ndays, suffering\ndays, no suffering\ndays, suffering\nfourths\nAge \nFrailty fourth:\nFrailty fourth:\nFrailty fourth:\nFrailty fourth:\nAge \nFrailty fourth:\n*Adjusted for age, ethnicity, urban residence, socioeconomic status, social contact and support, and health\npractices.\nRESEARCH\npage 8 of 11 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nNevertheless, several limitations of this study war-\nrant further attention. Although we made great efforts\nto validate the frailty index, we encourage research to\ndevelop and test other quantifications of frailty.\nUndoubtedly as our understanding of physiological\npathways increases, we expect future studies to con-\ntinue to refine measures of frailty and extend the cur-\nrent research, which assumes equal item weight and\nexcludes important indicators of immune function and\nAnother limitation is that our longitudinal measures\nof the types of death include only two domains of the\nquality of dying previously identified in the\nliterature.21 59 Although the qualitative assessment of\nsuffering before death is a key dimension of quality of\ndeath, the measure of suffering in the Chinese longitu-\ndinal healthy longevity survey was ascertained from\nthe decedents' next of kin and may be biased. This is\nbecause some research shows that proxy reports are\nnot always consistent with reports by individuals\nbefore their death.60 Nonetheless, future studies should\nexamine other assessments of suffering before dying as\nwell as different sources and subjective dimensions of\nthe types of death faced by older adults.36 A final con-\nrandom and may have introduced bias in our esti-\nmates. However, supplementary analyses indicated\nthat the general patterns and conclusions of our analy-\nsis did not change regardless of whether we para-\nmeterised the lost sample as a categorical outcome or\nimputed the missing cases.\nClinical and policy implications\nDespite these limitations our results provide a broader\nunderstanding of the association between frailty and\nquality of death and may have implications for clinicians,\nindividuals, and public health. In medical settings, cura-\ntive treatments are often eclipsed in moderate to extreme\ncases of frailty by palliative care in efforts to reduce dis-\ncomfort and enhance the quality of life before death. The\nclinical application of a checklist (or index) for frailty can\nbe a useful diagnostic tool that helps to characterise a\npatient's biological age compared with their chronologi-\ncal age, although unlike the phenotypic approach the\nfrailty index may need translation in clinical practice for\nspecific treatments.38 39 Accordingly, implementing such\nmeasures may improve a doctor's repertoire for deter-\nmining appropriate treatments and perhaps intervening\natpreclinicalstagesoffrailtyorbeforephenotypiccriteria\nare detectable, especially for extremely old adults.39 61\nFrom an individual's standpoint it is also imperative\nto identify the manifestations and levels of frailty to\nspecialise end of life care, minimise suffering, and pro-\nmote a peaceful death. Our findings suggest that the\nmedical care of older adults should be tailored to the\nage specific and sex specific levels of frailty that were\nshown to influence one's susceptibility to preventable\nsuffering before dying. For example, low levels of\nfrailty due to functional decline could be targeted\nwith appropriate exercise regimens that also prevent\nor delay the onset of additional frailty from other latent\nand treatable deficits (for example, cognitive decline).\nIn other words, health practitioners should utilise the\ngenerality of a frailty index while recognising the indi-\nvidual differences in cumulative deficits and the chan-\nging dynamics of health and care in late ages.62 63\nOur findings have potential implications for improv-\ning China's public healthcare system. China is the\nworld's largest developing country and is currently\nfacing unique challenges to its healthcare system as\nan unbalanced population structure and a rapidly age-\ning population is straining the traditional family\noriented system of care. We believe that the present\nstudy is an important step towards identifying frailty\nand its association with the quality of death in a rapidly\ndeveloping nation. However, more research is needed\nto address how medical expenditures and facilities can\nbe best utilised for patients at the end of their life and to\nreduce the escalating burden of frailty for family care\ngivers in the context of China's unique healthcare\nstructure. We hope that our findings facilitate more\ndiscussion and analysis of effective measures for end\nof life care and the advancement of community based\ncare resources that are largely undeveloped in China.\nContributors: MED and DG contributed equally and are listed as the first\nand corresponding author.
