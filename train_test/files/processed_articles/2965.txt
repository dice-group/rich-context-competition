Analysis of the as-\nsociation between income and use of mental health ser-\nvices was carried out for the population that was between\nages 18 and 54 years. Differential use of mental health\ntreatment was examined in 3 sectors: the general medi-\ncal sector, the specialty sector, and the human services\nsector.\nResults: No significant association between income and\nprobability of any mental health treatment was ob-\nserved for persons with psychiatric disorders in any of\nthe 3 countries. However, there were significant differ-\nences among countries in the association between in-\ncome and sector of mental health care treatment. In the\nUnited States, income is positively related to treatment\nbeing received in the specialty sector and negatively re-\nlated to treatment being received in the human services\nsector. In the Netherlands, patients in the middle-\nincome bracket are less likely to receive specialty care,\nwhile those in the high-income bracket are less likely to\nbe seen in the human service sector. Income is unre-\nlated to the sector of care for patients in Ontario.\nConclusions: Future research should examine whether\ndifferential access to the specialty sector for low-income\npeople in the United States is associated with worse men-\ntal health outcomes.\nhealth care within a country--\nguaranteeing that those in need\nreceive services independently of\nthe person's ability to pay1--is in-\ncreasingly relevant as national policies seek\nto modify disease outcomes.2 However,\nthere is considerable cross-national\nvariation in how the organization and\nfinancing of mental health services are\ndesigned to provide equity in access and\nquality of treatment. Some countries,\nsuch as Turkey, have failed to develop a\nspecial health care program for the\npoor,3 while others, such as the United\nStates, have developed separate health\ncare programs for those unable to pay.4\nStill other countries, such as Canada,\nhave established universal health insur-\nance plans explicitly designed to provide\nequality in the opportunity for treatment\nregardless of ability to pay.5\nThe US system has been criticized for\nbeing inherently inequitable.6,7 People in\ndifferent income strata are seen as segre-\ngated into separate sectors believed to dif-\nfer in type and quality of care.6,7 Consis-\ntent with this criticism, research has shown\nthat low-income people in the United\nStates have comparatively low rates of\ntreatment for mental disorders8,9 and are\nless likely than their economically advan-\ntaged counterparts to be treated by men-\ntal health specialists.10,11 These findings are\nespecially disturbing given that need for\ntreatment is higher among low-income\npeople than in the rest of the popula-\ntion,12,13 and that those with reported men-\ntal disorders seem to experience signifi-\ncant barriers to the receipt of needed\nThe United States, Canada, and the\nNetherlands vary in how their health care\nsystems are organized and financed to pro-\nvide equitable access in health and men-\ntal health services.

The poor received mental health care either through\nstate public mental health programs in community clin-\nics or through independent specialty providers paid\nthrough Medicaid coverage.17\nOntario18 has universal health insurance coverage\navailable to residents through a government-sponsored\nsingle-payer system explicitly designed to equalize ac-\ncess to treatment. Mental health services are provided by\nphysicians19 (such as family physicians20) reimbursed by\ngovernment in a fee-for-service modality or by psycholo-\ngists and social workers employed by government-\nfunded mental health centers.21 The system places no lim-\nits on inpatient stays or outpatient visits for mental health\ncare, but does apply supply-side controls to limit use.22\nDespite Canada's universal access system, recent evalu-\nations suggest problems of access22,23 and greater use of\nspecialist services for medical care among high-income\nIn the Netherlands,25 every person subject to Dutch\nincome taxation is covered by the Exceptional Medical\nExpenses Act, funded by a compulsory premium; ben-\nefits include comprehensive psychiatric care.

The focus of this report is on dis-\norders and outpatient treatment during the 12 months pre-\nvious to the interview.\nThe sample for each of the 3 surveys was based on a\nmultistage area-probability design in which a single re-\nspondent was selected for interview in each sampled house-\nhold. Weights were imposed on the data to adjust for dif-\nferential probabilities of selection and, in the NCS, for\ndifferential response. Although rates of psychiatric mor-\nbidity in the NCS were higher among nonresponders, the\noverall morbidity rates were not substantially affected by\nthe adjustment for nonresponse. Response rates were 82.4%\nNEMESIS. Given that the age ranges of the samples dif-\nfered, all the analyses reported herein are limited to re-\nspondents in the age range of 18 to 54 years.\nDiagnoses are based on the Composite International Di-\nagnostic Interview (CIDI),32 a fully structured research di-\nagnostic interview designed for use by trained interview-\ners who do not have clinical experience. Twelve CIDI\ndisorders were considered: mood disorders (major depres-\nsion, dysthymia, and mania); anxiety disorders (general-\nized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, simple phobia, so-\ncial phobia, and agoraphobia); and substance use disorders\n(abuse of or dependence on either alcohol or drugs). The\nWorld Health Organization CIDI Field Trials33 and an NCS\nclinical reappraisal study34 documented good reliability and\nvalidity for all of these diagnoses other than mania.35\nAll respondents, independent of symptoms, were asked\nwhether they had ever seen a professional for problems with\ntheir mental health. Positive responses were followed by in-\nquiries on the recency of treatment (use of outpatient ser-\nvices in the last year) and the types of professionals seen. The\nNCSand theSupplementassessedserviceusebyasking,\"Did\nyou ever in your lifetime go to see any of the professionals in\nthis list [the lists were identical except that the NCS added\nprograms provided in jails, prisons, and drop-in centers as\noptions] for problems with your emotions, nerves, or your\nuse of alcohol or drugs?\" The NEMESIS asked, \"I will list a\nnumber of persons or agencies where people can go for help.\nDid you ever in your lifetime go to see [providers were as-\nsessed by separate yes/no questions] for psychological prob-\nlems or alcohol or drug-related problems of your own?\" The\nwording of questions varied, but was sufficiently similar to\nallow parallel coding of information as to whether treat-\nment was obtained in each of 3 service sectors: general medi-\ncal, specialty, and human services. The main differences be-\ntween the lists were that NEMESIS excluded cardiologists,\ngynecologists, and other physicians and instead asked about\ncompany physicians, added crisis centers as another option,\nand combined psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychothera-\npists under 1 question.\nAny mental health treatment was defined as 1 or more\nvisits to a professional for a mental health problem. Gen-\neral medical sector was defined as mental health treatment\nby a medical physician other than a psychiatrist, regard-\nless of setting, or as treatment by an ancillary health pro-\nfessional (eg, nurse), excluding social worker and coun-\nselor, in any non\u00admental health setting. Specialty sector was\ndefined as mental health treatment by a psychiatrist, psy-\nchologist, or psychotherapist, or as treatment by any pro-\nfessional in a specialty mental health setting (eg, psychi-\natric outpatient clinic). Human services sector was defined\nas mental health treatment received in a social or welfare\nservice agency or by a social worker or counselor in any\nsetting other than a specialty setting.\nINCOME\nTotal family income was assessed by parallel questions in\nthe 3 surveys. The NCS asked, \"Please tell me which [of a\nseries of categories presented on a card] represents your\ntotal household income before taxes last year, including sala-\nries, wages, social security, welfare, and any other in-\ncome?\" The Supplement asked, \"What is your best esti-\nmate of your household income from all sources in 1990\nbefore income tax deductions?\" The NEMESIS phrased the\nquestion as, \"We would like to compare the results of this\nsurvey with the incomes of the Dutch population.

In the Netherlands, for the 35%\nof the people who are not covered either by the Social\nHealth Insurance Act or by specific plans for public\nemployees, private health insurance is an available\noption. Patients getting outpatient mental health pay a\nfixed fee per visit. Thus, a fee-for-service structure for\nthe higher-income population and a capitated system\nfor the lower-income population coexist.23 Social and\npsychiatric services are stratified so that specialty men-\ntal health care usually requires referrals from general\npractitioners, who retain an integral role in the mental\nhealth care of the patient.26 The Netherlands also has a\nbroad concept of mental health that encompasses psy-\nchosocial problems,27 and additional policies regarding\nhealth promotion and disease prevention, such as out-\nThe purpose of the current report is to present com-\nparative results on the relationship between income and\nmental health treatment in 3 countries that have fairly\ndifferent systems of organization and financing of health\ncare: the United States, the Netherlands, and the prov-\nince of Ontario, Canada. This report takes advantage of\nthe general-population epidemiological surveys con-\nducted in these 3 sites, using parallel sample designs and\nwhy it is important for us to have information about the\ntotal income of your household per month [transformed\nto annual household income]. Can you indicate which cat-\negory corresponds with the total income per month of your\nhousehold?\"\nCareful consideration was given to select the most ap-\npropriate way to define income groups for purposes of com-\nparison. Simply translating the 3 currencies into a common\ncurrency (such as dollars) on the basis of exchange rates does\nnot take into account the variable purchasing power of a dol-\nlar in each site. A comparison of percentages ignores the fact\nthat the lowest 10% in one site may be richer than the low-\nest 10% in another site. A comparison of the standardized\nincome distributions has the undesirable effect of assuming\nthat the means and variances of all sites are equal. Sensitiv-\nity analyses were performed with several income defini-\ntions. Given that our primary purpose was to identify people\nin other countries who were comparable with people in the\n4 quartiles in the United States, we established the quartiles\nbased on the US income distribution. We also investigated\nthe effect of income across service use by defining income\ngroupsbasedonthequartilesofincomeineachcountrysepa-\nrately, guaranteeing 25% of the population in each group in\neach country. The results were uniformly in the direction\nof diluting the differences between sites by income. We be-\nlieve this is because the lowest income quartile in Ontario\nor the Netherlands contains many \"nonpoor\" and the high-\nest quartile many \"nonrich\" in these countries with more\negalitarian distributions of income. This set of results led us\nto use absolute rather than relative income as the method\nfor comparing Ontario and the Netherlands with the United\nStates.\nTotal family income was therefore coded in 4 catego-\nries based on the income distribution in the United States.\nFor the United States, these categories were formed from\nNetherlands, income was converted to US dollars and 4 cat-\negories were created using the same income cutpoints as\nin the United States. While this constrains the distribu-\ntion of income across categories in the United States, it places\nno constraints on the distribution in Ontario and the Neth-\nerlands.\nThree sociodemographic control variables available across\ndata sets and found to be associated with mental health\nservice use36,37 were considered: age, sex, and marital sta-\nmously (male or female). Marital status was coded cat-\negorically as married, never married, and previously mar-\nried (ie, separated, divorced, or widowed). Given the\ndifferences in health care structures, insurance data were\nnot comparable across sites.\nDifferences in psychiatric morbidity and severity of\nillness by country may account for differences in the\nresponse of utilization patterns to income. Therefore,\npsychiatric morbidity was operationalized as the pres-\nence or absence of any of the assessed psychiatric disor-\nders and as the recency of such disorders, ranging from\nno long-term disorder to 2 or more disorders lasting at\nSite-specific cross-tabulations were computed to study\npsychiatric disorders and treatment use and the gross\nassociations between income and treatment. Logistic\nregression analysis was then used to adjust for age, sex,\nmarital status, and psychiatric morbidity in estimating the\nnet associations between income and treatment. Differen-\ntial willingness to report income across surveys (refusal\nrate was 8.0% in the NCS, 15.4% in the Supplement, and\n4.7% in NEMESIS) was controlled by adding a dummy\nvariable to distinguish respondents who refused to report\ntheir income from other respondents. Regression-based\nimputation38 was used to assign income values to NCS\nrespondents with missing scores. Missing values were not\nimputed in the other 2 surveys. Imputing values for miss-\ning data influences only the SEs and does not introduce\nbias into the point estimates. Pooled analyses with inter-\naction terms were used to test the significance of between-\nsite differences in the associations of income with treat-\nment.\nThe SEs of prevalence estimates and of logistic\nregression coefficients were computed using the method\nof jackknife repeated replications to adjust for the design\neffects introduced by clustering and weighting of observa-\ntions.39 The significance of differences between pairs of\ncoefficients was evaluated with z tests based on these cor-\nrected SEs. The significance of differences among larger\nsets of coefficients was evaluated with Wald 2 tests based\non jackknife repeated replication coefficient variance-\ncovariance matrices.

Drawing from this comparative analysis of\nmental health care use across 3 countries may lead us to\nobservations of how national policies may achieve eq-\nuity in mental health care use.\nThe present study addresses 2 questions: (1) Are\nthere site differences in the probability of receiving any\noutpatient mental health treatment by income among\npeople with mental disorders assessed in these surveys?\nWe expected that in the United States (before managed\ncare) mental health service use would be higher by per-\nsons at the extreme ends of the income distribution, equal\nfor the poor and nonpoor in Ontario, and lower for the\nwealthy in the Netherlands. (2) Are there cross-national\ndifferences in the association between income and sec-\ntor in which treatment is received? Several differences\nwere expected. In the United States, we expected pro-\nportional use of the specialty sector to be lower among\nlow-income people. In Ontario, sector of care was not\nexpected to vary by income strata. The Netherlands was\nexpected to have a higher use of the general health sec-\ntor for all income groups except for the high-income\ngroup.\nRESULTS\nAs shown in Table 1, there were significant between-\nsite differences in the 12-month prevalence of having at\nleast 1 psychiatric disorder assessed (29.1% in the United\nThere were also significant differences across sites in the\nestimated probabilities of any 12-month mental health\ntreatment (referred to as any treatment in this article), as\nshown in the table.

The odds ratios (ORs) comparing\ndisorder prevalence in the lowest vs highest income cat-\negories vary only modestly across sites, from 2.2 in the\nNetherlands to 1.5 in Ontario.

There was no significant income-treatment\nassociation in either subsample (no disorder or any\ndisorder) in Ontario.

Furthermore, the CIDI's lack of measurements of\nsyndrome severity, distress, or impairment could ex-\nplain some of the between-site differences in rates of treat-\nment. Research has shown that these dimensions are more\nimportant than dichotomous diagnostic classifications in\ndetermining help-seeking behaviors.40-43 Finally, while we\nused income as a proxy for economic access, it may be a\nproxy for other factors, such as differential perceived need\nfor treatment,44 differential readiness to use treatment,45\nand differential attitudes about physicians.36\nWithin the context of these limitations, however,\nmany of the results are in agreement with previous stud-\nies and highlight the remarkable pattern of consistency\nacross sites.

Some alter-\nnate explanations include the Netherlands' unique tradi-\ntion of primary-care outreach and screening for mental\nhealth problems,26 or their differential knowledge of,\npositive attitudes toward, and reduced stigma associated\nwith mental health care.37\nTable 4.

All rights reserved.\nThe distribution of patients across the service sec-\ntors also differed by site and led to important insights into\nthe sites' differences in mental health care organization.\nThe dramatically higher proportion of patients treated\nby the general medical sector in Ontario (two thirds) and\nthe Netherlands (three fourths) compared with the United\nStates (one third) confirms that the primary care physi-\ncian served a stronger gatekeeper function in the former\n2 sites. Furthermore, the significantly lower proportion\nof patients seen in the human services sector in the Neth-\nerlands and Ontario suggests that family physicians in\nCanada20 and general practitioners in the Netherlands26\nmay more commonly undertake these social and psychi-\natric services. Given the greater percentage of people in\npoverty in the United States, there might be a greater need\nthan in the other sites to structure a more defined hu-\nman services sector.\nWithin the individual sites, no significant associa-\ntion was found between income and probability of ob-\ntaining any treatment, suggesting that, contrary to the\nproposed hypothesis, each system provides some type of\nmental health care to its citizens, regardless of their abil-\nity to pay. Because many of these services are offered out-\nside the specialty sector, however, such findings may not\nhold true under more strict criteria regarding receipt of\nmental health treatment.\nIn contrast, specification analyses across sites re-\nvealed an association between income and treatment in\nthe data from respondents who did not meet criteria for\nany of the assessed disorders. Their responses showed\nboth a positive income-treatment trend in the United\nStates and a negative trend in the Netherlands. Indeed,\nwhen care is discretionary, attitudinal and propensitychar-\nacteristics of the person may interact with the organiza-\ntion and financing of the services to increase or reduce\nthe likelihood of seeking mental health treatment. One\nplausible interpretation is that, in contrast to Ontario, bar-\nriers to treatment among people with low need for ser-\nvices in the United States may be primarily financial. The\ndecreased access to treatment among high-income re-\nspondents with low need in the Netherlands probably re-\nflects the fact that Social Health Insurance is not avail-\nable to Dutch residents in the top third of the income\ndistribution and disposable income might not be com-\nparable with that in the United States.\nIn addition, a significant between-site difference was\nalso found for income and specialty care. High-income\nUS patients are significantly more likely to obtain spe-\ncialty sector treatment, while low-income patients are sig-\nnificantly more likely to receive treatment in the human\nservices sector. These results reflect financial barriers to\nspecialty care for the poor in the United States, barriers\nnonexistent within the universal insurance system in On-\ntario. These findings raise concerns about the quality and\ncontent of care received by low-income patients, a criti-\ncism of the US system. Although more research is needed\nto support these claims, available evidence is consistent\nportions of depressed patients in the United States and\nOntario who receive adequate medication treatment are\nmuch higher among those treated by psychiatrists than\namong those treated by primary care physicians.44 Our\nfindings suggest that social class may limit the type of\ncare patients receive in specialties other than mental health\ncare.
