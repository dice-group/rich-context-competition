Previous studies have demon-\nstrated that injury of the PCL increases\nknee instability, leading to articular carti-\nlage damage, meniscus injury, and osteoar-\nthritis.2\u00ad4 In general, the incidence of PCL\ninjury is lower than that of anterior cruciate\nligament (ACL) injury because PCL injury\noccurs only when the knee is bent at the\ntime the trauma occurs. However, in the\nareas of uneven terrain in Eastern China\nand rural regions of this part of the country,\nsimple PCL injuries are very common, with\nmost injuries caused by motorbike traffic\naccidents. For decades, arthroscopy has\nbeen the most popular technique in PCL\nreconstruction because of its various advan-\ntages, including a small incision and wide\nfield of vision. However, different studies\nof long-term outcomes after arthroscopic\nPCL reconstruction have reported disparate\nresults without uniform findings.5,6 For\nexample, some patients showed no distinct\nimprovement in knee stability after sur-\ngery.4 To clarify this issue, the present\nstudy investigated the long-term outcomes\nin 58 patients who underwent arthroscopic\nour hospital.\nMethods\nPatients\nThis case series is reported in line with the\nPROCESS guidelines.7 The patients includ-\ned in this study were hospitalized in the\nDepartment of Sport Injury and\nArthroscopy of the First Affiliated\nHospital of Anhui Medical University\napproved by the Ethics Committee of the\nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical\nUniversity, and all patients provided writ-\nten informed consent for publication of\ntheir information. The same surgeon per-\nformed all of the surgeries using the same\nfixation material such as plates and screws.\nAnother doctor in the same department\nwho did not participate in the surgeries per-\nformed the follow-up. The follow-up was\nconducted by a doctor\u00adpatient double-\nblind experiment.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nPCL injury was diagnosed by the following\ncriteria: (1) demonstration of PCL disconti-\nnuity on magnetic resonance imaging, (2) a\npositive posterior drawer test and tibia\nsinking test, (3) a >10-mm backward shift\narthrometer (MEDmetric Corp., San\nDiego, CA, USA), and (4) willingness to\nundergo arthroscopic minimally invasive\nsurgery.\nPatients were excluded from this study if\nthey had multiple ligament injuries caused\nby knee dislocation; no trauma history;\ncombined osteoarthritis, rheumatism, or\nrheumatoid arthritis; severe heart, brain,\nor kidney disease; or severe surgical incision\nsite infection.\nAmong the study group, 41 patients\nunderwent 4-strand autogenous semitendi-\nnosus reconstruction, and the remaining 17\npatients underwent deep hypothermia allo-\ngeneic tendon reconstruction.\nSurgical procedure\nIn all patients, a standard anteromedial or\nanterolateral operative approach was used\nto treat intra-articular hyperplasia, hyper-\ntrophy, and congestion of the synovial\nmembrane. During the surgery, the PCL\nwas confirmed to be fractured or nearly\nfractured (i.e., >70% of the PCL was\nruptured, the remaining fibers lacked elas-\nticity, and the intraoperative posterior\ndrawer test was positive). In patients with\na torn meniscus, the meniscus was sutured\nor partially dissected. In 23 patients who\nunderwent 4-strand autogenous semitendi-\nnosus reconstruction, an oblique incision\nabout 3 to 4 cm long was made 2 cm from\nthe medial border of the tibial tuberosity.\nThe fascia was then slit, and the attachment\nof the pes anserinus was separated. Using a\ntendon lifter for assistance, the semitendi-\nnosus tendon and gracilis tendon were\nremoved and neatly trimmed. The tendons\nwere sutured using nonabsorbable\nSomerville, NJ, USA) and woven into a 12-\ncm-long tendon graft with a diameter of\n8 to 9 mm. In the 11 patients who under-\nwent deep hypothermia allogeneic tendon\nreconstruction, the tendons were soaked in\nsaline containing vancomycin (1000 mg/L)\nat room temperature for 30 min and then\npretensioned at 80 N. The tendons were\nthen sutured and woven as described\nabove. When the diameter of the tendon\ngraft was <8 mm, the suture density was\nincreased to 8 mm in diameter. The remain-\ning attachment of the PCL, 5 mm away\nfrom the margin of the articular cartilage,\nwas taken as the positioning point. The\npatient's knee was bent to an angle of\nA hollow drill (diameter of 4.5 mm) was\nused to measure the length of the femoral\ntunnel. An appropriate hollow drill was\nthen selected to enlarge the tunnel accord-\ning to the length and diameter of the graft.\nThe devitalized tissue was removed, and\nonly the tibial attachment point of the\nPCL was retained. After selecting a point\ntibial plateau as the positioning point, the\ntibial tunnel was prepared using a tibial\nlocator according to the length and diame-\nter of the graft. Finally, using a traverse\ndevice for assistance, the graft was placed\ninto the femoral tunnel and tibial tunnel.\nThe tendon was then strengthened at a posi-\ntion of 60 using the anterior drawer test,\nand the tibia was fixed using an interface\nscrew (Smith & Nephew, London, UK).\nThe femoral tendon graft was fixed by a\nflip-button plate. The tibial tunnel tendon\ngraft stump was sutured with wire anchors\n(Smith & Nephew). After washing the joint\ncavity, the incisions were closed with pres-\nsure bandages.\nAfter surgery, each patient's knee was\nimmobilized with a chuck brace, and each\npatient was advised about the need for lim-\nited weight bearing during ambulation. A\ncold compress was used to cover the surgi-\ncal area, and the patients were encouraged\nto perform quadriceps isometric contrac-\ntion training. Two to 4 weeks after the sur-\ngery (and for the following 2 months), the\npatients were allowed to slowly bend their\nknee to a 90 angle. They were permitted to\ntry to bend their knee 120 only when the\nposterior drawer test was negative. Limited\nweight bearing on the affected limb was\npermitted, depending on the recovery of\nthe quadriceps. Competitive sports were\nprohibited for the first 6 months after the\nsurgery and for as long as the first 9 months\nin patients who had undergone allogeneic\ntendon reconstruction.\nData collection\nAll patients' Lysholm knee score, Tegner\nactivity score, and KT-2000 measurements\nwere assessed before the surgery; 3, 6, and\n12 months after the surgery; and at the final\nfollow-up. The Lysholm score consists of\neight questions assessing joint instability\nafter knee ligament reconstruction, and\nknee function is significantly affected. The\nreliability, effectiveness, and sensitivity of\nthis score have been internationally recog-\nnized. The Tegner activity score is often\nassociated with the Lysholm score and\ncorresponds to the patient's activity level,\nespecially the level of activity of a particular\nexercise type; the total possible score is\ncate the distance between the two tibias\nbefore and after a movement. These meas-\nurements represent a new auxiliary means\nfor the diagnosis of cruciate ligament\ninjury and efficacy evaluation.\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative data are shown as mean\n\u00c6 standard deviation. Differences among\nmore than two groups were assessed by\ntwo-way analysis of variance followed by\nthe post-hoc Student's t-test, and differen-\nces between two groups were assessed with\nStudent's t-test. A P value of <0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nPatient demographics\nThe clinical and functional outcomes are\nsummarized in Table 1. The follow-up\nThe final study group comprised 58 patients\nright knee and 19 had injured their left\nknee. Traffic accidents (n \u00bc 28) were the\nmost common cause of the injuries, fol-\nlowed by sports-related injuries (n \u00bc 18)\nand falling-related injuries (n \u00bc 12). Eleven\npatients had a combined meniscus injury,\nand four patients had a combined articular\ncartilage injury.

None of the above-mentioned\nparameters were significantly different\nbetween autologous and allogeneic recon-\nstruction at the final follow-up (Table 3).\nIn addition, no significant differences were\nobserved in the mean Lysholm score, mean\nTegner score, or mean forward and back-\nward displacement at the final follow-up\ncompared with at 1 year after the surgery\n(Table 2).\nDiscussion\nArthroscopic PCL reconstruction is one of\nthe most common surgical options for PCL\ninjury.8,9 Although this procedure has been\ncarried out extensively in recent years,\nincreasing evidence suggests that the long-\nterm prognosis may be unsatisfactory, with\nrecurrent laxity and knee instability being\nmuch more common in PCL than ACL\nreconstruction. This has been attributed to\nthe \"killer turn\" formed when preparing the\ntibial tunnel,10 in which the tendon graft\nforms an acute angle and scratches the\nsub-tibial cortical bone.11 The friction can\nlead to tendon graft injury and affect the\ncreeping substitution by bone marrow mes-\nenchymal cells and fibroblasts. No effective\nsolution to this problem has been identified\nto date. To reduce the friction, some\nresearchers have made a secondary incision\nbehind the articular cavity and anchored\nthe tendon graft to the intra-articular\ntibial tunnel opening with an interface\nscrew.12 However, this resulted in no obvi-\nous improvement compared with tradition-\nal PCL reconstruction. In the present study,\na PCL tibial locator was used to help create\nbelow the surface of the tibial plateau, and\nthe angle between the tunnel and tibial pla-\nwear of the tendon graft. The dual-fixation\nmethod was employed to further reduce\npostoperative displacement of the tendon\ngraft; i.e., an absorbable interference screw\nwas placed in the tunnel, and the tendon\ngraft stump was anchored to expose the\ntunnel outside. The postoperative follow-\nup examination confirmed that this\nmethod achieved a more satisfactory clini-\ncal outcome, including improved recovery\nof the motor function of the knee.\nTable 3. Comparison between autograft and\nallograft groups at final follow-up.\nLysholm\nscore\nTegner\nactivity\nscores\n(mm)\nIn healthy adults, the anatomical diame-\nmuch larger than that of the ACL.\nHowever, the diameter of the four strands\nof the hamstring tendon is only 7 to 9 mm,\nwhich is much smaller than that of the PCL.\nSome researchers have advocated deep\nhypothermia allograft reconstruction to\nmaintain the tension and strength of\ntendon grafts in the period shortly after\nPCL reconstruction.13 However, deep\nhypothermia allograft reconstruction leads\nto different degrees of graft rejection and\naffects the creeping substitution by bone\nmarrow mesenchymal cells and fibro-\nblasts.13 Other researchers have asserted\nthat tendon grafts with a diameter of\n<8 mm are not suitable for PCL recon-\nstruction because they aggravate the fric-\ntion caused by the \"killer turn.\"13\nTo prevent reconstruction failure caused\nby thin tendon grafts in the present study,\nwe wove the unabsorbed sutures with the\ntendon grafts to ensure that the diameter\nof the tendon grafts was >8 mm. Three of\nthe 17 patients who underwent deep hypo-\nthermia allograft reconstruction developed\nknee joint swelling, which was relieved by\ntreatment with a steroid; no other severe\ncomplications occurred. All three patients\nrecovered well. Furthermore, the knee func-\ntion scores of the patients who underwent\nallograft reconstruction showed little differ-\nence from those of patients who underwent\nautologous reconstruction. These findings\nwere likely due to the firm fixation of the\ngraft, increased angle of the \"killer turn,\"\nand relatively conservative rehabilitation\nexercises.\nThe recovery time after PCL reconstruc-\ntion is much longer than that after ACL\nreconstruction. The appropriateness of\nencouraging patients to perform knee flex-\nion function training as soon as possible\nafter surgery is controversial.14 We believe\nthat the performance of training exercises\nto strengthen quadriceps isometric\ncontraction in the early postoperative\nperiod could improve the ligament balance\nand muscle strength around the joint.\nHowever, to reduce the negative effects of\nearly postoperative graft tendon creeping\nsubstitution and the friction that occurs\nwhen the tendon grafts grow into the\ntibia, we were very conservative in limiting\nthe patients' early knee flexion: the patients\ncould bend their knee to 90 1 month after\nsurgery and continue to maintain this angle\nduring the next month. Two months after\nsurgery, after completing the outpatient\nreview and determining that no obvious\nlower limb muscle atrophy was present\nand that the muscle strength had been\nrestored well, the patients could try to\nbend their knee to 120. In this study, the\nmean forward and backward displacement\nof the tibia was satisfactory after healing of\nthe tendon allografts 1 year postoperative-\nly. Additionally, no patients showed signif-\nicant knee injury after surgery and were\nable to independently complete all of their\ndaily work after performing strengthening\nexercises for the patella and low-\nfrequency, low-intensity knee training.\nIn addition to knee flexion functional\ntraining, the following factors can affect\npatients' postoperative outcomes: graft\nsize, postoperative compliance with rehabil-\nitation exercise, postoperative adherence to\nmedical advice, patient's occupation,\nreduced bone mass, and reduced muscle\npower around the knee joint, especially\nthe quadriceps femoris.\nThe single-bundle reconstruction of the\ncruciate ligament using hamstring tendons\nor allogeneic tendons performed in the pre-\nsent study has been the main surgical\nmethod for nearly 20 years. According to\nthe literature, this method is also commonly\napplied worldwide.15 The patient's condi-\ntion is evaluated prior to the use of alloge-\nneic tendons, and all patients are required\nto provide written informed consent.\nAlthough serious complications such as\njoint infection and graft rejection are possi-\nble, no such complications were observed in\nthe present study. However, as noted in\nsome studies, the healing of tendon allog-\nrafts containing bone marrow is relatively\nslow.16 Thus, the postoperative rehabilita-\ntion program in such patients is somewhat\nconservative. In the present study, as shown\nby the long-term follow-up results, there\nwere no significant differences between\npatients treated with allogeneic versus\nautologous tendon allografts. A flip-\nbutton plate with absorbable screws was\nthe most common method used to fix the\ngraft. Many reports on the use of this\nmethod have been published in recent\nHowever, there were still some sources of\nselection bias in the present study because\nof the patients' social, economic, and\ncultural statuses. During the long-term\nfollow-up, patients with a poor or low\nsocioeconomic level showed poor adherence\nto the rehabilitation program and failed to\ngive feedback to doctors during the tele-\nphone and outpatient follow-ups. Patients\nwho did not complete the follow-up were\nexcluded from the final analysis. Some\npatients' lack of appreciation of the value\nof the postoperative rehabilitation affected\nthe positive feedback as well as frequency\nand quality of communication with the doc-\ntors, especially with respect to the patients'\nknee scores. Such selection bias cannot be\ncircumvented.\nposterior shifting of >5 mm still occurred\nin the present study. In some cases, the\nanterior-posterior shifting was >10 mm.\nIn one of the five patients with anterior-\nposterior shifting of 5 to 10 mm, the dis-\nplacement had expanded to 10 mm at the\nfinal follow-up. Furthermore, three patients\nwith original displacements of >10 mm\nshowed no improvement in the degree of\ndisplacement at the final follow-up. These\nresults illustrate that the measures we\nadopted played a limited role in preventing\nlong-term recurrent relaxation of the recon-\nstructed PCL. We have since performed an\nanimal experiment to investigate this\nproblem.\nIn conclusion, the results of the present\nstudy showed few complications and satis-\nfactory long-term outcomes for both autol-\nogous and allogeneic reconstruction. We\nhope that these findings can help to pro-\nmote postoperative recovery following\nPCL reconstruction and reduce recurrent\nrelaxation.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
