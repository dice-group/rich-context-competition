    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe main goal of this article is to analyze the relationship involving subjectivity, embodiment, and labor activity among travestis\nand transsexuals. We recognize that bodies are invested by various discourses and power relations, which produce normal\nand abnormal bodies in society, establishing the intelligibility of the body through gender categories. Beyond that, the body is\nan active element in the production of one's subjectivity. Transgender people are considered abnormal in the binary gender\nmatrix of intelligibility, which makes them more susceptible to be stigmatized, discriminated, and socially excluded. As for\nlabor, it has been observed that the bodies of travestis and transsexuals may represent an obstacle for the obtaining of formal\njobs.\n",

The intention is to analyze whether the visibility of their\ngender identity as transgender individuals manifested on their\nbodies may produce stigmas, discrimination, and exclusion\nfrom the mainstream social, organizational, and economic\nsettings, consequently affecting their choices and possibilities\nof labor activities. For this purpose, a qualitative study was\ncarried out with 30 Brazilian transsexuals and travestis, in an\nattempt to understand how such process occurs.\nThis research is relevant for the field of organizational\nstudies for three main reasons: First, we consider the dimen-\nsion of the study corpus that approaches travestis and trans-\nsexuals important within a social context that is apart from\nthe Anglo\u00adSaxon axis. Second, this article investigates the\nrelationship between the bodies of travestis and transsexuals\nand the work they perform, that is, it examines how the bod-\nies of travestis and transsexuals affect their labor practices,\nwhich is an issue that has been just sparsely studied (Thanem,\n2011). Last, but not least, studies on gay, lesbian, bisexual,\nand transgender (GLBT) labor remain underrepresented in\norganizational studies (Creed & Cooper, 2008).\nAbove all, it must be emphasized how difficult it was to\ncollect the data presented in this study. The research path\nbrought many difficulties. Actually, working with travestis\nand transsexuals requires different perception from research-\ners, as well as great sensitivity. This happens because nor-\nmality, or what is referred to as normal and accepted as such,\ncauses various groups to be excluded and perceived as abnor-\nmal or abject because of their bodies (Thanem, 2003). The\nproblem worsens when the topic of sexuality is brought up\nbecause, as Foucault (1988) tells us, much was said about\nsex in the 20th century, but little was allowed for exercising\nit. Coming from the private sphere, the topic of sexuality has\ninvaded the public sphere. Yet, it has remained as knowledge\nmostly pertaining to the medical and legal fields.\nFor this reason, the first part of this article debates the\nmajor theories in organizational studies that concern the\nhuman body, and then we attempt to understand the relation-\nship involving body, embodiment, and gender. Afterward,\nthe concepts of travesti and transsexual and some aspects of\nthe labor activity of such individuals are discussed. Following\nthat, the methodology is presented, and the data analysis is\nperformed, leading to some relevant conclusions.\n1Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil\n2Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil\nCorresponding Author:\nEloisio Moulin de Souza, Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Av.\nFernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil.\nEmail: eloisiomoulin@gmail.com\nWhen Invisibility Is Impossible: Body,\nSubjectivity, and Labor Among Travestis\nand Transsexuals\nEloisio Moulin de Souza1 and Alexandre de P\u00e1dua Carrieri2\n Keywords\nwork, travestis, transsexuals, body, subjectivity\n2 SAGE Open\nBody and Gender in Organizational\nStudies\nThe study of the human body is not a novelty in business\nadministration. Since the beginning of the systematization of\nbusiness studies, the body was a topic already present in the-\nories that perceived organizations as entities. Frederick\nTaylor, with his concepts of time and motion, and Henry\nFord with the assembly line, had already had human body as\nthe main subject of analysis, in their intention to improve\ncontrol as a means of increasing production. Parker (2000),\nfor example, has described Fordism as the systematic manip-\nulation of human muscles. Even along the premises of the\nHuman Relations approach, the concept was no different, for\nif one starts from the idea there is a division between body\nand mind, this idea will also elaborate forms of controlling\nbody production by controlling the minds of workers. This\nwas carried out by means of management of the informal\ngroups, which workers belonged to.\nThanem (2003) stresses the research on the body, and\nembodiment began to be intensified in the field of adminis-\ntration only from the 1990s on. Among such works, it is\nworth noting the works published by Acker (1990); Barry\nthis process. Thanem (2003) points out that most research\narticles that study the body emphasize its forms of organiza-\ntion, regulation, and normalization, whereas the studies that\napproach bodies as an element of resistance and disruption of\nsocially established standards are still peripheral.\nIn fact, many organizational researches have sought to\nunderstand the objectification of the body by organizations\nas a passive and inert object, characterized by power rela-\ntions. This analysis perspective is based on the classic\nCartesian division between mind and body, in which the\nbody is seen as a passive object, modeled and tagged by\nsocial forces. This approach does not perceive the body as an\nagent that resists against processes of objectification and\nstandardization, nor as an active element in the production of\nsubjectivities. In this respect, this article intends to disrupt\nwith this logic and to highlight the role of the body and the\nembodiment process as active components in the subjectivity\nDale and Burrell (2000) claim that bodies can be restruc-\ntured, and the self-image projected by the body can be recre-\nated. The body alone is no longer viewed as an organic\nsystem of interrelated parts, but instead, as an extension of\nthe self. As Brewis and Sinclair (2000) have shown, the rela-\ntionships individuals establish with their bodies are an\nimportant part of the way they perceive themselves and form\ntheir subjectivity. Works such as those by Bahnisch (2000),\n(2000) are incipient to consider the body as something active\nand to break with the Cartesian view of the body. In fact, the\nwork by Parker (2000) reaches the point of considering the\njoint action of the body with non-human actors during the\nprocess of subjective production.\nThe body is an important element in subjectification pro-\ncesses, especially in the construction of identities and subjec-\ntivities (Adelman & Ruggi, 2008). Of course the\nunderstanding by which a person recognizes herself or him-\nself as masculine or feminine is generally based on the\nembodiment process related to gender. It means that mascu-\nlinity and femininity operate as discursive labels involved in\npower relations that compel human beings to act and behave\nin specific ways, while offering ontological spaces for indi-\nviduals to occupy and delimiting the gender possibilities (the\nbody constitutes the self and is also restructured by it, con-\nversely). Indeed gender is neither ahistorical nor transcen-\ndental (Brewis, Hampton, & Linstead, 1997), and gender is\nneither something that someone has nor something that\nsomeone is (Phillips & Knowles, 2012). Gender is some-\nthing that someone does and undoes (Butler, 2004; Phillips\n& Knowles, 2012) and not a property of individuals (Linstead\n& Pullen, 2006). The process involving doing and undoing\ngender by the repetition of discursive norms is called perfor-\nmativity (Butler, 1993), and the logic present in these discur-\nsive norms produces intelligible genders (Butler, 1990).\nTherefore, intelligible genders are \"those which in some\nsense institute and maintain relations of coherence and con-\ntinuity among sex, gender, sexual practice, and desire\"\nthe intelligible genders is the control and prohibition of any\nforms of incoherent embodiment, searching to establish a\ndeterminist connection among one's biological sex and the\ncultural genders, hence constructing a sense of \"natural con-\nnection between genitals and gender identity\" (Schilt &\ndiscursively constructed and disciplined by power relations\n(Thanem, 2011). Bodies that do not follow or disrupt this\nintelligibility are considered abject (Adelman & Ruggi,\nintelligibility.\nHowever, despite the repeated citation of norms, perfor-\nmativity always escapes from its ideal identity because the\n\"ongoing performance of identity merely involves a\nrepeated citation of, or an `aiming for' an ideal state which\nIn other words, performance is the fantasy of a fantasy, and\nfor this reason, all performance demonstrates the contin-\ngency of gender identity and the potential of change and\nsubversion contained in such. The performance is not a\nmimetic reenactment. All repetition is unstable and opens\nthe possibility of subversion that creates gender trouble\n(Butler, 1990). In this sense, the binarism masculine versus\nfeminine \"cannot refract the fluidity that characterizes the\nembodied experience of gender\" (Linstead & Pullen, 2006,\nDe Souza and Carrieri 3\nGender is always multiple, heterogeneous, and a constant\nprocess of becoming (Linstead & Pullen, 2006). Beyond\nthat, the gender fluidity \"is not merely movement across a\nbinary boundary . . . or across several horizontal boundaries\nbetween multiples identities. Identity is motion and fluidity.\nIt dissolves boundaries and carries them off in its flood\"\n(2010) demonstrates that transgender individuals have the\ncapability to do (reinforcing attributes associated with femi-\nninity and masculinity), undo (disrupting the gender binary),\nand redo (resetting attributes associated with femininity and\nmasculinity) gender, simultaneously. In this regard, Thanem\n(2011) also asserts that travestis perform gender without\ndesiring to be permanently masculine or feminine, not only\ndisrupting the binary logic of gender but also undoing the\nvery gender (Thanem & Wallenberg, in press). Despite trans-\ngender people to be appointed relevant in the process of\nundoing and redoing gender (Connell, 2010), however, spe-\ncifically in the context of the formal workplace, due they to\nsearch to keep their job security and to maintain friendly\nrelationships, their possibilities to make gender trouble and\nundoing gender are limited (Schilt & Connell, 2007).\nTherefore, as mentioned before, the aim of this article is\nto analyze the embodiment process as well as how the body\nof travestis and transsexuals influences their stigmatization\nin labor activities. To do so, it seeks to understand the rela-\ntionships between embodiment and labor activity of the par-\nticipants studied. Hence, the next section presents the debate\non the definitions concerning travestis and transsexuals, as\nwell as the relations between their bodies and their labor.\nTravestis and Transsexuals: Body,\nGender, and Labor\nTo Namaste (2006), transsexuals are individuals born with a\nbiological sex (male or female) but who identify themselves\nas members of the opposite sex. To do so, they often take\nhormones and undergo surgery to reshape their genitalia.\nHowever, for this author, the term transgender means some-\nthing more comprehensive, which includes all forms of sexu-\nality that do not fit the normative relations of sex and gender,\nsuch as drag queens, drag kings, transsexuals, and travestis.\nBenedetti (2005) and Namaste consider that travestis and\ntranssexuals maintain direct relationships with the opposite\ngender of birth, and both authors define such individuals as\ntransgender. Nevertheless, the definitions about transsexuals\nand travestis are not that simple. As Hines (2006) asserts,\nthere are many distinct subjectivities under the transsexual\nand travesti labels.\nThe author affirms that such specific identities are singu-\nlarly situated and experienced by each individual, and \"many\ntransgender individuals articulate gender identities that fall\nbeyond a traditional binary framework\" (Hines, 2006, p. 63).\nIt means that the identity of transgender people is not only\nrestricted to circulate between a binary and opposite female\nand male poles. Opposing this assumption, Thanem and\nWallenberg (in press) affirm that travestis express in the\nsame time feminine and masculine forms of embodiment,\ntherefore undoing gender. However, although this is a chal-\nlenge, it does not dismantle the hegemonic forms of gender.\nFor this reason, travestis and transsexuals cannot be homo-\ngeneously conceptualized, and the particular experiences\nthey go through produce differences within each category.\nAs Perucchi, Brand\u00e3o, Berto, Rodrigues, and DaSilva (2014)\nstate, there is an intimate relation between transgender sub-\njectivity and the construction of their bodies.\nHence, the term transgender is used in this article as an\numbrella term to refer to people who do not follow the gender\nencompass travestis, transsexuals, cross-dressers, drag\nqueens and kings, genderqueers, intersexual, and agenderist\nindividuals, among others. In fact, the definition includes \"all\nindividuals who embody and express a gender identity which\ndiverges from the binary distinction . . . between female and\ning the binary logic of gender, the embodiment of transgender\nindividuals brings along social trouble and exclusion.\nAs for gender, it is important to understand that transsexu-\nals, unlike travestis, do not consider themselves as transgen-\nder individuals, because they do not see their bodies, identities,\nor lives as a part of a larger process of change that aims to\nbreak with the sex/gender binarism (Namaste, 2006).\nHowever, the bodies of travestis call such binarism into ques-\ntion, for these individuals remain between the borders of men\nand women bodies, for they simultaneously present charac-\nteristics that are socially considered belonging to women\n(e.g., breasts) and men (e.g., the penis). In contrast, transsexu-\nals wish to fit into only one of these binary categories.\nThe concept and understanding about what a transsexual\nindividual and a travesti are also change according to social\nand cultural contexts. Specifically, in a study on Brazilian\ntravestis, Kulick (1997) found that such individuals consider\nsexuality rather than gender as the main constitutive element\nof their identities. Thus, transvestisms are not only a matter\nof gender in the Brazilian context. Furthermore, both trans-\nsexual and travesti individuals in Brazil wish to undergo hor-\nmone replacement, but travestis tend to use most often the\ncorporal insertion of silicone, in order to change the form of\ntheir body (Perucchi et al., 2014). The main difference\nbetween travesti and transsexual individuals in Brazil is that\nalthough transsexuals undergo sex reassignment surgery,\ntravestis prefer to keep their penis and do not undergo a reas-\nsignment surgery. In addition to that, differently from\nSweden, where a travesti can be \"part-time travesti\" for\nsome hours during the day (Thanem & Wallenberg, in press),\nin Brazilian culture, for someone to be considered a travesti,\nit is necessary to act as a travesti full-time; otherwise, they\nare classified not as a travesti but as a cross-dresser or drag\nqueen, for instance. This happens because, as mentioned\nbefore, it is very usual among Brazilian travestis to undergo\n4 SAGE Open\nsilicone injection as well as clandestine procedures to have\nartificial breasts and a huge gluteus, which consequently\ntransform their bodies and make them visible travestis 24 hr\na day.\nIn the context of Brazil, due to the visibility of their body\nmodifications, travestis break with the idea of normality and\ncorrection in the correlation among sex, gender, and sexual-\nity, facing enormous difficulties and challenges in their daily\nlives (Tauches, 2006). In addition, their bodies are consid-\nered by what Thanem (2003) named \"contested and mon-\nstrous bodies.\" On this aspect, Namaste (2006) also stresses\nthat transsexuals are also subject to social discrimination in a\nvariety of ways. Unlike discrimination against sexuality, in\nwhich the individual can resort to strategies of hiding, it is\nnot possible to travestis to do so because of their corporal\nAs to the embodiment process as a set of regulatory prac-\ntices, the heterosexual matrix through which identities\nrelated to gender and sexuality become intelligible means\nthat some identities cannot exist. That is the case of identities\nthat break with or do not follow the determinist relation\ninvolving sex\u00adgender\u00adsexuality (Butler, 1990). For Butler\n(1990), such relation is political and instituted by cultural\nlaws. Therefore, they operate as a regulator of the meaning of\nsexuality. Nevertheless, many identities fail to follow such\nnorms of \"intelligibility,\" and they appear only as develop-\nmental failures or logical impossibilities form within that\ndomain. Their persistence and proliferation, however, pro-\nvide critical opportunities to expose the limits and regulatory\nHeteronormativity is supported by cultural, legal, and insti-\ntutional practices, which reinforce the logic that the sex of\nbirth determines the gender and the belief that only two pos-\nsible genders exist (masculine or feminine; Schilt &\nThese discursive norms force individuals to fit into a sin-\ngle genre but never into both. Therefore, gender and sexual-\nity operate at the personal, interpersonal, and institutional\nlevels (Tauches, 2006). At the personal level, society dictates\nwhat is considered normal for a person in terms of gender\nidentity and sexuality. At the interpersonal level, when two\npeople interact, appearance, behavior, gesture, body, and\nsocial norms act together to create attributions and categories\nfounded on gender and sexuality. Finally, at the institutional\nlevel, gender and sexuality are organized in a hierarchy in\nwhich men, masculinity, and heterosexuality are valued in\ncomparison with women, femininity, and homosexuality\nAn example of how heteronormativity acts at the per-\nsonal, interpersonal, and institutional levels operates in the\nworkplace and can be verified in Schilt and Westbrook's\n(2009) research. This work shows transgender individuals\ntrying to adjust themselves in the workplace according to\nheteronormativity. Female to male transgender individuals\nfollow men's behavior and conduct, searching to accomplish\ntasks considered appropriated to masculine abilities and to\nbecome \"one of the guys.\" However, despite the fact that all\nvariations of transgender individuals suffer discrimination at\nthe workplace (Connell, 2010), there are differences among\nthem. In the case of Female to Male (FTM) transgender,\nbecoming a man can bring prestigious and more opportuni-\nties at work. On the contrary, in the case of Male to Female\n(MTF), this choice often causes the loss of power positions\nin the workplace hierarchy (Connell, 2010; Schilt & Connell,\n2007). In other words, identities that do not follow the hege-\nmonic gender norms can perform gender in a negative way.\nThis means that identities that problematize gender become\nunlivable or less livable (Thanem & Wallenberg, in press).\nStigma can take different forms, such as race, sexual pref-\nerence, and religion, among others. However, individuals\nwith multifaceted gender identities as transgender acquire\nmore social visibility because of their body and embodiment\nprocess and become more subject to being socially stigma-\ntized (Creed & Cooper, 2008). When invisibility is not pos-\nsible and visible gender identities are socially stigmatized,\nsuch identities are marginalized in the workplace (Creed &\nScully, 2000). Transgender individuals are targets of hate\ncrimes, physical violence, and labor market discrimination\n(Thanem, 2011). The few transgender people who get a suc-\ncessful career in formal organizations conceal their gender\nidentity at the workplace, and due to transphobia present in\nmany societies, it is not easy for transgender individuals to\nbe hired, to be promoted, or to keep their positions at formal\norganizations. This fact compels transgender people to work\nin prostitution and other illegitimate forms of work to sur-\nvive (Thanem, 2011). To be a prostitute usually means to be\nphysically, socially, and morally dirty, but it also provides\nopportunity to perform gender differently, hence creating\nproblems with gender (Brewis & Linstead, 2000; Tyler,\n2012), and this perception of the prostitution constitutes its\nactivity as being a form of abject labor (Tyler, 2012).\nIn Brazil, transgender individuals are not treated as human\nbeings. They live and work in violent environments, and\nmany do not live up to the old age (Antunes & Mercadante,\n2013). Many transgender individuals in Brazil work in pros-\ntitution (Cortez, Boer, & Baltieri, 2011), and some common\ncharacteristics among transgender people who work in pros-\ntitution are poor education, low social-economic level, drugs\nand alcohol use, and unprotected sexual relations with a large\nnumber of sexual partners, which make them more suscepti-\nBesides, travesti sex workers suffer more discrimination,\neven when they do not work with prostitution, because of\nHowever, despite all this, one of the most common trans-\ngender complaints in Brazil is the inability to use their social\nname by which they identify themselves (Perucchi et al.,\n2014). Although being a MTF or a FTM transgender and not\nbeing able to change their names to a female/male name\nmake such individuals more susceptible to discrimination\nDe Souza and Carrieri 5\ndue to the visibility of their transgender condition. In Brazil,\nit is not easy to change one's birth name as it is in countries\nsuch as the United Kingdom. Changing the birth name is not\nallowed by Brazilian laws, and it can be done only when a\nperson goes through a very expensive judicial process that\ndoes not give any guarantee to be successful in the end of this\nprocess. Also, besides cost and uncertainty of success in this\nendeavor, the judicial process takes decades to be\nconcluded.\nMethod\nThis research was developed with the participation of partici-\npants who worked formally or informally in the four state\ncapitals of southeastern Brazil: Belo Horizonte, S\u00e3o Paulo,\nRio de Janeiro, and Vit\u00f3ria. The participants who compose\nthe group of interest for this research proposal are travestis\nand transsexuals. To describe the methodology of the\nresearch, the corresponding techniques used are presented\nbelow, followed by data analysis.\nThe proposed research was developed from a qualitative\nmethodology, for according to Denzin and Lincoln (2003),\nthis is a possibility for the construction of theoretical models\nof intelligibility, for the study of things that are not accessible\ndirectly, neither in their organization nor in their processes.\nOn account of the uniqueness and delicacy of the theme to be\nstudied, it was necessary to use qualitative research as meth-\nodology. The operationalization of the research field\ninvolved, at first, reaching associations that support homo-\nsexuals, especially lesbians, travestis, and transsexuals, in\neach of the four capitals of southeastern Brazil. An example\nwas the Centro de Luta pela Livre Orienta\u00e7\u00e3o Sexual\n(CELLOS)inMinasGerais(FightforFreeSexualOrientation\nCenter, in English). The research was conduct by two\nresearch groups: N\u00facleo de Estudos Organizacionais e\nSociedade (NEOS; Nucleus of Organizational and Society\nStudies, at Federal University of Minas Gerais) and Grupo\nde Estudo sobre Poder em Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es (GEPO; Study\nGroup on Power at Organizations, at Federal University of\nEsp\u00edrito Santo), totalizing six research fellows and two\nresearchers.\nTo limit the selection of research participants, the snow-\nball method (Gray, Williamson, & Karp, 2007) was used. In\nthis method, the selection is built throughout the research\nprocess, following further indications from the very research\nparticipants. Selecting the research participants intentionally is\nan important aspect of any qualitative research. This technique\nwas adopted because we consider that a technique aligned\nwith qualitative methodology should focus on singularity.\nTherefore, it would contradict the generalization of human\nexperiences. Moreover, the oral history of the individuals'\nlives falls into such precepts, valuing the unique and particular\nevents experienced by participants. The oral history favors the\nrestitution of circumstances, from the description of the very\nagent involved in these events, without aiming to cross the\nborders of particularity. Furthermore, the life history of indi-\nviduals allows researchers to reconstruct relationships con-\ncerning society, a given group, and the participants\nAt the field, researchers had to revise the methodology\nthat had been previously defined. Initially, all interviews\nwere supposed to be recorded and filmed. However, the vio-\nlence to which the participants who participated in this\nresearch are subjected forced a change in the methodological\nstrategies. Thus, interviews were recorded whenever possi-\nble, reaching a total of 24 travestis and 6 transsexuals.\nAmong the 24, 2 interviews with travestis were filmed.\nHowever, part of our data about travestis derives from non-\nrecorded interviews, annotated in field diaries. This added to\nthe total, reaching 30 MTF transgender people, mainly with\nthe participation of travestis. This was the most withdrawn\ngroup to take part in the research.\nBefore the interview, researchers explained to the trans-\ngender individuals the main goal of the research, presented\nthe term of ethical conduct, and asked them to record the\ninterview. As already said, some travestis authorized only to\nbe interviewed and observed at their work on the street as\nprostitutes, without recording their voices. All interviews\nwere conducted following a semi-structured script, recorded\nand transcribed or annotated in field diaries. This procedure\nwas developed carefully to preserve the faithful reproduction\nof the speeches and avoid cuts or additions. The interview\nquestions were developed with the participation of focus\ngroups with six travestis and six transsexuals, separately. In\nthe meetings, participants narrated their own life experi-\nences, mainly focused on the theme of labor (Rhodes &\nPullen, 2009). From the focus groups, the semi-structured\ninterview was outlined. After processing the data, the partici-\npants were named using female pseudonyms, to protect their\nidentities and the confidentiality of any evidence that could\nidentify them. In general, all participants worked either for-\nmally--in formal public jobs or as entrepreneurs--or infor-\nmally in prostitution and moonlighting. The data were\nanalyzed by referring back to the literature review presented\nin this article and comparing it with the empirical material\nproduced.\nSubjectivity and Embodiment of\nTravesti and Transsexual Individuals\nAs Benedetti (2005) has stated, both transsexuals and traves-\ntis experience social and subjective distress associated with\ntheir bodies. This feeling of suffering is manifested early in\nthe life of such individuals, which can be clearly evidenced\nin the speech by Natasha: \"At age 14, my family was already\nable to notice my effeminate ways, you know? At that time,\nhomosexuality was a disease, so my family sent me to a psy-\nchiatrist.\" The speech by Natasha highlights the suffering of\nnot being in accordance with the hegemonic and hierarchi-\ncally valued discursive possibilities of gender and sexuality\n6 SAGE Open\nbetween transvestism and transsexualism with sexuality in\nthe Brazilian society. Kulick (1997) has demonstrated this by\nfinding that Brazilian travestis consider sexuality rather than\ngender as the main constitutive element of their identities.\nTo sort out this contradiction and end psychological suf-\nfering, travestis and transsexuals try to adjust their bodies to\ntheir subjective condition, as much as their subjectivity to\ntheir bodies, for, \"It's not easy to be a transsexual. You look\nin the mirror and wish to be someone else. (You wish) to\nhave another identity. It's very difficult\" (Pamela), because\nwhen we find out we are travestis or transsexuals, we lose all our\nbonds. We lose our families, friends, we lose everything. You\nknow, the ones who manage to keep family bonds, in case their\nfamily accepts it, are completely different persons. (Mary)\nIt is impossible for such individuals not to seek the per-\nforming of their bodies, due to the fact that \"it is not an\noption, but a condition, you know what I mean? Being a trav-\nesti is not easy, you must fight against many things, you\nknow?\" (Kate).\nThe suffering regarding their bodies declared by Pamela,\nMary, and Kate highlights the connection between body and\nsubjectivity. For these individuals, their subjectivity can only\nbe realized through their bodies. Moreover, their bodies are\nactive in the process of subjectivity construction (Adelman\nbecause both transsexuals and travestis perceive as a form of\nviolence to look in the mirror and see someone else: \"One\nday you look at yourself in the mirror and think: `I can't go\non like this, I'm not that person who's standing in front of the\nmirror, that's not me'\" (Patty). Also, they can go on perceiv-\ning themselves as \"horrible\" (Catherine). However, there is a\ncrucial difference between travestis and transsexuals, as far\nas body-changing processes are concerned. Transsexuals aim\nto completely follow the social models that define the bodies\nof men and women according to the heterosexual matrix of\ngender, which include undergoing changes in their genitals,\nto become either a man or a woman. However, travestis do\nnot want their bodies to be completely as a woman's, as\nexplained by Margaret (a transsexual): \"I've always wanted\nto change sex. I never wanted to be halfway through. In that\ncase, I would be a travesti.\" Therefore, transsexuals aim to\nadjust their bodies according to the binary intelligibility of\ngender, that is, trying to transform their body into a \"real\"\nwoman body but not disrupting the hegemonic intelligibility\nof gender. On the other side, travestis are seen by transsexu-\nexactly because they are not willing to follow such\nintelligibility.\nWith regard to transsexualism, Sally states that\nYou fight a lot to run away from things, until one day you look\nat yourself in the mirror and think: \"I can't go on like this, I'm\nnot this person who's standing in front of the mirror, that's not\nme.\"\nTherefore, the body already manifests performances early\nin life, leading such individuals to a possibility of subjective\nexistence that is closer to a given body performance. This\nmakes them wish and seek to adjust themselves to the discur-\nsive possibilities of a woman or a man. Among transsexuals,\nduring the process of transformation (Linstead & Pullen,\n2006), the body is objectified and pointed out by respondents\nas something to be modeled and labeled in accordance with\nthe social constructions and power relations that define the\nbody of a woman. Transsexuals are completely tied to the\nbinary gender model (Butler, 1990), and they seek to trans-\nform their bodies according to one of two possible binary\ndefinitions of gender (a male or a female), as if those were\nthe only existing possibilities. They want their bodies to\nentirely follow such model, not challenging or questioning\nthe binary and excluding definition of gender. Indeed, as we\nhave seen, the bodies of travestis are seen as monstrous bod-\nies (Thanem, 2003), precisely because they stand at the bor-\nders between what is socially regarded as the body of a man\nor a woman. Travestis do not remove their original sexual\norgan, and thus, they jeopardize and put to test the binary\nmatrix of gender, which is so sacred to transsexuals (Namaste,\nFrom the interviews, it can be seen that in the process of\nbecoming, transsexuals consider the mind (subjectivity) to\nbe at the foreground, for they seek to find and complete their\nsubjective existence through the modification of their bodies.\nHowever, the boundaries between mind and body are not\nclear, because the respondents aim to restructure their bodies\nin accordance with their self-image, and the very self in\naccordance with the body image, conversely (Dale & Burrell,\n2000). Unlike transsexuals, who point out sex changing\noperation as the most important aspect to achieve subjectiv-\nity, travestis show that the maintenance of the male sexual\norgan denotes certain distinction. In this sense, the option of\nremoving the genitalia would establish norms to their bodies\nand would hence transform them into women. So would this\nbe the same as to fit into what society determines as to be the\nsexual duality underlying the concepts of a man or a woman.\nWith regard to this aspect, Patty emphasizes,\nI'm more into being different and valuing this, because if I get\noperated, I'll be normalizing myself, I'll be willing to be\n(normal). I'll be normalizing what is different about me, right?\nAnd all in all, there are millions of vaginas in the world, but just\na few people like me.\nAn aspect that must be highlighted is that the main occu-\npation of many travestis is prostitution, and the distinct fea-\nture of being a \"woman with a penis\" attracts more clients.\nFor Patty, the idea of being different is to not adapt her\nbody into the intelligible, heterosexual matrix of gender\nDe Souza and Carrieri 7\nis to become \"normal,\" through the normalization of the\nbody according to discursive norms. However, in the view of\ntranssexuals, when travestis break with the norms of gender\nintelligibility, they appear to be something incomplete, a fail-\nure, or maybe an ontological impossibility (Butler, 1990).\nFor travestis, such rupture is an opportunity to go beyond the\nlimits of regulatory intelligibility. The travesti bodies call\ninto question the binary gender logic, undoing gender (Butler,\nment retains at the same time characteristics perceived as\nbelonging to women (breasts and big gluteus) and to men\n(the penis; Namaste, 2006). For this reason, the binary intel-\nligibility of gender is not capable to reflect the entire com-\nplexity and fluidity of the embodied gender experience\n(Linstead & Pullen, 2006; Thanem & Wallenberg, in press).\nOnly the demonstration of the processes of embodiment\nthat operate on the bodies of transsexuals and travestis can\nreveal the relations between body and subjectivity, because\nthe body constitutes the self and is also restructured by it,\nconversely (Dale & Burrell, 2000). What we seek to high-\nlight in the processes of subjectification is the embodiment\nas an active element in the constitution of the respondents'\nthe self also becomes evident in the speech by Natasha: \"This\ndiscovery was everything but simple, because in fact we are\nalready born like a `trans,' we're already born with a little\ndifferent mind.\" In that sense, Natasha's body has manifested\nitself as something different from other participants' bodies,\nfrom a very early time. Thus, although as a child Natasha still\nwas not aware of other discursive possibilities that broke\nwith the hegemonic models of gender and sexuality, the body\nreveals and expresses this difference by acting directly as a\ncatalyst in the search of other possibilities of subjective exis-\ntence. This occurs in spite of these possibilities being discur-\nIndividuals have either to be a travesti or a transsexual.\nAccording to what has been previously mentioned by Kate,\nthis search \"is not an option but a condition.\"\nFurthermore, as already analyzed, such individuals attempt\nto adjust their bodies within the subjective possibilities of a\nsame time, as these also act by classifying and restraining the\nparticipant, they create in the same individuals a feeling of\ndissatisfaction regarding their own bodies. This happens\nbecause such bodies do not fit perfectly within any of these\npossibilities, making respondents seek the transformation of\ntheir bodies and subjectivities. Without such adjustments, the\nbody would carry on causing huge subjective suffering.\nBody and Labor\nThe Travestis stated that their families did not accept their\nbody and sexual condition, and they ended up kicked out\nfrom their households when they were still young. In the case\nof those coming from poor backgrounds with poor educa-\ntion, they were led to prostitution to survive (Cortez et al.,\nabout formal jobs, the respondents said it is virtually impos-\nsible for a travesti to be hired by a company as an employee.\nThey state, \"I've always looked for a job, I've always tried to\nfind work, with a social security card and all. It's a monu-\nmental task, you see?\" (Catherine), or that \"I didn't try other\noptions, and it's certainly very hard for transgender individu-\nals to get into the work market these days\" (Kate). The\nspeeches by Catherine and Kate also reaffirm the speeches\nby Adele, Agatha, and Alexis: \"That's when the question of\nwork market comes up, they do not give us opportunity and\nwe are discriminated right away. When you get there to hand\nin your CV, people won't even accept it, you know?\" (Adele);\n\"Gosh, it's a big challenge, way too big indeed\" (Agatha);\n\"There is no labor market for travestis, the doors are closed.\nAnd the alternative are the streets\" (Alexis).\nIt is a fact that Brazilian travestis often undergo corporal\ninsertion of silicone to accomplish the desired changes on\ntheir bodies (i.e., having big breasts and a big gluteus), but,\nat the same time, they also maintain certain male characteris-\ntics. This makes their condition of travestis completely visi-\nble to other people. Therefore, because they are a more\nmultifaceted cultural gender identity than transsexuals, trav-\nestis acquire more visibility, which consequently makes\nthem easy targets for social stigmatization (Creed & Cooper,\n2008). The main consequence of stigmatization is that it is\nalmost impossible for a travesti to be hired by organizations\nin the Brazilian labor market, due to the transphobia present\nin this country's society (Thanem, 2011). The speeches of the\ntravestis interviewed in this article have clearly shown the\ndiscrimination involved in the obtaining of formal employ-\nment, because of their bodies. Moreover, the fact that they\nhave been outcast home very early for their families, com-\nbined with discrimination faced by the performing of a body\nthat disrupts the boundaries of the binary model of gender,\nthe only option left for them is to work as prostitutes or set up\nsmall ventures. Beyond that, the majority of travestis came\nfrom poor backgrounds, and the lack of financial and emo-\ntional support from their families (Adelman & Ruggi, 2008;\nCortez et al., 2011) aligned to low education (Cortez et al.,\n2011) eventually led them into prostitution.\nThe entry into the formal work market is perceived by this\ngroup as evidence of social recognition, or a way to ensure a\npossible citizenship status for the interviewed participants.\nHowever, if the formal market closes its doors, of course, the\ninformal market (prostitution) still remains a possibility for\nsuch individuals. The speech by Alisson exemplifies and\nreveals one of the few alternatives available for this group to\nsurvive--prostitution.\nSo, it's like this, they don't even give us a chance, so the option\nthat remains is prostitution. There isn't any other, you either\nwork as a prostitute or you die of hunger, misery, and everything.\nSo I had to be a prostitute to survive, you know? (Alisson)\n8 SAGE Open\nHowever, this is not a new phenomenon, and work as\nprostitute is survivor strategy that has been used for many\ndecades, as Amber asserts,\nI started working as prostitute in the 70s. I was 11 the first time.\nI went through all these decades and faced the dictatorship,\nfaced the end of the dictatorship, faced AIDS, faced all that. I\nstill face prejudice today . . . .\nHowever, that is no easy task. Travestis who carry on\nworking activities as prostitutes must face violence, STDs\n(Sexually Transmitted Diseases), and social insecurity in\ntheir daily routines (Antunes & Mercadante, 2013; Cortez et\nwho lives the transgender life, exposed on a corner to make a\nliving, whatever happens to one them can happen to you as\nwell.\" Anna and Catherine agree with Natasha as they\nreiterate,\nWe already suffer so much discrimination from society, at night\nfor example, we take the risk of exposing ourselves, you get in\nthe car of someone you don't know, you don't even know if\nyou're coming back (Anna), because \"if you don't make money\nyou won't eat, you won't drink, you won't live and you also\nhave to draw your goals, we have to make a living. Out there we\ndon't know what we'll have to go through, what's going to\nhappen.\" (Catherine)\nFrom the speeches, it becomes evident that working as a\nprostitute is not their choice or first option, nor is it a typical\nor an easy job, first, because this is often the only option for\nsurvival for this group, and second, because it is not a for-\nmally recognized function by society. It exposes the partici-\npants to the risk of being shot or even being hit by a stone.\nThe violence involved in prostitution is part of the everyday\nlife of travestis. Moreover, Brazilian travestis who work in\nprostitution suffer violence more frequently than other sort\nof sex workers (Cortez et al., 2011) and are more susceptible\nto being infected by the HIV (Operario, Soma, & Underhill,\nHowever, poverty and low educational levels are not the\nonly causes that lead travestis to prostitution. As already\nmentioned, the corporal changes made in their bodies disrupt\nthe heterosexual matrix logic and makes them an abject\nbody. This affects their work and contributes to increase in\naggregated transphobia. Yet, working as a prostitute also pro-\nvides more opportunities to travestis to perform their gender\ndifferently from the norms of intelligibility (Brewis &\ndiscourse. Betty affirms that at \"15 or 16 I was hired with\nformal, legal and regular work contract . . ., but at that time I\nwas only gay.\" Betty complements that after the use of hor-\nmones to change her body, \"the only job I had as travesti was\nin the sex market. As a prostitute . . ..\" Then, as \"only gay,\"\nBetty managed to get a regular job, and it was exactly the\nbody changes to become a travesti that caused exclusion\nfrom the formal labor market. As Beverly asserts, \"the\ntravestis are very intelligent, they are very capable, you\nknow? They are not animals, they aren't monsters. We are\nlabeled as illiterate as a John Doe.\" Beyond that, the fact that\nmost of them work as prostitute increases the stigmatization\nof travestis, regarding them as physically, socially, and mor-\nally dirty in the Brazilian society (Tyler, 2012). This makes\ntheir labor activity abject as well (Tyler, 2012), due to their\nallegedly abject bodies.\nThe other possibility for travestis is to work as hairdress-\ners. Some respondents managed to set up small beauty par-\nlors to survive, because the formal work in companies is still\ninaccessible for travestis. Carmen affirms that \"[hairdress-\ning] is a field that accepts homosexuals and travestis easily\n. . ..\" The hairdresser shops work as a place of refuge for\ntravestis and also work as a support community among them.\nNevertheless, only the hairdresser shops owned or managed\nby another travestis or homosexuals hire travestis.\nHairdresser shops that do not fit in this characteristic usually\nfire them when managers/owners discover that the hair-\ndresser hired is not a \"real\" woman:\nYou get there and hand in your CV [with a female name]. You go\nthrough a test and are hired. . . . So people hired me thinking that\nI was a woman. When they asked to bring in my documentation\nto finish the hiring process . . . they would dismiss me, I was\nalways dismissed.\nThis speech highlights the importance of a long-standing\ndemand of transgender people in Brazil: the institutional use\nof their social name as a dispositive to avoid exclusion and\ndiscrimination not only at work but also in all social relations\nAnyway, the vast majority of travestis respondents are\nforced to work as prostitutes on the streets, without any\nsocial protection. The bodies of travestis do not allow their\ngender and sexuality to go unnoticed. Moreover, by putting\ninto question the boundaries of the binary model of gender,\ntravestis end up becoming the major targets of discrimina-\ntion during processes of recruitment by companies.\nTherefore, due to the fact that travestis break with the idea of\nnormality and direct correlation among sex, gender, and sex-\nuality (Butler, 1990), they come across tremendous difficul-\nties for being hired by companies as employees (Thanem,\nAs for transsexuals, the search for work seemed to yield\npossibilities other than prostitution. The speeches also show\ndifficulty in getting jobs, but there are also moments that\nseem to reveal a change in society. Carol discussed the dif-\nficulties faced by transsexuals in finding a job in the private\nsector: \"In the old days I used to send my CV with my birth\ncertificate name, and then when I got there, I was a com-\npletely different person. People were shocked; it was a sur-\nprise for them.\" Again, the importance of the social name for\ntransgender people is declared by the transsexual Eve\n(Perucchi et al., 2014). Eve makes clear that \"I was afraid to\ntransform myself during college and be expelled or become\nDe Souza and Carrieri 9\nunable to graduate.\" However, after graduating from college,\nEve succeeded in a public service examination and was\nemployed as a public servant. Afterward, she underwent\ndefinitive sex change operation.\nWhile trying to avoid or reduce discrimination at work,\nmany transsexuals seek to change their name of birth\n(Perucchi et al., 2014). Changing their names to names that\nfollow the heteronormativity involving sex\u00adgender\u00adsexual-\nity (Butler, 1990) allows them to conceal their transsexuality,\nhence making their transsexual condition invisible to society.\nSome public departments in Brazil already allow transsexu-\nals to use their \"social name\" expressing their gender identi-\nfication rather than their name of birth. On this matter,\nPamela declares that in the S\u00e3o Paulo City Hall, \"in health\nand educational departments, all transsexuals and cross-\ndressers must be called by their social name . . ..\" However,\nthere is no federal law that establishes this right to all public\ndepartments in Brazil territory, and its adoption or not\ndepends exclusively on the desire of the local governors.\nBecause of that, many transsexuals seek to change their birth\nnames by filing a suit in court. However, in addition to high\ncosts that limit the access of economically underprivileged\ntranssexuals, there is no guarantee that they will achieve suc-\ncess in this endeavor. As Carol asserts, \"The lawyer said\njudges are so conservative, and I'd be lucky if my trial\ndoesn't go to Supreme Court.\"\nMost of the transsexuals interviewed have received good\ntuition and do not come from such poor backgrounds. These\nconditions have allowed them to search for a public employ-\nment, to avoid the strong discrimination they would face in\nthe private sector. It is worth clarifying that in Brazil, public\nemployment is achieved through a selective process called\npublic recruitment examination. This test involves specific\nknowledge related to the position that the candidate shall\nhold, that is, a public servant position is not obtained through\na personal interview or an indication, but by means of a\nselective process in which a candidate competes against\nthousands of other applicants for a single vacancy. Once a\ncandidate is approved in a public examination, he or she is\nassigned to the position and can no longer be dismissed,\nunder the attributions of the law. Therefore, the selective pro-\ncess for the Brazilian public service is highly impersonal,\nand candidates are not physically known. This factor allows\nthe invisibility of the body and ensures economic stability for\nthe successful candidates. In public service examination,\nindividuals are just a number in a list, and in case they suc-\nceed, the Constitution assures that they occupy the position.\nOn this aspect, Felicia states, \"Working in the private sector\nis very bad, but in the public sector we still have a chance.\nYou know, in the public examination we're just numbers.\"\nMany transsexuals who participated in the interviews\nwork in the public educational system as teachers in primary\nschools. As mentioned before, this occurs because often\ntranssexuals have a better educational level compared with\ntravestis. For instance, Georgina declares to \"have accom-\nplished the complete curriculum to become a teacher. First I\ntook the basic courses to be a teacher, then I graduated in\nEnglish and Pedagogy and today I have a career in the public\neducation sector.\" Beyond that, the process of changing their\nbodies usually starts later in their lives as compared with\ntravestis, which allows them to conclude their professional\nformation not as transsexuals. They get into the process to\nchange their gender when they already have professional sta-\nbility in the public sector, as Alison affirms: \"There was a\nwhole context I . . . was 37 years old when I became Beatrice\n. . ..\" It can be concluded from the speeches that the trans-\nsexuals interviewed achieved some level of financial and\nprofessional stability when they began their corporal\nchanges. The fact they found economic stability prior to\nmaking corporal changes has made things much easier for\ntranssexuals. They constructed their career by not showing\nany disruption in the body and gender relation and by follow-\nas a way to avoid discrimination at work (Thanem, 2011;\nThanem & Wallenberg, in press). Just after they have accom-\nplished economic stability, they underwent corporal changes.\nBesides working as public servants and in the field of edu-\ncation, similarly to some travestis, many transsexuals have\nsought to set up their own business as dressmakers, mani-\ncures, or hairdressers. For instance, Hazel started working at\nage 12 as \"a manicure, a hairdresser, and a dressmaker.\nWomen stuff. After all this was my identity. When I had the\noperation, then I built up the courage and set up my own\nbeauty parlor.\" Holly sees herself as capable of doing various\ntasks: \"I never had a job. I mean, I was a hairdresser. I'm like\na jack-of-all-trades! I'm a hairdresser, I can sew, I cook very\nwell, I sell takeaway food, you know?\"\nNonetheless, this does not free transsexuals from discrim-\nination at the workplace (Thanem, 2011). Hope emphasizes\ndiscrimination suffered while working as a monitor for a pro-\nfessor in college: \"Many students found it strange, especially\nmen, you know. They thought, `wow, she's a travesti, she's\nmy monitor, I don't want to work with her\" (Hope). Jane\nstates that discrimination against transsexuals at work is fre-\nquent: \"When I worked in a company, jokes were frequent,\nthis and that, but I tried not to pay attention, ignore them, just\nleave it behind, because people didn't know what they were\ntalking about, they didn't know anything.\" Joanna states that\nthe other employees believe \"they can do harm because they\nare gays, travestis or transsexuals.\" As it can be observed,\nKelly states that discrimination occurs not only when people\nhave already been hired to work for companies but often dur-\ning the process of selection and recruitment:\nI was called to an internship at a soda company, but they did not\naccept me. They explained that since I was going to work only\nwith men and travel with them to various points of sales, this\nwould be an uncomfortable situation for them.\nEven transsexuals working in public jobs show evidence\nof discrimination at work. Some reported to face problems to\nbe promoted (Thanem, 2011), which is a manifestation of\nlack of professional recognition. Joanna makes clear that\nsexual recognition comes before the occupational, trans-\nforming non-promotions into a means for labor discrimina-\ntion. Also, according to Joanna,\nIf you look closely you will see that the public sector is full of\ntranssexuals. You know why? Because we're just a number and\nthere is an entrance exam. We're anonymous. And if we pass the\nexamination process, people must accept us. Of course, we still\nhave to suffer later on. In my case, I was never promoted.\nConclusion\nIt is concluded that not only gender and sexuality operate at\nthe personal, interpersonal, and institutional levels (Tauches,\n2006) but also the body operates at those three levels. At the\npersonal level, societies establish what is considered the\n\"normal\" body for a person, categorized into a particular\ngender and sexual practice, which, consequently, constructs\nand establishes processes of body objectification. At the\ninterpersonal level, the bodies of travestis and transsexuals\ninterfere in their relations with their families and other mem-\nbers of society. In fact, they can be marginalized by organi-\nzational managers as a result of their bodies, and such\nmarginalization is manifested in the difficulty to obtain a\nformal job, particularly in the case of travestis. Finally, at the\ninstitutional level, the body is organized in a consistent hier-\narchy in which the bodies that best fit the binary gender\nmodel are also the most valued.\nThe body is always in the middle of an intense interaction\nwith subjectivity, namely, the human mind. Subjectivity\nshapes bodies and is, at the same time, shaped by them.\nTherefore, there is no division between the mind and the\nbody. Besides, the body is not marked and passive, but\ninstead, it is active in the subjective constitution of travestis\nand transsexuals. The body influences the possibilities of\nsubjective existence in the scope of labor. Travestis face\nhuge difficulty to take formal positions in companies, for\nthey are discriminated because of their bodies, which, in\nturn, lead them to prostitution. Transsexuals also face this\ndifficulty, but because their bodies are more suited to the\nbinary model of gender, they manage to take up formal jobs\nin companies. In other words, it means that, because gender\nissues cause so much trouble to them than transsexuals, the\nlife of travestis becomes less livable (Thanem & Wallenberg,\nin press) than the life of transsexuals.\nIn this sense, to invert this scenario, it is necessary to\nimprove the use of social names by transgender individuals,\nto protect them from discrimination at the workplace and\nalso to provide them with a wider range of formal job oppor-\ntunities, especially in the private sector. Travestis do not\nwant to be sexual workers, but the policy of exclusion oper-\nated by companies leads them to prostitution. Prostitution is\nnot a choice; it becomes in many cases the only alternative\nfor survival. Added to that, travestis have skills and capabili-\nties to accomplish many tasks at the workplace.\nAs for transsexuals, in spite of having more job opportu-\nnities than travestis, they are also discriminated at the work-\nplace. Therefore, to avoid discrimination, affirmative action\nrights need to be extended to travestis and transsexuals, and\nthe use of social name needs to be warranted by a federal law\nthat regulates and establishes the use of such names in all\npublic and private companies. Moreover, the discrimination\nof transsexuals and travestis needs to be criminalized in the\nBrazilian law, into a humanitarian offense.\nAs a suggestion for future research, it would be interest-\ning to analyze the processes of subjectivity on and through\nthe body from the standpoint of female employees and orga-\nnizational managers in general. The understanding on how\nthese processes constitute realities and establish power rela-\ntions and forms of subjective existence has still received\nlittle research attention in the field of organizational\nstudies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The author(s)\nreceived financial support from CNPq (Conselho Nacional de\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico).\nReferences\nAcker, J.
