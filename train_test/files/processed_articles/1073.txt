This research provides a seasonal analysis using December and February to augment the previously\nanalyzed January data in representing winter, along with April, July, and October data to represent spring, summer, and\nautumn, respectively. A representative 500 hPa geopotential height contour was selected to delineate the NHCPV in each\nof the five months. The area, shape, and centroid of the monthly December, February, April, July, and October NHCPV\nare computed for 1959\u00ad2001 to supplement the previously identified January properties. These geometrical features of\nthe NHCPV reveal relationships between hemispheric-scale circulation and temperature anomalies throughout the year. A\ncircularity ratio (Rohli et al., 2005) is used to characterize the shape of the hemispheric-scale circulation. Results suggest\nthat only October exhibit long-term trends in either area or circularity, with July being the most variable month in area\nand October being the most variable month in circularity. Centroids tend to be skewed toward the Pacific basin, except in\nspring, but few systematic temporal shifts in centroid position were noted for any month. The NHCPV is correlated with\natmospheric teleconnection patterns in several months. For example, as was the case for January (Rohli et al., 2005), the\nArctic Oscillation (AO) is associated with the area of the December, February, and April NHCPV, while in December the\ncircularity is positively correlated to the AO Index. Also, the Pacific-North American index is correlated with the area of\nthe December and February NHCPV and with the shape of the December and October NHCPV.

One indi-\ncator of this prevailing circulation is the circumpolar\nvortex (CPV), a cyclonic circulation in the middle- to\nupper-troposphere circumnavigating the poles in each\nhemisphere. Because the CPV exists over the region of\nstrongest thermal gradients, variation in area, shape, and\nposition of the CPV characterizes the impacts of tem-\nperature changes on circulation. Furthermore, the CPV\nalso may explain variation in other circulation-dependent\natmospheric features, such as humidity, precipitation, and\npollution advection.\nRohli et al. (2005) suggested that in Januaries from\nexhibited no linear temporal trends in area or shape, and\nthat the mean centroid of the NHCPV is displaced from\nthe North Pole in the direction of the Pacific Ocean.

Because the win-\nter season is the time of strongest pressure gradients, and\ntherefore, the most meaningful and identifiable NHCPV,\nDecember and February analyzes were added to corrob-\norate the previous exploratory January results. Because\nof the labor-intensive nature of representing the NHCPV\nand calculating geometric features of it, April, July, and\nOctober were selected to represent the spring, summer,\nand autumn, respectively.\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this research is to provide a more com-\nplete history and better understanding of the NHCPV and\natmospheric circulation. The most fundamental question\naddressed in both this research and in Rohli et al. (2005)\nis whether the NHCPV exhibits long-term trends in geo-\nTherefore, this research includes several objectives to\ncharacterize the change in the NHCPV including:\nCopyright  2006 Royal Meteorological Society\n\u00b7 examining the long-term variability and changes in the\narea,\n\u00b7 characterizing the temporal variability and changes in\ncircularity,\n\u00b7 determining whether the mean geographic position has\nchanged over time, and\n\u00b7 identifying correlations between the area and circular-\nity of the hemispheric-scale flow (represented by the\nCPV) and sub-hemispheric-scale circulation features\n(represented by atmospheric teleconnections).\nFirst, it is important to document the change in area\nof the NHCPV. The size of the CPV serves as a proxy\nfor the overall degree of equatorward displacement of\npolar air and the polar front jet stream at its leading\nedge. However, even if the NHCPV shows similar\narea over time, it may force differing impacts. For\nexample, the NHCPV in two months may have the\nsame area, but in one of the months, the flow could\nbe characterized by intense ridges and troughs that give\nthe NHCPV an meridional shape, while the other month\ncould be characterized by a circular shape about the North\nPole (and therefore zonal, or westerly, upper-level flow\nthroughout the midlatitudes). Therefore it is important\nto examine changes in the circularity, or shape, of the\nNHCPV as well. This part of the analysis also addresses\nwhether any correlation exists between the area and\ncircularity.\nIt is hypothesized that the global warming signal\nin surface temperatures would be associated with a\nreduction in area in the NHCPV over time as the cold\npool of air over the poles shrinks. Furthermore, if the\narea decreases over the period, the NHCPV may become\nmore meridional (i.e. less circular) because zonal winds\nmay decrease when the temperature increases at the poles.\nHowever, because the January results failed to identify\nlinear decreases in area as hypothesized (Rohli et al.,\n2005), further analysis of other months is needed to\nsupplement the previous January analysis.\nA third component of the research analyzes whether\nany change in position of the NHCPV is evident over\ntime. It is expected that the mean position of the NHCPV\nwould be located near the North Pole. However, a\nshift from the pole to (say) a centroid over Siberia\nwould suggest that the cold pool has shifted equatorward\nover Asia and concurrent surface environmental changes\nwould likely occur.\nFurthermore, even if no changes in area, circularity,\nor position are observed in the NHCPV, the NHCPV\ncould still show two very different patterns and have\nvarying impacts because the shape may simply have\nrotated about the same centroid. Differentiation between\ntwo such patterns is performed through correlation of\nthe NHCPV properties to atmospheric teleconnection\nindices. The teleconnections represent pressure oscilla-\ntions around fixed points around the world. This part of\nthe study is important because any association between\nvariability in the area and/or circularity of the NHCPV\nand variability in teleconnection patterns would suggest\nthat the regional-scale teleconnections fluctuate as the\noverall, holistic pattern varies. By contrast, the absence\nof such a correlation would suggest that regional changes\ncould occur in the absence of (or independently of) varia-\ntion in the overall holistic pattern. It is hypothesized that\nthe teleconnections studied correlate with the geometric\nproperties of the NHCPV.\nData\nThe same data set from Rohli et al. (2005) is employed\nhere. Specifically, mean monthly 500 hPa geopotential\nthe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR,\n2003). This data set was selected so that results would\nbe comparable both to results from the January analysis\nand from previous work (Burnett, 1993). The daily\nobservational data are projected to a 5\u00b0 by 5\u00b0 grid\nincluding the entire Northern Hemisphere and are then\naveraged to produce the monthly mean. Limitations of the\ndata set are described in Rohli et al. (2005). The analysis\nof 5 months per year (February, April, July, October, and\nDecember) to augment the previously analyzed January\nclimatology provides for analysis in the annual cycle,\nwith more detail in the winter season when the NHCPV\nis most robust and influential on the hemispheric-scale\nclimatology.\nTo address the question of whether the geometrical\nattributes of the NHCPV are associated with atmospheric\nteleconnections, several standardized monthly indices\nwere examined. These indices were obtained from the\nClimate Prediction Center (CPC, 2003) and the National\nClimatic Data Center (NCDC, 2003). Specifically, data\nwere gathered for the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)\nand Ni~\nno 3.4 Index to represent the El Ni~\nno/Southern\nOscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, along with indices rep-\nresenting the AO, PNA pattern, North Atlantic Oscillation\n(NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (CPC,\nMethodology\nThe size of the data set permits statistical analysis of\nthe NHCPV properties by month (e.g. examination of\nlong-term changes in the January NHCPV, etc.). A\nspecific isohypse is selected to represent the NHCPV for\neach month, as recommended by Frauenfeld and Davis,\ndelineate the December and February NHCPV. Because\nthe same isohypse was used for January, it is possible\nthat the NHCPV may be over-represented in the core\nwinter month of January compared with the more `fringe'\nmonths of December and February. Nevertheless, we use\nthe months suggested by Frauenfeld and Davis (2003),\nwho studied geopotential height change by analyzing\nboth daily and monthly mean maps along a 5-degree\nmeridian to identify the isohypse that fell within the\nprimary baroclinic zone to best represent the NHCPV.\nTable I. Geopotential height contours (m) used\nto define the NHCPV. (Frauenfeld and Davis,\nThe area and circularity of the NHCPV were compared\nwithin a month (e.g. Januaries can be compared against\nJanuaries) using the predefined isohypse to represent the\nequatorward margin of the NHCPV.\nof the analysis, the corresponding height (Table I) was\ncontoured, the area and perimeter of the CPV in each\nmonth were calculated using the `XTools' algorithm\n(Delaune, 2000), and the centroid of each monthly\nNHCPV was calculated using the `center of mass'\ncriterion (Ciudad, 2002). An example of the analysis\nis shown in Figure 1. Regression analysis determined\nwhether the area of the NHCPV exhibits linear change\nover time for each of the 5 months analyzed.\nThe map projection is of great importance to this\nresearch, since results may vary depending on the projec-\ntion used (Rohli et al., 2005). More specifically, a map\nprojection that preserves shape but distorts area would\nportray the size of the CPV incorrectly. Likewise, if a pro-\njection that preserves area but distorts shape were used\nto identify the centroid of the CPV, the results would\nbe incorrect. Therefore, this research uses the Lambert's\nequal-area projection to address the research questions\nthat depend on equivalency (i.e. preservation of area) and\nthe conformal (i.e. shape-preserving) polar stereographic\nprojection when identifying the centroid (Robinson et al.,\nBoth projections were used to define the shape of\nthe CPV. The perimeter of a given CPV, projected\nin the stereographic projection, was recorded and used\nas the circumference of a reference circle. The radius\nwas then derived from that circumference and used to\ndetermine the area of that reference circle. Then, the area\nof a given CPV projected in the Lambert's equal-area\nprojection was divided by the area of the reference circle\nto determine the circularity ratio (Rc, Rohli et al., 2005).\nTherefore, Rc is directly proportional to the circularity\nFigure 1. 5460 m geopotential height contour for January 1960.

Furthermore, the circularity of the NHCPV also\ndecreases throughout the winter, with December being\n`most circular' on average, with a mean Rc of 0.706, and\nFebruary being `least circular' (mean Rc of 0.683).\nLike January, December and February's NHCPV areas\nwere distributed normally around the mean, with no\nsignificant skewness or kurtosis. However, the Decem-\nber Rc distribution was significantly negatively skewed\n(zskewness\nmost December NHCPVs were more circular than the\nmean Rc. This result is consistent with that found for\nthe January Rc as reported by Rohli et al. (2005). Unlike\nJanuary, which showed a leptokurtic distribution of Rc\n(Rohli et al., 2005), no kurtosis was identified for Rc in\nDecember or February. Therefore, the January NHCPV\nseems to be very consistent in circularity, while Decem-\nbers and Februaries are more likely to have anomalously\nlarge or small Rc.\nThe regression analysis did not identify any signifi-\ncant linear temporal trends in the December (p-value =\nAgain, these results support those reported previously for\nJanuary (Rohli et al., 2005). Similarly, trends in Rc for\nDecember (p-value = 0.091) and February (p-value =\n0.105) were not statistically significant, similar to the\nresults from Rohli et al. (2005), which suggest no trend\nin January circularity (p-value = 0.453). Therefore, no\nstatistically significant temporal changes in polar-tropical\nexchange in energy are apparent, but because of the\nimplications of this result for global circulation changes\nin winter, this phenomenon should be investigated fur-\nther. No significant correlation was identified between\narea and Rc for December or February, corroborating the\nprevious results for January. Thus, it appears that changes\nin the winter NHCPV area are independent of circularity.\nTo examine the position of the NHCPV, the cen-\ntroids for each December and (in a separate analy-\nsis) February were plotted. This analysis resulted in\nan almost identical pattern to that observed for Jan-\nuary (Rohli et al., 2005). Figure 3(a) shows that most\nDecember centroids fell in the western hemisphere, with\nand falling 532.7 km from the North Pole. Like-\nwise, the February centroids showed a mean position\nNorth Pole (Figure 3(b)). The position of the winter\nNHCPV seems to be displaced toward northwestern\nThe circular variance for each winter month was low,\nRose diagrams further depict this displacement, with\nan average of 77% of the points falling at longitudes\nbetween Alaska and Siberia in December (Figure 4(a))\nand January (Figure 4(b)). However, the February rose\ndiagram shows a slight increase in variance over the\nunexpected as February may display more characteristics\nof a transition month, with slightly higher interannual\nvariability.\nFurther examination for clusters in the overall point\npattern revealed significant NNIs for each of the winter\nin January (p-value < 0.001). Therefore, the overall\npoint pattern distribution for the NHCPV centroids was\nmore clustered than random in each winter month.\nHowever, significant (p-value < 0.05) clusters, or hot\nspots, were only found for the January and February\nNHCPV (Figure 5), if the minimum number of points\nrequired for a cluster is set to three.\nApril. April was chosen to represent spring and the\n5580 hPa isohypse was selected to represent the April\nNHCPV (Frauenfeld and Davis, 2003). The largest area\nwas found in 1978 (Figure 6(a)) and the smallest area\nwas in 1962 (Figure 6(b)). Likewise, the most circular\nmeridional April was 1983 (Figure 6(d)). Furthermore,\nthe April NHCPV area data were evenly distributed\nFigure 3. Centroids of the NHCPV for (a) December and (b) February.\nThe dot represents the directional mean centroid.

The April NHCPV, like the winter months, found\nonly short and weak temporal changes over the period.\nFinally, as for the winter months, no correlation between\nthe area and Rc was identified (r = -0.002, p-value =\nOn the other hand, results for the April NHCPV did\ndisplay very different results than those found in winter\nThe mean centroid was located over the Atlantic side\nfalling only 238.2 km from the North Pole, and the\ncircular variance was much greater at 0.69.

Not surprisingly,\nthe variability in the NHCPV movement precluded the\nidentification of clusters. Interestingly, April is the only\nmonth with most of the centroids located near the North\nPole. These results are not surprising because of the\ntransitional nature of the spring hemispheric circulation.\nJuly.

A\nsignificant positive relationship between the July NHCPV\narea and circularity (Pearson r = 0.323, p-value =\n0.039) was observed. Thus, a large (small) area of the\nJuly NHCPV is associated with a more (less) circular\nJuly NHCPV. This result suggests that Julies with anoma-\nlously small NHCPVs may at least partially offset their\ninability to advect cooler air southward by having more\nand/or larger troughs.

The centroids\nwere again displaced toward the Pacific with a mean\n466.5 km from the North Pole. The circular variance was\nrelatively small at 0.11. Furthermore, Figure 16 shows a\nhigh percentage (77%) of the centroids located between\nAlaska and Siberia.\nThe cluster analysis reveals a significant NNI of 0.609\n(p-value < 0.001), suggesting that the overall distribu-\ntion was significantly more clustered than random. Fur-\nthermore, two first-order clusters were found at the\n0.05 probability level, with the first cluster including\nfive points and the second cluster including four points\n(Figure 12). Both clusters were located in the same area\nas the clusters found in the winter months, leading to the\nconclusion that the autumn NHCPV acts similar to the\nwinter NHCPV.\nThe NHCPV and regional and hemispheric flow patterns\nTo investigate the NHCPV further, associations between\nthe NHCPV area and monthly atmospheric teleconnec-\ntion indices, and in separate analyses, between Rc and the\nsame atmospheric teleconnection indices, were examined\nusing Pearson correlation analysis. Any observed linkage\nbetween the NHCPV and regional-scale teleconnections\nwould suggest that the geographical position of the long-\nwave ridge\u00adtrough configuration of the NHCPV tends to\nbe `anchored' to certain locations. By contrast, an absence\nof linkage may imply that the NHCPV can `rotate' about\na constant centroid (i.e. alter the ridge/trough configu-\nration, as represented by teleconnection indices) without\nchanging its area or shape.\nThe Pearson correlation results between the area (and\nRc) and each of the monthly atmospheric teleconnection\nindices are shown in Table II. Five significant correla-\ntions occur in December, more than any other month\nanalyzed. First, the December NHCPV area was sig-\nnificantly positively correlated with the PNA pattern.\nTherefore, as the PNA teleconnection goes into a pos-\nitive phase, with an amplified ridge\u00adtrough pattern over\nNorth America (Leathers and Palecki, 1992), the overall\narea of the December NHCPV tends to increase.\nThe December NHCPV area also correlated signifi-\ncantly with the AO, and actually had the strongest cor-\nrelation of all variable pairs analyzed. Thus, the negative\n(positive) phase of the AO, with above- (below) normal\nsea level pressure (SLP) over the Arctic and anomalously\nlow (high) SLP in lower latitudes and cold (warm) con-\nditions particularly in northern Europe, is linked to an\nanomalously large (small) NHCPV. This result implies\nFigure 12.

Rose diagram for the October NHCPV.\nThe December NHCPV Rc correlated significantly\nwith two teleconnections. First, as was found for January\n(Rohli et al., 2005) a significant negative relationship\nwas found between Rc and the PNA pattern. This result\nsuggests that a decrease (increase) in circularity (i.e. an\nincrease (decrease) in ridge and trough amplification over\nNorth America) is coincident with increased (decreased)\nridging/troughing across the hemispheric Rossby wave-\ntrain hemisphere as a whole. However, it should be\nnoted that because the PNA-related ridging/troughing is\na subset of the entire hemispheric NHCPV, a correlation\nbetween these two variables should not be surprising.\nNevertheless, this result, when combined with results for\nother winter months (discussed in the following text),\nsuggests that the winter PNA pattern appears to represent\na subset of the hemispheric-scale circulation variability\nthat is not offset by coincident opposite amplification\ntendencies elsewhere.\nThe other significant December relationship is a posi-\ntive association between the Rc and the AO. Thus, when\nthe AO was in a `warm' (cold), or positive (negative),\nphase, the NHCPV was more (less) circular. It is interest-\ning that both the area and Rc are tied to the AO, with the\npositive (negative) phase of the AO linked to a smaller\nand less circular (larger and more circular) December\nNo other significant correlations were found between\nthe December NHCPV area and Rc. Interestingly, as was\nthe case in January (Rohli et al., 2005) neither the SOI\nnor Ni~\nno 3.4 correlated significantly with either the area\nor Rc of the NHCPV, suggesting that El Ni~\nno creates\nregional changes to the flow, but may not affect the\nNHCPV acting as a whole. Furthermore, no significant\ncorrelations between the latitude and longitude of the\ncentroid and either of the ENSO indices were identified,\nfor any of the months.\nThree teleconnections were found to correlate signifi-\ncantly with the area of the February NHCPV (Table II).\nFirst, the PNA pattern was found to be positively cor-\nrelated with the area. Thus, as the PNA teleconnec-\ntion moved into a positive (negative) phase, the area\nof the NHCPV increased (decreased). The correlation\nwas found for December. Furthermore, even though the\nFebruary pattern did not show a significant link between\nRc and the PNA pattern, the significant negative cor-\nrelations for the other two winter months between the\ncircularity and PNA teleconnection suggest that this tele-\nconnection may be an important winter `anchor' for both\nthe area and the circularity of the NHCPV.

Once again, the uniform response for the AO in\nall the three winter months suggests that this pattern was\na dominant feature associated with variability in NHCPV\narea. Finally, the area was also significantly negatively\ncorrelated with the NAO. While the area of the February\nNHCPV correlated significantly with three teleconnec-\ntions, the Rc did not correlate significantly with any of\nthe teleconnections studied.\nTwo significant correlations were identified in April\n(Table II).

According to Wallace and Gutzler (1981),\ntemperatures increase (decrease) around the North Pole\nwhen the AO is in a positive (negative) phase. Likewise,\na significant negative relationship was found between\nthe area and the closely related NAO. Once again, this\ntendency mimics the results found for most of the winter\nmonths.

July is the only month\nin which the Ni~\nno 3.4 or SOI seems to be an important\nfactor associated with NHCPV geometric properties.\nThis result is interesting because the effects of the\nENSO phenomenon have been regarded to be more\nmagnified in winter rather than summer (Newman et al.,\n2003). Perhaps the great distance between the pressure\nfluctuation and the NHCPV is associated with a greater\ntime lag in the effects of ENSO on the NHCPV than\nin the tropics and midlatitudes. July also had the fewest\nsignificant correlations of any month analyzed.\nTwo atmospheric teleconnections were found to be\nrelated to the October NHCPV (Table II). First, a sig-\nnificant negative relationship exists between Rc and the\nPNA pattern. As the PNA index becomes positive (neg-\native), the NHCPV becomes less (more) circular. This\nresult suggests that, as was the case for December and\nJanuary, the PNA-related ridge\u00adtrough configuration was\npropagated around the hemisphere rather than compen-\nsated by opposite anomalies of amplification upstream or\ndownstream. Perhaps the PNA pattern tends to become\nestablished as a part of the hemispheric Rossby wave-\ntrain in autumn and persists into the early part of the\nwinter.\nIn addition, October is the only month analyzed\nto show significant (negative) correlations between the\nNHCPV and the PDO. Specifically, the Rc became less\n(more) circular as the northern Pacific SSTs demon-\nstrate a positive (negative) `warm' (`cold') phase of the\nPDO (Newman et al., 2003). This result should be inter-\npreted with caution, however, because the period of the\nPDO is long \u00ad approximately 20 to 30 years (Newman\net al., 2003) \u00ad while the period studied only consisted of\n43 years. Therefore, the true nature of the PDO-induced\nvariability may not appear to a sufficient degree dur-\ning the study period. No other correlations were found\nbetween the teleconnections and either area or Rc.\nThe geometric properties of the monthly averaged\nNHCPV, including area, circularity, and centroid loca-\nperiod. Relationships between the area and circularity of\nthe NHCPV and several atmospheric circulation indices\nwere identified. For these analyses, the months of Decem-\nber and February were chosen to supplement the previ-\nously studied January to provide a clear picture of the\nNHCPV's wintertime properties. April, July, and October\nwere chosen to represent spring, summer, and autumn,\nrespectively.\nIt was hypothesized that the area of the NHCPV would\nthe concurrent general hemispheric warming trend. How-\never, no significant linear trends in area were found\nfor any of the months analyzed over the period stud-\nied. Only October showed a significant linear temporal\ntrend in NHCPV circularity (Rc), and that trend was\ntoward increasing circularity over time. If global warm-\ning decreases the latitudinal temperature gradient, then\ndecreased NHCPV circularity might be expected, but the\npresence of a linear trend in Rc only in October leaves\nlittle convincing evidence for a global warming signal in\nthe monthly 500 hPa NHCPV area and circularity. Inter-\nestingly, July was the only month to identify a correlation\nbetween the area and Rc.\nThe third research question stated that the NHCPV\nshould be centered on the North Pole. However, April and\nJuly were the only two months to support this hypothesis.\nFor most of the 215 months in the period (43 years,\n5 months per year), the NHCPV position showed a strong\ndisplacement toward the Pacific basin, north of Alaska\nand Siberia. This result supports that which was found\npreviously for January. Only April displayed a tendency\nfor centroid displacement toward the Atlantic basin.\nPerhaps the greater increase in sea ice accumulation\nover the Atlantic as compared to the Pacific in late\nwinter causes the baroclinic zone and NHCPV to shift\nequatorward over the Atlantic by April. By contrast, early\nin the winter, sea ice is already accumulated over the\nPacific sector. Most of the months showed a low circular\nvariability for the centroid location, suggesting that the\nIn winter, the intense cooling of the landmasses may\npossibly cause the zone of air mass contrast (and therefore\nalso the midlatitude westerlies, polar front jet stream, and\nthe NHCPV) to be displaced equatorward over this land-\ndominated region. The PNA teleconnection pattern could\nbe causing a shift in the NHCPV. Therefore, when the\nPNA teleconnection is in a positive or even in a `neutral'\nphase, the trough in the Alaska to Siberia region may\ncause the NHCPV centroid to migrate in that direction.\nThe NNI analysis suggested that the point pattern of\nNHCPV centroid is random in April and October, while\nthe centroid tends to exhibit a more preferred location in\nwinter and summer. Identifiable spatial clusters of at least\nin most of the monthly analyses, with no identifiable\nspatial clusters in December and April. The winter and\nautumn clusters were located north of Alaska and Siberia,\nwhile the summer cluster was north of Greenland. The\nresearch illustrated that the winter and autumn NHCPV\ncentroid seems to be positioned similarly, while the\nspring NHCPV position seems to differ from the other\nseasons, perhaps because of increases in accumulation of\nsea ice in late winter in the Atlantic sector.\nRelationships between teleconnections and NHCPV\nvariability throughout the year were also analyzed. It\nwas expected that correlations between the indices of\nthe teleconnections studied and the area and Rc of the\nNHCPV would be found. Results showed that the SO (as\nrepresented by the SOI) is the only teleconnection that\ndid not correlate with area or Rc in any of the months\nanalyzed. Another indicator of ENSO, the Ni~\nwas significantly (negatively) correlated only with the\nJuly area. By contrast, Pearson correlations identified\nseveral significant relationships between the NHCPV\nand the PNA pattern, including a positive correlation to\nNHCPV area in December and February, and a negative\ncorrelation with Rc in December and October (along\nwith the previously identified January). Likewise, the AO\nshows a strong relationship to the NHCPV in several\nmonths, including a negative correlation with the area\nin December, February, and April (along with January)\nand a positive correlation with the Rc in December. A\nclosely related teleconnection to the AO is the NAO, but\nthe NAO was negatively correlated with the area only\nin December, February, and April. Finally, the PDO was\nsignificantly negatively correlated with the October Rc.\nThus, this hypothesis was partially confirmed; some links\nto the well-known modes of low-frequency variability in\natmospheric flow were found.\nThe results of this research provide further questions\nthat should be investigated. For example, more months\ncould be analyzed to represent the spring, summer,\nand autumn seasons more comprehensively than in this\nstudy. Also, daily analysis of the geometric properties\nof the NHCPV would provide more insight into the\nnature of spatial and temporal variability at submonthly\ntimescales. Likewise, the addition of more vertical levels\nof analysis would provide further information about\nthe degree to which the NHCPV acts as a barotropic\nsystem. Finally, additional analysis should be conducted\nto investigate possible forcing mechanisms for the long-\nterm centroid migration of the NHCPV and associations\nto teleconnections.\nBecause broad-scale atmospheric circulation impacts\nenvironmental surface features such as temperature and\nprecipitation and a wide range of dependent environmen-\ntal conditions, it is important to understand the charac-\nteristics of the circulation (Davis and Benkovic, 1994).\nResults from this research provide clues to understanding\nthe puzzle of long-term atmospheric circulation variabil-\nity. After the characteristics and processes behind broad-\nscale atmospheric circulation are understood, the range\nof possible impacts on social systems, and communi-\nties' impact on climate from macro- to local-scale, can\nbegin to be understood. Eventually, such knowledge of\nthis `cascade of linkages' (Terjung, 1976) can contribute\nto the development of physical-human-process-response\nsystems \u00ad the highest level of scholarship in geographical\nAPPENDIX\nArea, circularity ratio, and coordinates of centroids for monthly\nYear Month Area\nRc\nCentroid\nlatitude (\u00b0N)\nCentroid\nlongitude\n(Continued)\nYear Month Area\nRc\nCentroid\nlatitude (\u00b0N)\nCentroid\nlongitude\n(continued overleaf )\n(Continued)\nYear Month Area\nRc\nCentroid\nlatitude (\u00b0N)\nCentroid\nlongitude\n(Continued)\nYear Month Area\nRc\nCentroid\nlatitude (\u00b0N)\nCentroid\nlongitude\n(Continued)\nYear Month Area\nRc\nCentroid\nlatitude (\u00b0N)\nCentroid\nlongitude\n"
