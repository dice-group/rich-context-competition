Retinopathy was defined as a level 14 on the\nEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity scale. We used joinpoint regression to\nidentify linear inflections of prevalence of retinopathy in the association between A1C and FPG.\nRESULTS -- The overall prevalence of retinopathy was 11%, which is appreciably lower than\nthe prevalence in people with diagnosed diabetes (36%).

A1C discriminates prevalence of retinopathy\nbetter than FPG.\nTests of glycemia and their thresholds\nfor diabetes diagnosis is an area of\nlong-standing debate. The presence\nof diabetic retinopathy is arguably the\nbest criterion from which to compare gly-\ncemic measures because it is a specific and\nearly clinical complication usually related\nto diabetes, and it represents a specific\nand relevant clinical end point for judging\nan alternative test (1). For these reasons,\ndiabetic retinopathy has served as the ba-\nsis for diagnostic criteria of type 2 diabe-\ntes (2\u00ad4) and provides the rationale for\nthe American Diabetes Association's rec-\nommendation of a threshold of a fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG) of 7.0 mmol/l to\ndefine the presence of diabetes (4,5).\nHowever, an analysis of three recent pop-\nulation-based cross-sectional studies sug-\ngested that there may be considerable\nvariation across populations and that the\nassociation of FPG with retinopathy prev-\nalence may be more of a continuous rela-\ntionship than previously thought (5).\nA1C levels are being considered as\nan alternative diagnostic tool for diabe-\ntes diagnosis (6). Unlike FPG, A1C does\nnot require an overnight fast, is not af-\nfected by short-term lifestyle changes,\nand has less variability within individu-\nals than FPG (7\u00ad9). Nevertheless, few\nstudies have examined the prevalence\nof retinopathy across the spectrum of\nA1C levels, which could assist in the\ndesignation of ideal A1C diagnostic cut\nThe newly released National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\nmultiple-field retinal photograph examina-\ntion, presenting an opportunity to reassess\nthe selection of glucose and A1C cut points\nfor diabetes diagnosis.

The NHANES protocol was ap-\nproved by a human subjects review\nboard, and informed consent was ob-\ntained from all participants.\nTwo 45\u00b0 nonmydriatic color digital\nimages of the retina were taken of each eye\nby a technologist using a Canon CR6-\n45NM ophthalmic digital imaging system\nand Canon EOS 10D digital camera. The\nfirst image was centered on the macula,\nand the second was centered on the optic\nnerve. Retinopathy lesions were graded at\nthe University of Wisconsin Ocular Epi-\ndemiology Reading Center according to\nthe modified Airlie House classification\nsystem, as used in the Early Treatment\nDiabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)\n(11).

FPG was measured in\nthe morning after an 8- to 24-h fast at a\ncentral laboratory using a hexokinase en-\nzymatic method (10).\nParticipants were asked if a doctor or\nhealth care professional had ever told\nthem they have diabetes (other than ges-\ntational diabetes). Those who responded\n\"yes\" were classified as having diagnosed\ndiabetes.\nHypertension was defined as use of\nantihypertensive medication or the mean\nof three or four readings of systolic blood\npressure 140 mmHg and/or diastolic\nblood pressure 90 mmHg. Time since\ndiagnosis of diabetes, diabetes treatment,\nage, sex, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, others) were\nself-reported.\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared three approaches to cate-\ngorizing A1C and FPG. First, we used de-\nciles, a widely used approach, to group\ndata. Second, we applied the cut points\nused in an analysis of the Pima Indians\n(2). Third, since both approaches may not\nyield a precise change point, we also used\na moving average smoothing technique.\nTaking a 0.1-unit increment each time\nfrom the lowest to the highest levels of A1C\nand FPG, we created a series of subsets\nwith a 0.5-unit range of A1C or FPG (win-\ndow) and then calculated the mean A1C\nand FPG and the prevalence of retinopa-\nthy for each subset.

It is also\ncalled piecewise regression, segmented\nregression, broken line regression, or\nmultiphase regression with the continu-\nity constraint (12). We used logistic re-\ngression, accounting for the complex\nsampling design, to obtain predicted\nprevalences and standard errors; we then\ntested the null hypothesis of no change\npoints of these prevalences by glucose cat-\negories using joinpoint regression soft-\nware developed by the Surveillance,\nEpidemiology, and End Results program\nof the National Cancer Institute (version\n3.3; Rockville, MD). We tested a constant\nprevalence of A1C or FPG level below the\njoinpoint and a linear association above.\nIn addition, to summarize and compare\nthe ability of A1C and FPG to identify ret-\ninopathy cases, we used Stata (version\n10.1; StataCorp, College Station, TX) and\napplied logistic regression, accounting for\nthe complex survey design, to calculate\nthe predicted probability of retinopathy\nfor each participant and the areas under\nreceiver operating characteristic curves\n(AUCs). Larger values of AUC indicate a\nbetter ability to discriminate. Because there\nis no postestimation command of AUC cal-\nculation specifically for complex sampling\nof survey data, the variation of AUC in this\nstudy might be underestimated.\nOur primary analyses included peo-\nple with and without diabetes.

Retinopathy\nprevalence began to rise precipitously\nwhen A1C exceeded 5.5% (correspond-\ning to the 5th decile) and after FPG ex-\nceeded 5.8 mmol/l (corresponding to the\n7th decile). This study also demonstrates\nthat the change points are helpful in find-\ning the lowest cut point for the diagnosis\nof retinopathy. However, to be used clin-\nically, at a minimum, further analyses to\ndetermine cut points for the diagnosis of\nretinopathy would need to include sensi-\ntivity and specificity analyses.\nOur A1C change point is similar to\nthat observed in a recent Japanese study\nserved in some previous studies, includ-\ning the Pima Indian study (6.2%), the\nEgyptian study (6.3%), and NHANES III\n(6.0%) (14). There are at least three rea-\nsons for this finding. First, in our study,\nretinopathy was assessed by two retinal\nphotographs in each eye, while previous\nstudies used either one retinal photo-\ngraph in one eye or direct ophthalmos-\ncopy to detect retinopathy. Thus, our use\nof a more sensitive assessment of retinop-\nathy (5) may have identified the presence\nof retinopathy at lower A1C levels. Sec-\nond, a higher proportion of the Egyptian\nand the Pima Indian populations were at\nhigh risk for or had diabetes (2,3); thus,\ncompared with the U.S. population, the\nwhole A1C distribution may be shifted to\nthe left. Third, discrepancies in cutoff\npoints may be due to differences in labo-\nratory methods for A1C measurement\nIn the Multi-Ethnic Study of Athero-\nsclerosis (MESA) population, there was a\ncontinuous relation between prevalent\nretinopathy (defined as ETDRS level\n20) and A1C and, based on change\npoint analysis, no clear evidence of a\nthreshold (5). Moreover, retinopathy in\nthe absence of diabetes (FPG 7 mmol/l)\nwas more frequent among individuals of\nminority racial groups than whites (16),\nsuggesting a higher likelihood of retinop-\nathy not due to hyperglycemia among mi-\nnority populations. This may have\ninfluenced the capacity of identifying a\nclear A1C threshold. In our study, minor-\nities represented 30% of the population,\nbut in MESA they represented 60% of the\npopulation.\nIn the overall population, retinopathy\nprevalence increased precipitously after\nFPG levels of 5.8 mmol/l, but the change\npoint was higher (7.0 mmol/l) among\nthose not receiving hypoglycemic treat-\nment. This suggests that treatment affects\nFPG level and shifts the FPG distribution\namong people with diabetes to the left.\nThe FPG change points observed in our\nstudy span the range of levels observed in\nprevious studies, including the Pima In-\ndian (6.8 mmol/l) and the Egyptian stud-\ncontrast with our findings, a recent anal-\nysis of three population-based studies\n(Blue Mountains Eye Study, Australian\nDiabetes Obesity and Lifestyle Study, and\nMESA) did not detect a clear FPG thresh-\nold for the prevalence of any or moderate\nretinopathy (5). Demographic differences\n(age, sex, and race/ethnicity), differences\nin status of hypoglycemic treatment, and\ncriteriaofdiagnosisofretinopathycouldex-\nplain these discrepancies.\nThere are several advantages to A1C\nas a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. A1C\nis less affected by short-term lifestyle\nchanges, and its measurement has been\nimproved and standardized during the\nlast decade. While hemoglobinopathies\nand race/ethnicity may reduce the validity\nlevel has less variability than FPG (7\u00ad9).\nNevertheless, the interindividual variabil-\nity of A1C is far more complicated than\nthat of FPG. Genetic factors account for a\nsignificant part of the variation in A1C\namong people without diabetes (19). Gly-\ncation rate is also influenced by factors\nother than the level of plasma glucose\n(20). In our study, A1C had a smaller CV\nand a larger AUC than FPG. Though FPG\nhad a similar level of AUC after adjusting\nfor other variables, these adjustments are\nnot practical in clinical practice. These re-\nsults suggested that in some circum-\nstances A1C may discriminate prevalent\nretinopathy better than FPG.\nOur findings provide additional sup-\nport for the current diagnostic threshold\nof FPG in diabetes while providing guid-\nance for potential diagnostic thresholds\nbased on A1C. However, we caution\nagainst the overreliance of these data\nfor several reasons. First, even though\nretinopathy is more specific than other\ndiabetes complications, the Diabetes\nPrevention Program recruited a popula-\nFigure 2--Receiver operating characteristic curves for A1C (%) and FPG (mmol/l) and prevalent\nretinopathy.\nAssociation of A1C and glucose on retinopathy\ntion at high risk for developing diabetes\nand found that 8% of people with FPG\nbelow diabetic levels had retinopathy\n(21). Similar findings have been reported\nby others (5). In our study, 8% of partic-\nipants with FPG 7.0 mmol/l had reti-\nnopathy. Longitudinal studies have\nreported that the presence of retinopathy\nin people with normal glucose levels at\nbaseline predicts the development of dia-\nbetes (22,23), suggesting that some fac-\ntors may play a role in the pathogenesis of\nboth microvascular changes and diabetes.\nThe presence of retinopathy among non-\ndiabetic individuals may also be related to\nother conditions such as hypertension. In\nour subset analysis among people without\ndiabetes, the prevalence of retinopathy\nwas 10% in those with hypertension and\n6% in those without hypertension (P \n0.222). The presence of these retinal le-\nsions in nondiabetic people is likely to\nattenuate the detection of the change\npoint of glucose level for retinopathy. Ex-\namining the prevalence of more advanced\nretinopathy by A1C levels may help in\nthe identification of diagnostic cut\npoints. However, because only 2 years of\nNHANES data are available, there is insuf-\nficient power to explore this issue further.\nSecond, our main analyses included\npeople with previous hypoglycemic treat-\nment. The inclusion of people on such\ntreatment could artificially reduce levels\nof glycemia in the population and lead to\nan overestimation of the steepness in the\nprevalence of retinopathy by glycemic\nlevel. Theoretically, a preferable study de-\nsign would follow people without diabe-\ntes treatment prospectively until the\ndevelopment of retinopathy; however,\nsuch a design is impractical due to the\nethical problem of following high-risk\npeople without starting hypoglycemic\ntreatment. In a sensitivity analysis, we ex-\ncluded participants taking diabetes-\nrelated medications. This had no effect on\nthe A1C change point but raised the\nchange point for FPG.\nThird, variability among different as-\nsay methods of A1C is a potential source\nof inaccuracy whenever A1C results are\ninterpreted relative to universal, fixed,\nclinical decision thresholds (15). The\nmean and range of percent A1C and per-\ncent of total glycated hemoglobin mea-\nsured by the ion-exchange method\n(which this study used) and the affinity\nmethod are similar. Nevertheless, Nuttall\n(24,25) argued that affinity chromatogra-\nphy has significant advantages over the\nion-exchange HPLC, especially among\npeople with diabetes, including less inter-\nference by hemoglobinopathies, more re-\nliability, and no need for validation by the\ncomplicated mass spectrometry method.\nIn summary, based on the latest na-\ntionally representative sample, our analy-\nsis examined the association of A1C with\nretinopathy and provides new informa-\ntion on defining cut points for diagnosing\ndiabetes. While the A1C and FPG levels of\n5.5% and 5.8 mmol/l provide start points\nat which retinopathy prevalence increases\nmost precipitously, A1C appears to dis-\ncriminate between the presence and ab-\nsence of retinopathy at least as well as FPG\nand offers some advantages over FPG.\n"
