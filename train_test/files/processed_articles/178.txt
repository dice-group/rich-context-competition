Approximately one-fourth of children\nand adolescents are obese (2), and 10% to 15% of boys and\n7% to 10% of girls are diagnosed with asthma during\nchildhood (3). The prevalence of obesity (2) and asthma\n(1,4) is increasing.\nRecently, we examined the relationship between asthma\nand obesity in a predominantly Hispanic inner-city pediatric\nsample of 171 children and adolescents and found that\nyouth with asthma had significantly greater body mass\nindex (BMI) values than youth without asthma, and that\n2.5 times as many children with asthma were obese com-\n*Departments of Pediatrics, Nursing, Physical Therapy, Exercise, and Nutritional Sci-\nences, and \u00a7Social and Preventive Medicine, State University of New York, Buffalo, New\nYork.\nAddress correspondence to Leonard H.

These results are\nconsistent with the relationships that have been observed\nbetween obesity and asthma for other groups of minority\nchildren (6,7), but it is important to confirm these clinical\nobservations on a more representative sample.\nIdentification of comorbidity between these two preva-\nlent pediatric disorders has important implications for the\nprevention and treatment of these problems. If asthma is a\nrisk factor for the development of obesity, it may be impor-\ntant for pediatricians to monitor BMI in youth with asthma\nand associated risk factors to prevent comorbidity of asthma\nand obesity. If obesity does develop in children with\nasthma, implementation of dietary and activity programs is\nneeded. However, there may be limitations in attempts to\nincrease physical activity in children with asthma. Children\nwith asthma frequently have exercise-induced broncho-\nspasm, which can decrease their participation in sports and\nvigorous free play (1,8), and the aversiveness of subjective\nsymptoms associated with exercise-induced bronchospasm\n(9) may make it more difficult to increase physical activity\nin an obese child with asthma.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the relation-\nship between asthma and obesity in a large pediatric sample.\nWe hypothesize that asthma, along with the traditional risk\nfactors for obesity of television watching (10) and maternal\nobesity (11), will be related to pediatric BMI. We also\nassess whether asthma interacts with other risk factors to\nincrease youth BMI.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nData and Sample\nThe Third National Health And Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) assesses a representative sample of\nthe population in the United States. Data were collected in\ntwo phases by the National Center for Health Statistics of\nthe Center for Disease Control and Prevention, between\nsample interviewed across all ages was 33,994. Our sample\nwas composed of the 5154 youths with obesity and asthma\navailable sample.\nMeasurements\nThe major dependent variable was pediatric BMI (BMI \nkg/m2, height measured with a stadiometer and weight, with\na balance beam scale). To control for age and gender\ninfluences, BMI values for children, mothers, and fathers\nwere converted to z-scores using gender- and age-appropri-\nate means and SDs reported in NHANES II (12). Obesity\nstatus was based on being equal to or greater than the 85th\npercentile BMI in the NHANES II reference data.\nRace and ethnicity codes were developed from the\nNHANES questions on race and ethnicity. Participants were\nclassified as white, African American, or Hispanic based on\nresponses to the race/ethnicity question. Additional subjects\nwere classified as Hispanics based on affirmative responses\nto Mexican American of unknown race on the race question\nand other Hispanic ethnicity on the ethnicity question.\nAsthma status (yes/no) was determined by the parent-com-\npleted item, \"Did a doctor ever say that (child's name) had\nasthma?\" Hours of watching television were estimated with\na question from the youth examination that asked, \"How\nmany hours of television did (child's name) watch yester-\nday?,\" ranging from 0 to 5 hours. Family income was\nestimated using the poverty income ratio, which is based on\nfamily income and family size. A ratio of 1 is at the poverty\nlevel.\nAnalytical Plan\nAnalyses and descriptives statistics used NHANES\nweighting variables that take the complex sampling design\ninto account to estimate population values. Analyses were\ncompleted with replicate weights for estimating variance\nand SEs for testing parameter coefficients, using the Wes-\nVar PC software package (Westat, Rockville, MD) (13).\nThe full sample weight variable was used, with Fay's\nmethod of balanced repeated replication, using a perturba-\ntion factor of 70% as the replication method. Multiple linear\nregression models were constructed to examine variables\nthat predicted youth BMI standardized for age and gender.\nCategorical predictor variables were dummy-coded before\nentry into the model. Interactions between asthma and gen-\nder, age, race/ethnicity, television watching, and maternal\nBMI were explored. In addition, logistic regression models\nwere used to predict youth obesity. Odds ratios (ORs) for\nobesity were determined controlling for gender, age, and\nrace/ethnicity.\nThe sample size for the relationship between obesity,\nasthma, and television watching was the entire cohort of\nchildren (N  5154) with obesity and asthma data. In\naddition to these relationships, we also were interested in\nexamining other variables that may relate to pediatric\nobesity, including parental BMI (11) and income (14).\nHowever, there was missing data for parental BMI and\nincome. A series of -square analyses was conducted to\nevaluate whether inclusion of maternal BMI, paternal\nBMI, or income was associated with significant differ-\nences in the proportion of subjects who were eliminated\nfor each racial/ethnic group. Inclusion of any of these\nvariables produced a significant reduction in Hispanic\nsubjects. When the sample was limited to non-Hispanic\nyouth, maternal BMI could be studied without a signifi-\ncant loss of subjects between white and African Ameri-\ncan samples. However, when paternal BMI or income\nwas included in addition to maternal BMI, missing data\ncaused a significant reduction in the percentage of Afri-\ncan American youth included in the sample. The second\nChildhood Obesity and Asthma, Epstein et al.\nset of analyses added maternal BMI as an additional\npredictor of pediatric BMI and obesity in the non-\nHispanic population.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the entire\nsample. Age was equally distributed across race/ethnic\ngroups. Slightly more than 25% (26.4%) of the sample was\nobese, and 11.6% had diagnoses of asthma.

The results from the\nregression model for this sample (Table 4) showed that\nmaternal standardized BMI was an additional significant\npredictor of pediatric BMI, with an OR of 2.2 (CI  2.18 to\n3.59) controlling for gender, age, and race/ethnicity.\nAsthma was not a significant independent predictor, but\nmaternal standardized BMI interacted with pediatric asthma\nto predict pediatric BMI.

Youth with\nbecome obese than youth without asthma, controlling for\ngender, age, and race/ethnicity.\nDiscussion\nThis study confirms clinical observations (5) that pediatric\nBMI is related to asthma during development, and provides the\nnew observation that pediatric BMI is related to the interaction\nof maternal BMI and pediatric asthma. Asthma may influence\nhigher BMI by increasing caloric intake or decreasing expen-\nditure. Asthma and maternal BMI were significant indepen-\ndent predictors of pediatric obesity, but maternal BMI did not\ninteract with youth asthma to predict pediatric obesity. Re-\nsearch suggests that caloric intake is similar in children with or\nwithout asthma, but children with asthma are less active than\nthose without asthma (15,16). Resting energy expenditure,\nwhich makes the largest contribution to total energy expendi-\nture, is greater, rather than suppressed, in children with asthma\nin comparison with children without asthma (16). Taken to-\ngether, these data support the hypothesis that increases in\nobesity in children with asthma are related to decreases in\nphysical activity. The relationship between obesity and\ntelevision watching observed in this and other studies (10)\nis consistent with inactivity being a major influence for the\ndevelopment of obesity in children. Asthma did not inter-\nact with television watching to influence obesity, perhaps\nbecause the influence of television watching on pediatric\nobesity is also very strong for children and adolescents\nwithout asthma.\nMaternal obesity is a traditional risk factor for pediatric\nobesity (17). Forty percent of children with obese mothers\nwere obese, compared with 19.3% of children whose moth-\ners were not obese, a doubling of the risk. Maternal BMI\nmay predispose the child to a higher body weight based on\na number of factors. Genetic influences (18) may predispose\nyouth to develop obesity by having a lower threshold for\npositive energy balance, such that children with maternal\nobesity have to consume fewer calories or be more active\nthan children with lean parents to maintain normal body\nweight (19). Gestational diabetes and metabolic dysregula-\ntion during prenatal development (20) may predispose chil-\ndren with obese mothers to develop obesity. Environmental\nfactors related to having a mother with high BMI, such as\nmodeling inactivity (21), development of food preferences\nfor high-calorie foods (22), and use of food as a reward (23),\nmay influence the development of obesity. Maternal BMI\nalso interacted with pediatric asthma to predict the contin-\nuous variable of pediatric BMI. The combination of a ge-\nnetic or environmental predisposition to develop obesity in\ncombination with increased sedentary behavior and lowered\nenergy expenditure in children with asthma could increase\nthe susceptibility of these children to higher BMI values.\nHowever, asthma and maternal BMI had significant and\nindependent effects when the dichotomous outcome, pedi-\natric obesity, was considered. Thus, there are differences in\npredictors based on whether the continuous variable of\npediatric BMI or the dichotomous variable of non-obese/\nobese is the dependent variable. Pediatric obesity is inde-\npendently related to asthma and maternal BMI, whereas\npediatric BMI is related to maternal BMI and the interaction\nof maternal BMI and asthma. These differences may be due\nto maternal BMI and asthma interacting in relationship to\npediatric BMI at lower levels than the 85th BMI percentile.\nLikewise, the failure to observe the interaction of maternal\nBMI and pediatric asthma may be due to reductions in\npower to detect the interaction effect when dichotomous\nrather than continuous variables are used as the dependent\nvariables.\nTable 2.

Future research is\nneeded to examine the joint influence of maternal BMI\nand asthma on weight in Hispanic youth. Methodological\nissues also limited the study of physical activity and\ncaloric intake as predictors of pediatric obesity. The only\nmeasurement of physical activity available was the single\nquestion that asked children, \"How many times in the last\nweek did you play or exercise enough to make you sweat\nor breathe hard?\" Because asthma may alter the threshold\nfor breathing hard, this definition may not be measuring\nsimilar degrees of physical activity for asthmatic and\nnon-asthmatic youth. The common method for collection\nof nutritional information for children and adolescents in\nNHANES III was a 24-hour dietary recall, with the recall\ncompleted by the parents for children younger than 12. It\nis well known that self-reported dietary information un-\nderestimates caloric intake in comparison with objective\nmeasures of energy balance (24,25). Consistent with\nthese data, previous analyses of the NHANES III data-\nbase showed no differences in the caloric intake of obese\nand non-obese children (26). Dietary data were not in-\ncluded to reduce the possibility of reporting a relation-\nship based on inaccurate self-reports.\nIf asthma is under proper control, children with asthma\nexperience few physical limitations (1). Children with\nasthma who experience respiratory symptoms during ex-\nercise have poor control of their asthma, and even mild\nasthma can be very restrictive if it is not properly con-\ntrolled with medications and environmental alterations.\nChildren with asthma and active lifestyles can have sim-\nilar exercise tolerance to control children without asthma.\nOnly the children with mild asthma and a sedentary\nlifestyle had poor physical fitness (27). Likewise, when\nchildren with and without asthma were matched on body\nTable 3.

For example, wheezing was related to\nincreases in BMI or triceps skinfolds in NHANES II (30). A\nsignificantly greater frequency and degree of bronchospasm\nof the smaller airways occur in obese children without\nasthma compared with their nonobese counterparts, which\nis related to the amount of subcutaneous fat (29). Changes\nin lung volume, as with obesity, can increase airway respon-\nsiveness in subjects without asthma, and chest wall loading\nassociated with obesity may mechanically alter airways,\nincreasing airway reactivity (31,32). Research suggests that\nadult BMI is prospectively related to onset of asthma (33).\nResearch on the causal relationship between obesity and\nasthma in youth is needed, including prospective research to\nevaluate whether the onset of obesity precedes asthma in\npediatric samples, and whether weight loss improves pul-\nmonary functioning in pediatric obese asthma patients.\nThere are several clinical implications to the current\nresults. Pediatricians should be aware of the relationship\nbetween asthma and obesity, and initiate preventive dietary\nand activity measures if the child or adolescent with asthma\nis in a family with an obese mother or if the child with\nasthma begins to show large increases in BMI for his/her\nage and gender. Children and adolescents with comorbid\nasthma and obesity should be provided treatments for their\nobesity, which include decreasing inactivity and increasing\nvigorous physical activity to decrease body fat and improve\nexercise tolerance. Comorbidity of these prevalent pediatric\nconditions suggests that attention to reducing sedentary\nbehaviors and increasing physical activity may be important\nin the prevention of obesity and treatment of asthma.\n"
