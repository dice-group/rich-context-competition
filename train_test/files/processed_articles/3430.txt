    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople vary in their preferred times of day for activity. Notably, as individuals age, their daily energy and attention\ntypically peaks earlier in the day. When voting is permitted may then affect voters' age distribution, even when holding\nconstant the number of hours polls are open. Data from along the time-zone border in Kentucky, where poll-availability\nhours vary, supports this hypothesis: places where voting hours are later see higher turnout rates among younger voters\nand lower turnout rates among older voters. The one-hour delay in voting hours reduces older registrants' turnout, and\nboosts younger registrants', by roughly three percentage points.\n",

Academics debate\nhow much such accessibility measures affect turnout (e.g.\nand judges grapple with the effects of extended hours for\npartisan or discriminatory aims. Such discussions have\nfocused more on the number of hours voting is available\nthan on the specific hours that are chosen. This is some-\nwhat surprising, as poll-opening hours vary substantially\nacross and within countries; changing voting hours may\nchange accessibility for different groups. Age, in particu-\nlar, is implicated. Older populations typically prefer rela-\ntively earlier schedules; the proportion of younger voters\nmay accordingly decrease when poll-opening hours are\nearlier in the day.\nThis hypothesis is tested below using data from along\nthe time-zone border that divides Kentucky. Eastern Time\nZone areas, where the polls open and close an hour earlier\nrelative to the sun, see significantly higher turnout among\nolder populations and lower turnout among younger pop-\nulations. This has implications for election results and for\nequality in ballot-box access as populations age across the\nrich world (Burden et al., 2017). More pointedly, though,\ngiven the divergent partisan and policy preferences of vot-\ners of different age groups, these results suggest that\nchoice of polling hours may influence substantive politi-\ncal outcomes in ways readily manipulated by electoral\nrule-makers (Dassonneville et al., 2017).\nAge and active hours\nBiology provides reason to expect earlier polling hours\nto affect the electorate's age distribution. One of chronobi-\nology's most consistent findings is that age correlates\npositively with \"morningness\"--i.e. being a morning\nperson--and negatively with \"eveningness\" (Adan et al.,\nolder people typically perform better on cognitive tasks\nearlier in the day, while younger people, if anything,\nreverse this pattern (Schmidt et al., 2007). This helps older\npeople to muster the energy for voting earlier in the solar\nday, so that having polls open more in the mornings and\nless in the evenings is more congenial for older than for\nyounger would-be voters.\nOlder people's greater tendency to be (semi-)retired from\nthe workforce further increases their flexibility to vote dur-\ning the day, putting less pressure on the post-work evening\nhours. In jurisdictions where election days are not holidays\nor during weekends, working (or preparing for the workday)\ntypically crowds younger voting-age populations' sched-\nules.

Potential turnout influences such as television\nschedules follow the clock, not the sun, and could also con-\nnect to age-related variations in turnout. For example, age\ncorrelates with more television-watching and less use of\ntime-shifting technology like digital video recorders (Mares\nand Woodard, 2006). Clock time's effects are, however,\nanalytically separable from those of solar time, even though\nin most contexts sun time and clock time are essentially\ninterchangeable. Continuing with the television example,\ntime-zone boundaries do not necessarily correspond to tel-\nevision market areas, so that broadcasts at a fixed clock\ntime may reach audiences at varying solar times.3\nPrevious studies have hinted that, within given polling\nhours, younger voters disproportionately show up rela-\ntively later in the day (Brown et al., 2006; Busch and\nLieske, 1985). Of course, patterns observed within a given\nperiod of hours need not extend outside that period, and\ncomparing turnout across different elections is complicated\nby the vast range of election-administration and candidate-\nor party-related factors that change voters' age distribution\nPomante and Schraufnagel, 2015). Any single election,\nconversely, typically shows little variation in poll-opening\nhours--but the exceptional cases where election hours vary\nfor different voters can provide empirical traction on the\nhypothesis linking votes earlier in the (solar) day to dispro-\nportionately older voting populations.\nKentucky's time-zone borderland\nOne such case can be found in the US state of Kentucky.\nDifferent parts of the state diverge in their poll-opening\ntimes. In particular, Kentucky polling hours extend from\neastern part of the state lies in the Eastern Time Zone and\nthe western part of the state is in the Central Time Zone,\nvoting in eastern parts of Kentucky begins and ends an\nhour earlier.\nThe region just on either side of Kentucky's time-zone\nboundary therefore allows observation of the effects of\nsolar time distinct from that of clock time, and serves as a\nrelatively clean quasi-experimental set-up for empirical\nMattingly, 2017). The time-zone boundary does not follow\nnatural barriers such as rivers or mountain ranges that might\nlead to stark differentiation between territories on either\nside of the border. Instead, it separates areas that are\ndemographically, culturally, and economically similar, with\nno statistically significant differences in observable charac-\nteristics such as population density or poverty rates (though\nsuch factors are further considered as potential confound-\ning factors below). Both sides of the border, importantly,\nalso vote for most of the same races in any given elections:\nnot only do all statewide votes span the time-zone border,\nso too do most of the region's state-legislative seats and, to\na somewhat lesser extent, those to the federal Congress.4\nFocusing on areas near the border minimizes contextual\ndifferences across larger geographical areas, then, and pro-\nvides generally similar background conditions and races at\nissue--while having voting hours that are, relative to the\nsun, 1 hour later in the western part of the state. Figure 1\nmaps the counties along the time-zone border in Kentucky.\nFor most5 election years since 1998, Kentucky pro-\nvides turnout rates among registered voters6 for each\ncounty in each of five age groups: those under 25 years of\nthose 62 and over. Even though casting a ballot is an indi-\nvidual-level choice and county-level (or, more precisely,\ncounty-age group-year-level) data is aggregated, using it\nraises few risks of ecological inference, as each individual\nregistrant in a county is matched with certainty to polls\nwith known opening hours. This demographic informa-\ntion about voters is released only for counties, not for\nunits with finer geographical grain such as precincts.\nThough there are advantages of considering narrower or\nwider bands on either side of a discontinuity (Arai and\ndata limitation means that the analysis here considers vot-\ners within roughly 40 km of the time-zone border.7\nThe quasi-experimental set-up reduces the need for con-\ntrol variables, though aggregating across elections does\nnecessitate controlling for races being contested. This is\nespecially true in Kentucky, where state-level offices--\nincluding the governorship--are elected in odd-numbered\nyears, separately from all the even-year, federal elections.\nFurthermore, different parts of Kentucky's time-zone bor-\nder region are in different congressional districts and so\nFigure 1. Kentucky counties along the time-zone border.\nLight gray counties are in the Eastern Time Zone; darker gray\ncounties are in the Central Time Zone.\nUrbatsch 3\nface differing elections for the House of Representatives.\nAccordingly, all models use congressional district-year\nfixed effects.\nResults\nTable 1 reports models estimating turnout as predicted by\nthe variables discussed above, including models treating\nthe categorical age-group variable as ordered, evenly\nspaced categories (in Columns I and III) and as a battery of\ndummy variables (in other columns). The dependent varia-\nble is percent of registrants in a given county-year-age\ngroup who vote. This variable is most often predicted using\nordinary least-squares linear regression, which for ease of\ninterpretation is retained in Table 1's Columns I and II.\nHowever, turnout percentage is constrained to being\nbetween 0% and 100%, and theory suggests nonlinear\neffects: if 95% of a population was going to vote anyway,\nan additional factor that encourages voting will probably\nhave a smaller effect than if only 50% would otherwise\nvote. This is accounted for by using generalized linear\nmodel with a binomial link function, analogous to a logistic\nregression model but predicting outcomes over the range of\npotential percentages. Columns III and IV report these gen-\neralized models.\nBeing in the Central Time Zone, with its later voting\nhours relative to solar noon, associates with higher turnout\nfor the baseline group (registered voters under the age of\n25). That effect of later voting, however, interacts with age;\nprogressively older groups see smaller turnout increases\nfrom being in the Central rather than Eastern Time Zone.\nIndeed, among the oldest age group, with potential voters\naged at least 62, turnout is higher in the Eastern Time Zone.\nThis interaction between age and time zone is consistent\nacross all six models, and meets standard thresholds for sta-\ntistical significance. It is also substantively appreciable,\nimplying that the effect of the later hour of voting differs by\napproximately six percentage points between the youngest\nand oldest groups.\nFigure 2 illustrates this graphically, using predictions\nfrom Table 1's Columns II (in the left panel) and IV (in\nthe right panel), leaving district-year as-is when calcu-\nlating the predicted value. For each age group, the pre-\ndicted turnout for a county on the Central Time Zone\nside of the border is denoted with a solid circle, while the\nhollow circles show predicted turnout on the Eastern\nTime Zone side of the border. As the figure shows, turn-\nout is essentially indistinguishable across the time-zone\nboundary for those between the ages of 35 and 61. For\nthe two youngest groups, though, Central Time Zone\ncounties saw turnout rates three to five percentage points\nhigher, while among the most senior voters, Eastern\nTime Zone counties' turnout was approximately three\npercentage points higher. While these differences are\ndwarfed by the underlying differences in turnout across\nTable 1. Ordinary least squares (Columns I and II) and generalized linear (Columns III and IV) models of turnout among registered\ndistrict-year fixed effects.\n\nCentral Time Zone \u00d7 Age group \u00ad1.44*\n\n4 Research and Politics \ndo appreciably shape electorate demographics. Indeed,\nthe implied effect size of this 1-hour shift in voting hours\nis roughly comparable to that seen when changing other\nconvenience-voting measures such as voter-identification\nrequirements or election-day registration (Hood and\nthese effects not on aggregate turnout but on specific\ndemographic groups, though, Table 1's results suggest\nlarger effects on election outcomes than would broader-\nbased shifts in turnout.\nMoreover, the relationship between time zone and\nturnout behaves as one might expect in other respects.\nConsider, for instance, how elections' importance might\nmodulate Table 1's effects. Polling hours that are uncon-\ngenial for members of an age group might especially be\nexpected to dissuade members of that group from casting\nballots in elections perceived to be low-stakes, even if\nthose group members think it worth the effort to turn out\nfor higher-stakes votes. This suggests that one might\nexpect time-zone effects on different age groups to be\nsmaller in higher-stakes elections: in low-stakes votes,\nonly people whose scheduling preferences coincide with\nlocal voting hours cast ballots, while in higher-stakes\nsituations, citizens of all ages cast ballots. Results in the\nAppendix show this to hold true; while older voters see\nrelatively higher turnout with earlier voting hours in all\nelections, the effects are larger in non-presidential years,\nwhen most Americans find voting and elections less\npressing. The Appendix also shows that, within age\ngroups, partisan orientation generally does not affect\npropensity to vote depending on time zone. Since there\nis little theoretical reason to expect Democrats to differ\nfrom Republicans in morningness, this serves as a pla-\ncebo test of the hypothesized mechanism.\nAre county characteristics\nresponsible?\nWhile proximity likely makes counties on either side of the\nborder similar, the quasi-experimental design might be\nquestioned. Any consistent southwest-to-northeast gradient\nin economic or cultural geography would correlate with the\ntime-zone treatment. This section explores whether con-\ntrolling for contextual characteristics affects the previous\nsection's results. Because few such variables are available\nat the level of the county-age group, these models' unit of\nanalysis is the county-year. The dependent variable accord-\ningly becomes the difference in turnout rates between the\noldest and youngest age groups; an alternative reported\nspecification uses differences between the youngest two\nand oldest two groups.\nSeveral factors potentially encourage the turnout of\nyounger rather than older registrants. Many of these are\ndemographic. Local preponderance of a particular age\ngroup may create greater collective-action difficulties in\nmobilizingthatgrouptovote(Morrison,2014).Conversely,\nlocally predominant populations may have the clout to\nmake it easier for their members to vote, as by getting poll-\ning places near a university or retirement community.\nCensus Bureau estimates of the percentage of a county-\nyear's population that is younger than 25, and the percent-\nage that is 65 or older, account for these possibilities.8\nFigure 2. Turnout (as percent of registered voters) by age in Kentucky counties along the time-zone border, as predicted by Table\n1. Solid circles indicate locations in Central Time Zone; hollow circles indicate Eastern Time Zone. Bars indicate 95% confidence\nintervals.\nUrbatsch 5\nThe Census Bureau further reports the ethnic distribu-\ntion of different ethnic and racial groups in each county, in\nparticular the shares of Blacks and Hispanics. Ethnic or\nracial features may affect propensity to mobilize (Holbrook\ntion between age distributions and ethnic mix--likely,\ngiven ongoing demographic shifts--might produce seem-\ningly age-related effects that instead reflect ethnic-group\neffects. Measures used to control for this are the percent-\nages of the population that are Black (alone or in conjunc-\ntion with other races, regardless of Hispanic status) and\nHispanic (of all races), respectively.\nEconomic factors may also affect different age groups'\nturnout. For example, consider population density. A\ndenser, more urban population distribution likely reduces\nmost voters' distance to their polling place. Such proximity\nto the polls varies in its effects on turnout to the extent vot-\ners of different age groups diverge in their degree of mobil-\nity (Haspel and Knotts, 2005). This is measured with\npopulation density, with a logarithmic transformation to\nreduce variable skew. Unemployment and local incomes\nalso correlate with both age and electoral participation rates\nis measured here using Census estimates of median house-\nTable 2 brings these variables together in ordinary least-\nsquares models with panel-corrected standard errors and, as\nwith Table 1, congressional district-year fixed effects. The\ntable's first column predicts differences in turnout between\nthe oldest and youngest registrant categories, while the\nsecond column aggregates the youngest two and oldest two\ncategories.\nIn both models, being in the Central Time Zone again\nassociates with a smaller gap in turnout between younger and\nolder registrants. Being on the western side of the time-zone\nborder appears to reduce the turnout gap across age groups by\none-and-a-half to two percentage points. The effect continues\nto attain standard benchmarks of statistical significance, and\nis roughly comparable in magnitude to the predicted effect of\nincreasing population density by one standard deviation.\nConclusion\nMaking poll-opening hours earlier or later may change the\nage distribution of voters: when polls are open earlier in the\nsolar day, turnout increases among older but decreases\namong younger voters. This is true despite the difference in\nvoting hours here, shifted by a mere hour on either side of a\ntime-zone boundary, being relatively small in the universe\nof plausible voting hours; the logic of how different groups\nreact to time extends to later plausible voting hours as well.\nThat is, although the case examined here cannot directly\ntest the claim, presumably the difference between opening\nAM would be somewhat larger than that examined here.\nThose concerned about ensuring equal ballot access, or\nabout predicting (or altering) electoral turnout, may accord-\ningly find it fruitful to consider not just how many hours\nvoting is allowed in, or on what day those hours are, but\nalso to what time of day the hours involve. Such concerns\nmay extend beyond young or old voters. Income may relate\nto casting a ballot earlier in the day, perhaps because higher-\nincome jobs offer more flexible work schedules (Fuchs and\nBecker, 1968). Poorer or richer voters may then comprise a\nlarger share of voters depending on the hours that polls are\nopen, with potential implications for representation, elec-\ntoral outcomes, and exit-poll interpretation. Future research\ncan explore such other demographic dimensions.\nIt may also examine the effects of poll-availability times\nin other places and contexts. Kentucky is somewhat unusual\nin the earliness of its voting hours: 6 AM to 6 PM leaves\nrelatively little time for those with a typical working day to\nvote on their way home. The age-and-turnout effects of\nshifting polling times may vary in size for places that have\nlater, or shorter, voting hours. Other features of electoral\nadministration may matter as well. Varying access to postal\nballoting, for example, may shape how dependent would-be\nvoters are on election-day polling hours. So, too, might the\nseason of the election and the polling location's latitude and\nlongitude; these features affect solar-time benchmarks.\nThe results here fit in with recent scholarly recognition\nthat time is not fungible in its voting impact. Context can\nmake the minutes needed to vote seem more or less costly\noften central to the cost side of political participation's\nTable 2. Ordinary least squares models of turnout gap\nbetween older and younger age groups in Kentucky counties,\nmodels include district-year fixed effects.\n6 Research and Politics \ncost-benefit decision calculus, taking such temporal factors\nseriously is likely to improve understanding of many impor-\ntant political behaviors. The findings also emphasize the\ndegree to which the decision to vote may be contingent on\ncircumstances on election day itself. The effects observed\nhere suggest that the decision to vote for marginal voters (as\nopposed to habitual ones) depends on mood, attention, and\nenergy at the time when voting is possible rather than long-\nterm planning. This may contribute to the difficulties of\nforecasting who will vote (Rogers and Aida, 2014). Better\nunderstanding how circumstances like time and context\naffect propensity to vote can help allay these difficulties.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interest\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nSupplementary Material\nThe supplementary files are available at http://journals.sagepub.\nfiles are available at: http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/research\nandpolitics.\nNotes\n1.
