One of the dimensions often\nresearched, mostly via surveys, is that of the auditor's roles and responsibilities according to both\nauditors and the public (e.g., see Humphrey, Moizer & Turley, 1993; Koh & Woo, 1998).Aless examined\ndimension is the materiality gap, that is, the gap in perceptions of materiality for financial statements as\na whole between auditors, preparers and users. Studying this gap is important for two reasons: First,\nwhen looking at the audit opinion, it is quite clear that studying the materiality gap is an important\nresearch issue. An audit opinion states, among other things, that the financial statements are free from\nmaterial mistakes. This raises the question whether preparers, auditors and users have the same view\nabout what `free from material mistakes' means, or whether there is, in fact, a so-called materiality gap\n(as part of the audit expectation gap). Second, the materiality for the financial statements as a whole\nforms the basis for the audit work to be carried out. So materiality plays an important role in the auditing\nprocess. However, there is no generally accepted definition of materiality. The International Standards\non Auditing (ISA)1 notes in Section 320.2 that different financial reporting frameworks tend to discuss\nmateriality in very similar terms:\n\u00b7 `Misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be material if they, individually or in the\naggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the\nbasis of the financial statements;\n\u00b7 Judgments about materiality are made in the light of surrounding circumstances, and are affected\nby the size or the nature of a misstatement, or a combination of both; and\n\u00b7 Judgments about matters that are material to users of the financial statements are based on a\nconsideration of the common financial information needs of users as a group. The possible effect\nof misstatements on specific individual users, whose needs may vary widely, is not considered.'\nInternational Standards on Auditing states that both the amount (quantity) and the nature (quality) of the\nmisstatements need to be considered. International Standards on Auditing also states that the auditor\nshould determine materiality for the financial statements as a whole (ISA 320.10) and that (s)he should\nalso document the materiality level, if applicable, for particular classes of transactions, account balances\nWhile the materiality gap is an important research issue, the number of previous studies on this topic\nis quite small, and the research is limited in several respects. Important limitations include a tendency to\nrely on experimental methods as opposed to real-life situations and a general emphasis on the perceptions\nof users as opposed to preparers. Moreover, the object of previous studies was the materiality of individual\nitems, and not the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. This article reports on an exploratory\nstudy of matched auditor and preparer perceptions of materiality in actual financial statements. The main\nfinding is that preparers think of materiality in terms of lower thresholds compared to their auditor\ncounterparts.Thisresultisinconsistentwiththegeneralfindingsreportedinliterature,andrecommendations\nare therefore made to pursue this line of research.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the second section contains a brief review of\nliterature on the materiality gap. In the third section, the research approach used in this paper, as well as\nthe main findings, is described. The fourth section provides conclusions, limitations and suggestions for\nfurther research.\nReview of Literature\nThe audit expectation gap (sometimes referred to as audit expectation\u00adperformance gap) is, generally\nspeaking, well-researched in literature (see Best, Buckby & Tan, 2001). The gap is defined as the difference\nbetween society's expectations of auditors and perceived performance of auditors (Porter, 1993).\nHowever, the concept of audit materiality as an element of the audit expectation gap is little noted in\nliterature (Houghton & Jubb, 2011). In their research, Houghton and Jubb (2010) describe two ways in\nwhich the term materiality is used in the context of auditing. The first relates to `bigness' and relates to\nthe materiality of individual items in the financial statements. The second relates to the concept of\nmateriality for the financial statement as a whole, which is the basis for (i) determining the nature, timing\nand extent of risk assessment procedures; (ii) identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatements;\nand (iii) determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures (ISA 320.6) (Houghton &\nMessier, Martinov-Bennie and Eilifsen (2005) and Holstrum and Messier (1982) documented prior\nresearch on materiality (judgements), including comparative studies in which materiality and disclosure\njudgements between auditors, preparers and users, are studied. Based on their literature reviews and\nadditional research, it can be concluded that while there have been many studies on materiality judgements\nof auditors and users separately, the number of studies published specifically on materiality as part of the\naudit expectation gap is limited. In this section, four published articles on this gap will be discussed.\nAll studies deal with `bigness' and relate to the question of whether a certain item, considered by itself,\nis material or not. As far as can be ascertained, no research has been published on the aggregated\nmateriality level as part of the audit expectation gap, defined in the introduction as the materiality gap.\nbased on experiments, and one study (Jennings, Reckers & Kneer, 1991) is based on a survey. All studies\nexamined the gap between auditors and users; additionally, the study done by Firth (1979) looked at the\ngap between preparers and auditors as well as at the gap between preparers and users. All papers\nexamined the gap in respect to materiality attributed to disclosure items; in addition, Jennings et al.\n(1987) also examined the dollar threshold at which a misstatement or nondisclosure in the measurement\nof an item becomes material.\nIn essence, Boatsman and Robertson (1974) concluded that the judgement processes of CPAs and\nsecurity analysts do not differ. Firth (1979) showed that there is wide diversity in opinions about whether\nitems need to be separately disclosed or not. Chief accountants in industrial and commercial firms (as\na proxy for preparers) wanted to disclose the least information. Auditors wanted to disclose more, and\ninvestment analysts and bank-lending officers (as a proxy for the users) wanted the most extensive\ndisclosure. Jennings et al. (1987) assessed the degree of consensus on various disclosure issues. They\ntested both within and among three groups: CPAs, various user groups and officers of the court. Their\nfindings suggest a great variation in all groups within as well as across cases. Jennings et al. (1991)\nresearched materiality from the perspective of auditors and of lawyers and judges (where lawyers and\njudges are expected to be a reasonable proxy for users). Auditors had the lowest levels of disclosure, that\nis, wanted to disclose less. Lawyers and judges had the highest standards of disclosure.\nAccording to Agrawal and Chatterjee (2015), the last decades the quality of financial information\nreceived increased attention. Surprisingly, based on literature, it can also be concluded that no research\nhas been published on the materiality for the financial statements as a whole and that knowledge of\nmateriality as part of the audit expectation gap is based on limited empirical research. Moreover, our\nknowledge is based on either experiments or on a survey and there is only one study that examined the\ngap between auditors and preparers. That paper found that preparers wanted to disclose the least infor-\nmation and hence had the highest materiality. In their review article, Messier et al. (2005, p. 157)\nsummarized the results of research until 1982:2 `There were considerable differences between users,\npreparers, and auditors with respect to materiality thresholds. In general, users demonstrated lower\nmateriality thresholds than preparers or auditors; the materiality thresholds for auditors tended to be\nbetween those of preparers and users'.\nThe approach of using experiments or surveys to study materiality gaps as part of the audit expectation\ngap has several shortcomings. First, previous research may contain a bias because of the absence of real-\nworld pressures, such as those associated with clients and liability (Boatsman & Robertson, 1974,\np. 346). Power (2003, p. 379) expresses it as follows: `... very little is known about auditing in practical,\nas opposed to experimental, settings'. The reason why so little practical research has been done, according\nto Power (2003, p. 380), is: `There is very little of what is now called \"field work\" in auditing.\nThe apparent reason for this is that professional service firms are reluctant to provide research access to\nclient data and to live audit assignments.' Second, experiments are typically based on a specific case\ndescription. The nature of the case, and the items for which materiality is assessed differ widely.\nIn experiments, quite often it was asked if a specific situation was material or not. The nature of the items\ndiffers, with a wide range of situations, such as concerning write-down of inventory, price of a stock, etc.\n`With such a wide range of items or events examined, it is difficult to generalize these results because the\nrelative importance of each of these items may vary significantly' (Holstrum & Messier, 1982, p. 57).\nFinally, it may be noted that earlier research focused on disclosure decisions to examine whether a\ncertain item is material or not. This is another scope limitation, because as assumed by Messier (Messier,\nrelated) decisions'.\nObjective and Rationale of the Study\nThis study investigates the audit expectation gap between companies and their auditors measured by the\nmateriality for financial statements as a whole. Previous materiality gap research has focused on the\nuser\u00adpreparer materiality gap and not on the preparer\u00adauditor materiality gap, which is also an important\naspect of the audit process. Outcome will indicate companies' perceptions on the level of verification\ndone by the auditor.\nMethodology and Results\nResearch Approach and Data Source\nIn this study, the analysis of the materiality gap is based on a sample of auditor and preparer perceptions\nof materiality with respect to the same financial statements. To complement prior experimental research\nwith real-life data, an attempt was made to obtain materiality assessments for a set of actual financial\nstatements, inviting each preparer to consider materiality in terms of his or her company's own financial\nstatements.\nObviously, any research of this kind, though potentially highly relevant, is severely hindered by\nconfidentiality requirements that are imposed on auditors (see, for instance, IFAC Code of Ethics for\nProfessional Accountants, Section 140). It requires the cooperation of an audit firm which is willing to\nconduct most of the data gathering itself and to provide the data to the researcher in a format that\nguarantees the anonymity of the company.\nThis research is based on the 2007 financial statements of Dutch companies. At that time, materiality\nwas defined by Dutch auditing standards using an exact translation of the definition contained in ISA320\nat that time. Cooperation was obtained from a Dutch member firm of the IFAC Forum of Firms member\nbody. The data collection was carried out by an employee of the audit firm. The firm was willing to\nprovide information for the year 2007 with respect to 29 companies, selected by the firm on the basis of\ngeneral instructions by the researcher: cases were selected at random from among nonlisted companies\nwith clean audit opinions. The audit firm excluded two companies from the original selection for reasons\nthat cannot be disclosed because of confidentiality. The reasons were explained to the researcher, who\nconcluded that there was no basis for assuming that these reasons were related to the companies' or the\nauditors' materiality judgements.\nFor each of these companies, the audit firm was asked to provide the following information:\n\u00b7 Information on total assets, sales and results before taxes for the year 2007 in a format that ensured\nthe anonymity of the company.\n\u00b7 The materiality level for the financial statements as a whole, applied in auditing these financial\nstatements, as reported in the audit file (as mentioned in ISA 320.10).\n\u00b7 An assessment of the materiality level for the financial statements as a whole by the preparer of the\nfinancial statements.\nThe companies' perception of materiality was based on a brief survey sent by the audit firm to the\ncompanies they audit. The audit firm was instructed to address the survey to the CFO or the financial\ncontroller of the company. In the survey, it was made clear that the survey had an academic purpose.\nAs well as responding to some general questions, each preparer was asked to answer the following\nquestion with respect to their own company: `What amount, in Euros, do you think is material in your\nannual financial statements for the year 2007?' (translated from Dutch).\nIn the end, 16 companies provided responses to the questionnaire, of which 12 were useable. Three\nrespondents did not provide a number for materiality. One observation was omitted because it was clearly\nbased on a misunderstanding of the question (the materiality threshold provided was greater than the\nbalance sheet total of that company).\nTwo observations are noteworthy: one respondent turned out to be a former employee of the audit\nfirm who knew the exact materiality threshold that was used,3 and one observation was considered to be\nof doubtful value as the preparer reported a materiality threshold of zero.4 Both observations have been\nretained, but it has been ascertained that the removal of these observations would not have significantly\naffected the results.\nFinally, to obtain further insight, the audit partners were asked to answer some questions about\nmateriality and the materiality gap.\nAnalysis\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics on the companies' materiality levels of auditors and preparers as\nwell as firm characteristics.\nSales, which is a measure for a company's size, varies from 4 million euro to 82 million euro.\nThe materiality threshold according to the auditors divided by total assets range from 1.05 to 5.00 per\ncent. The materiality threshold according to the preparers divided by total assets range from 0.00 to 1.39\nper cent. This indicates that preparers have lower materiality thresholds. As a paired comparison, it\nappears that this result holds not just on average, but is true in all individual cases, with the exception of\none case where the auditor and the preparer had the same perception of the materiality. When we define\na variable GAP as (auditor materiality\u00adpreparer materiality), we find that this variable is never negative,\nalthough in one set of results it is equal to zero. GAP/TA ranges from 0 to 5 per cent. The mean is 1.78\nper cent, which implies that the materiality threshold of the auditor scaled by total assets is on average\nTo test whether the difference in materiality threshold between auditors and preparers is significant, a\ntwo-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used. As expected, because the materiality threshold of the\npreparers is always lower than the materiality threshold of the auditors, the difference between the two\nis highly significant (z-value of \u00ad2.934).\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics\nMin. Max. Mean Median Std. Dev.\nSource: Author's calculations.\nNotes:\nThe descriptive statistics are based on 12 observations. GAP is defined as Materiality threshold auditors \u00ad Materiality\nthreshold companies. GAP/TA is defined as (Materiality threshold auditors - Materiality threshold companies)/total\nassets.\nTo assess the preparers' understanding of the concept of materiality, the researcher also asked the\npreparers, with an open question, to provide a definition of materiality. Seven out of the twelve\nrespondents gave a definition in line with ISA 320. Five preparers did not answer this question. Whether\npreparers responded to this question or not is unrelated to size of the firm, measured by total assets.\n(Tested by a Mann\u00adWhitney test, p = 0.935.) This suggests that an understanding of the concept of\nmateriality is unrelated to the size of the firm. The value of GAP/TA is, however, related to whether\npreparers did or did not give a proper definition of materiality. The value of GAP/TA of the subsample\nthat gave a correct definition was higher than for the group that did not give a definition (tested by\nMann\u00adWhitney test, p = 0.030). If we assume that the group that gave a definition has, on average, a\ngreater understanding of the concept of materiality, then the results suggest an understanding of the\nconcept of materiality leads to a larger gap. Finally, tests were carried out to determine whether larger\nenterprises have a greater understanding of materiality and if--because of this--the reported gap would\nbe smaller. If this is the case than one would also expect that the materiality gap scaled by total assets is\nnegatively correlated with size. This turns out not to be the case. The Spearman correlation coefficient is\nAt the same time that the survey was sent to the companies audited by the audit firm, a survey was\nalso sent out to the audit partners of the audit firm involved to acquire insights about materiality and\nabout the communication of materiality by the audit partners. Ten surveys were sent out, and nine audit\npartners responded. It was not revealed to the researcher which of these audit partners were involved in\nthe audits selected for the preparer survey. First, the audit partners were asked whether they communicate\nthe level of the materiality to the companies audited. One audit partner answered `never', four audit\npartners, `occasionally' and four audit partners, `regularly'. None of the audit partners reported that they\n`always' communicate the materiality threshold. Based on the answers of the audit partners, one would\nexpect the materiality gap to be smaller: four out of the nine audit partners reported that they regularly\ncommunicate the materiality threshold to the companies audited. The next question asked was whether\nthe audit partner expected a materiality gap to exist. Seven audit partners responded that they did; one\npartner indicated that (s)he did not. One audit partner did not reply to this question.\nIn the survey, some space was left blank for additional remarks. Two audit partners provided insightful\ncomments: one audit partner responded that he does not communicate the materiality threshold because\nthere are two possible reactions. In case the materiality threshold of the auditor is lower than that of the\npreparers, the response would generally be that `auditors are expensive'. The other feasible response\ncould be that companies will be dissatisfied because they think that auditors do not pay (sufficient)\nattention to amounts below the materiality thresholds. One audit partner reported, correctly, as it turned\nout, that companies probably have lower materiality thresholds. This implies more work, but who would\nwant to pay for that additional amount of work?\nDiscussion, Limitations and Suggestions for Further Research\nDiscussion\nWhereas previous empirical research into the materiality gap has focused mainly on disclosure decisions,\nthis study examines the materiality gap in the primary financial statements. This research examines the\nquantitative materiality threshold applied to the financial statements as a whole rather than to specific\nline items. The willingness of the audit firm to participate in this research provided a unique insight into\nthe differences between materiality perceptions of auditors and the companies they audit. The cooperation\nof an audit firm also imposed significant restrictions on the research, especially with respect to sample\nsize as well as the limited amount of information provided on the company's characteristics and other\nrelevant features in each audit that might have had an impact on materiality levels.\nNevertheless, the results are of interest. The findings of this research indicate that companies assume\nlower materiality levels compared to their auditors. On average, the materiality threshold of the auditors,\nscaled by total assets, was 1.78 per cent higher. Even though the number of observations in the current\nstudy is small, the fact that companies' perceptions were lower (or equal) in all cases lends credibility to\nthese findings concerning the materiality gap.\nThree possible explanations for the difference in results compared to previous research are as follows:\nFirst, the difference may be caused by the fact that this study used real-life data as opposed to experiments.\nOne might speculate that a greater familiarity with their respective organizations, including all the\npotential problems an auditor might encounter, would invite preparers to evaluate materiality thresholds\nat a lower level in their own organization as opposed to an hypothetical situation. When using real-life\ndata, it is also possible that auditors, when faced with the cost constraints of a real audit, will respond\ndifferently to materiality issues than when answering hypothetical questions, where socially desirable\nresponses may also play a role. A second possible explanation might be the time difference between this\nstudy and prior research. Preparers currently face an increasing number of legal claims, and the legal\nenvironment puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the preparer. Third, a possible explanation is in\nthe nature of the materiality issue studied. Whereas previous research investigated disclosure issues, this\nstudy looks at the quantitative materiality threshold. With respect to disclosure, preparers may be more\nreluctant to disclose information because of proprietary information costs, but on the other hand, with\nrespect to the reliability of the information provided they may be more demanding.\nTaken at face value, the outcome of the current study suggests that companies expect auditors to\nengage in more detailed verification than they actually do. At the least, this indicates that the work of\nthe auditor is not fully observable by the company. Whether it means that the auditor underperformed\nin the perception of the preparer, or that preparer perceptions are based on unrealistic assumptions about\nthe nature and actual costs of auditing, cannot be determined on the basis of this research.\nThough limited in scope, the research reported in this exploratory study provides sufficient indication\nthat our understanding of the materiality gap as reflected in the existing research literature is incomplete.\nAn important issue in any further research, of course, is to obtain the cooperation of more audit firms.\nThis research shows that there are ways to allow firms to cooperate while respecting the need to maintain\nconfidentiality. Although in the short term the outcome of this study--that companies expect higher\nmateriality levels than auditors actually apply--does not seem to be in the interests of the audit firms\nthemselves, in the long run the profession is likely to be strengthened by the removal of misunderstanding\nand ambiguity concerning the limitations and costs of an audit.\nLimitations\nThe process of selecting companies is of vital importance. Given that the selection was carried out by the\naudit firm, it cannot be ruled out that the sample chosen for this study was not fully random. As far as\ncan be ascertained by the researcher, however, the companies were selected randomly, and the process\nof eliminating two companies from the sample was made transparent to the researcher. If, nonetheless,\nselection had been to some extent nonrandom, the most likely result would have been that the findings\nunderstate the materiality gap. Given that the audit firm was aware of the research question, it might have\nbeen inclined to select companies expected to have a good understanding of materiality.\nThe preparers were not previously informed of the research question, but it is possible that they\nanticipated that their answers would be compared with those of the auditors. This might have led to a\nreporting bias if the preparers returned relatively low materiality thresholds to signal any belief they may\nhave held that audits are too expensive.\nWhile the sample includes a considerable size range, it does not include large, listed companies. It is\nconceivable that in larger, listed firms, there is a better understanding of audit matters so that any\nmateriality gap between auditors and preparers will be smaller. Nevertheless, it is not likely that the\nfindings of this study can be attributed solely to the level of knowledge. If that were the case, a negative\nrelationship between size and the gap would have been expected.\nThe way in which the size of the audit firm influences the results is rather difficult to estimate. From\nliterature, we know that auditors from large national audit firms have higher materiality thresholds\ncompared to auditors from small audit firms (see Messier et al., 2005, p. 157): the audit firm which\nparticipated in this study is a member of an IFAC Forum of Firms, but not a big-4 audit firm.\nFinally, the paper is based on 2007 data. However, I do not expect the outcome to be different in more\nrecent years as no attempts have been made by neither the regulator nor the auditors to decrease the gap,\nfor example, by better communication on materiality.\nSuggestions for Further Research\nProvided further cooperation from audit firms can be obtained, there are multiple avenues available for\nfurther research. Apart from research that confirms the existence of a preparer\u00adauditor materiality gap,\nthe results reported in this paper suggest that more work should be done to explore the determinants of\nthe materiality gap:\n\u00b7 Does the level of knowledge of audit procedures have an impact on the company's perceptions of\nmateriality thresholds? Does this differ for listed as opposed to nonlisted firms? It would also be\ninteresting to split the gap into a performance gap and reasonableness gap (cf. Porter, 1993, p. 50).\n\u00b7 Who do auditors see as the users of the financial statement and who do preparers see as the users?\nDoes this influence what they think to be material?\n\u00b7 Although it might be difficult to discern, it may be interesting to test whether the level of materiality\nthresholds is influenced by the rising number of lawsuits involving auditors and preparers.\n\u00b7 Does the fee structure (fixed fee or variable fee based on hours) influence the level of the materiality\nof the auditor? Based on the definition of materiality, fee structure should not be one of the\ndeterminants of the level of materiality, but real-life pressure in combination with fixed fee may\ninfluence the auditor's materiality threshold.\nIf the existence of a materiality gap is confirmed, more general questions can be asked regarding the\nevaluation and economic significance of such a gap. The issue of which party is `right' in its materiality\nthreshold assessment should be answered by relating materiality threshold assessments to the perceptions\nof costs and the benefits of an audit. As it is not evident that consensus on the appropriate effort by the\nauditor already exists, an interesting question is whether the consensus can be encouraged by improving\ndisclosure about materiality levels, or, more generally, enhancing communication on this point between\nauditor and the company audited. In general, it seems appropriate to conclude that, at any rate with\nrespect to materiality, the contracting between auditors and companies audited is an area that requires\nfurther research.\n"
