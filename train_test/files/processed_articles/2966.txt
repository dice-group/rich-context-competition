Inter-\nactions of age and sex with BMI terms\nwere not included because of our in-\nterest in estimating the average effect\nof overweight or obesity across both\nsexes and all adult ages. Although it is\ninteresting to examine how obesity ef-\nfects differ by age, sex, race, and other\nfactors, the purpose of this article is to\nestimate total societal obesity burden\nin terms of mortality. However, our\nanalysis does take into account differ-\nential effects of obesity by age and sex\ndespite no corresponding interaction\nterms, simply by including both sexes\nand a cross section of ages in the deri-\nvation samples. For example, if there\nwere an equal number of men and\nwomen in a sample with equal obesity\nrates by sex, and the RR of death given\nwomen, the estimated RR for the com-\nbined group would be 1.75; using this\nRR for the whole sample combined, we\nwould get the same answer as if num-\nber of attributable deaths in women and\nmen were calculated separately and\nadded together.

For example, Stevens et\nal33 found that HR for obesity de-\ncreased steadily with advancing age.\nHence, if cohort age distributions vary,\nthis disparity could yield different av-\nerage HRs associated with BMI.

Thus, these analy-\nses may underestimate risks of excess\nweight. In analyses controlling for these\nvariables (using CPS1 and NHS data),\nmean annual number of deaths attrib-\nutable to obesity was estimated to be\nSmoking has received much atten-\ntion in BMI and mortality analyses.

The exclusion of subjects with\na potentially confounding trait yields\nHRs free of confounding by the trait, but\nvalidity of application of the HRs to a\nmixedpopulation(withandwithoutthe\ntrait) cannot be known with certainty.\nThe differences observed between\nanalyses based on HRs from all subjects\nvs those from nonsmokers or never-\nsmokers prompts the question, \"Which\nof the estimates presented is more rea-\nsonable?\" If one is prepared to believe\nthat in self-defined smokers, there is no\nvariation in the degree to which per-\nsons are exposed to those components\nof cigarettes that influence both body\nweight and mortality rate (ie, all smok-\ners smoke an identical amount in an\nidentical way or at least that the classi-\nfication into smokers and nonsmokers\nreasonably captures the biological\nmechanism[s] by which smoking influ-\nences mortality rates), then there is no\nresidual confounding by smoking after\ncontrolling for it statistically or by strati-\nfication. In this case, best estimates of\nBMI's causal effect on mortality rate will\ncomefromasampleofbothsmokersand\nnonsmokers (top part of Table 4). Al-\nternately,ifoneispreparedtobelievethat\nthe causal effect of BMI on mortality rate\nis identical for all levels of smoking sta-\ntus (ie, no interaction or effect modifi-\ncation), then samples of never-smokers\nshould give more unbiased estimates of\nthe true effect of BMI on mortality rate,\nevenformixedpopulationsconsistingof\nboth smokers and nonsmokers (bot-\ntom part of Table 4). Finally, for those\nwho think there may be both residual\nconfounding among smokers and ef-\nfectmodification,thebestestimatesmay\nlie between the top and bottom parts\nof Table 4. Similar comments apply to\nexclusion of individuals whose weight\nfluctuates or who are apparently un-\nhealthy. With respect to whether\nresidual confounding or effect modifi-\ncation is likely, the literature is di-\nboth with and without smokers, sug-\ngests that there is some effect modifica-\ntion or residual confounding. However,\nthe effect of eliminating smokers from\nthe data set does not seem to be a low-\nering of risk in the very lean nor a low-\nering of the BMI mortality curve nadir,\nbutratheraslightincreaseinobesityhaz-\nard relative to average-weight persons.\nWe have no way of knowing whether\nresidual confounding or effect modifi-\ncation is the more likely explanation.\nThere are several limitations of the\ncurrent analysis that may point to fu-\nture investigations. We analyzed BMI\nat a single point in time only, and it\nwould be interesting to evaluate mor-\ntality as a function of BMI changes. Also,\nour calculations assume that all (con-\ntrolling for age, sex, and smoking) ex-\ncess mortality in obese people is due to\nobesity. However, it is not definitively\nestablished that if currently obese per-\nsons were to lose weight or were to\nnever become obese, they would not\nstill have a higher mortality rate. Also,\nour estimates may be biased toward\nhigher numbers due to confounding by\nunknown factors. Given these consid-\nerations, studies of the potential mor-\ntality-reducing effects of intentional\nweight loss by medically advisable pro-\ncedures in obese persons would be of\ngreat benefit. Also, we chose BMI cut-\noffs for overweight and obesity used by\nthe NIH and WHO. Had we set the BMI\nthresholds higher, the number of at-\ntributable deaths would have been re-\nduced. Alternately, had we relied only\non studies in which the BMI-mortality\nassociation increases in a monotonic\n(not \"U-shaped\") manner34 and set ei-\nther the threshold for overweight and\nthe reference category lower, the num-\nber of attributable deaths would have\nincreased substantially.\nRegarding generalizability, our esti-\nmates are national estimates for the\noverall population of US adults, be-\ncause the BMI distribution on which\nour calculations are based is derived\nfrom a nationally representative sample\n(NHANES III). Therefore, the overall\nestimates will be valid for the US adult\npopulation to the extent that our HR\nestimates, which in only 1 case are\nbased on a nationally representative\nsample, are valid estimates for the US\npopulation. Most of our samples over-\nrepresent whites and may have over-\nrepresented middle- and upper-\nsocioeconomic status subjects. The sole\nnationally representative sample\n(NHEFS) yielded slightly lower esti-\nmates than the others. Our estimates are\nbeyond, 2 factors are likely to increase\nthe number of obesity-attributable\ndeaths: continued growth in popula-\ntion size, and the apparently continu-\ning increase in both the population pro-\nportion that is obese and severely\nobese.1 Indeed, this latter trend im-\nplies that our approach to calculating\nrisks in BMI categories (vs a continu-\nous model) with older data sets prob-\nably underestimates the total number\nof deaths due to obesity in general and\nin the highest BMI category in particu-\nlar. However, this may be offset by the\nfact that when most of the cohort stud-\nies used were initiated, there were fewer\nintervention strategies to reduce risk\nfactors associated with obesity and\nfewer medical therapies for postpon-\ning death from obesity-related dis-\neases. An increase in the efficacy and\navailability of such interventions would\nreduce HRs associated with obesity.\nOur estimates are limited to a soci-\netal rather than individual perspective.\nIt would be interesting to use BMI-\nmortalitydatatocalculateexpectedyears\nof life lost for the individual. In such an\nanalysis by Stevens et al,45 this way of\nviewing the burden of obesity showed\nthat moderate obesity generally results\nin a 1- to 3-year reduction in life expec-\ntancy, depending on age. It would also\nbe interesting to examine cause-\nspecific mortality, which we have not\ndone in this article. Integrating cause-\nspecific mortalities (T.B.V. and J.E.M.,\nates a total that can serve as a validity\ncheck on the current results; prelimi-\nnary findings show consistency be-\ntween those results and results herein.\nObesity is a major cause of mortality\nin the United States. Aside from mor-\ntality rate, however, obesity substan-\ntially increases morbidity4 and impairs\nqualityoflife.46 Inessence,thehealthim-\npact of obesity far exceeds what we have\npresented herein. This, combined with\nthe relative consistency in the esti-\nmates from the 6 cohort studies, makes\nit clear that obesity is a major public\nhealth problem in the United States.\n"
