Sexual selection will have favored preferences for facial traits\nwhich are associated with reproductive success (Rhodes, 2006). Facial preferences may\ntherefore exhibit the characteristics of a system designed for the identification of high\nquality mates (Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999). One way facial traits may signal mate\nquality is by indicating the health of the individual displaying them. Healthy individuals\nconfer a reduced risk of infection as well as the possibility of heritable immunity for their\nFemale facial appearance and health\nsuitors' offspring (Hamilton and Zuk, 1982). Preferences for facial traits that are linked\nwith health are therefore expected to be present.\nOne facial cue used in the judgment of a woman's attractiveness is facial\nfemininity. While facial proportions diverge between the sexes in particular ways, within\neach sex, the extent to which an individual typifies the prototypical face structure of his or\nher sex varies. Given that women have smaller jaws, lighter brow-ridges, higher\ncheekbones and larger foreheads than men (Enlow and Hans 1996; Penton-Voak et al,\n2001), facial femininity represents the degree to which such traits are exaggerated in a\nwoman's face.\nFolstad and Karter (1992) suggest that sexually dimorphic traits in males signal\nimmunocompetence because the sex hormones responsible for their manifestation are\nimmunosuppressive (e.g., testosterone) (Alexander and Stimson, 1988; M\u00f8ller, Christe, and\nLux, 1999, but see Roberts, Buchanan, and Evans, 2004; Boonekamp, Ros, and Verhulst,\n2008). As a consequence, male facial masculinity may honestly signal immune system\nquality since only the healthiest males can afford the costs to immune functionality of high\nlevels of testosterone (for discussion of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, see\nRhodes, Chan, Zebrowitz, and Simmons, 2003), although some have recently urged caution\nsuggested alternative mechanisms (Alonso-Alvarez et al., 2007).\nThe handicap hypothesis may not be applicable to female facial femininity, since\nestrogen, which gives rise to feminine facial features in women (Law-Smith et al., 2006), is\nnot clearly immunosuppressive. While estrogen is positively associated with endometrial,\nbreast, and ovarian cancers (Service, 1998), it is also linked with the production and action\nof antibodies (Alexander and Stimson, 1988). Thus estrogen may prove detrimental to cell-\nmediated immunity, but beneficial to humoral immunity (Da Silva, 1999). In light of this, it\nmay be appropriate to consider female facial femininity as a direct signal of health, with\nestrogen partially augmenting immune function. Indeed facial femininity in women has\nbeen shown to be positively correlated with other putative cues to health, such as facial\nsymmetry (Little et al., 2008) and skin condition (Fink, Grammer, and Matts, 2006).\nCurrently only two studies have addressed a link between female facial femininity\nand direct indices of health (Rhodes et al., 2003; Thornhill and Gangestad, 2006). Whereas\nRhodes et al. (2003) found that a woman's rated facial femininity was unrelated to her\nhealth as assessed by medical records, Thornhill and Gangestad (2006) found a significant\npositive correlation between measured female facial femininity and number of self-reported\nrespiratory infections in the last three years. However Thornhill and Gangestad (2006)\nfound no association between measured female facial femininity and reported frequency of\nstomach illness or antibiotic use across this time period. This suggests that facial\nfemininity, if linked with immune function, may be best conceived as related to particular\ncomponents of the immune system rather than a global immune response.\nHowever, both of the aforementioned studies possess methodological flaws that\nhinder the reliability of their findings. While Thornhill and Gangestad (2006) could be said\nto have employed a superior methodology to Rhodes et al. (2003) with respect to the\nquality of the images used, their study employed a health measure susceptible to memory\nfailure and bias (e.g., one assessment requesting recall of illness within the last three years).\nFemale facial appearance and health\nIt is possible, for example, that the less feminine faced may have had a bias to recall more\nnegative events than their more feminine counterparts, perhaps mediated by self-esteem\nand mood (Rhodes, 2006). Furthermore, both studies looked at how health patterns\ntemporally predict facial appearance and did not consider whether facial appearance can\npredict later health. This distinction is important as it may be that illness affects growth\nwithout the factors which drive growth having an impact on immune functioning. For\nexample, meta-analyses of experimental work in nonhuman males suggests that while\nincreasing testosterone may not affect immune parameters, exposure to pathogens may\ndown-regulate testosterone production (Boonekamp, Ros, and Verhulst, 2008).\nAccordingly, the present study sought to address the relationship between female\nfacial femininity, attractiveness and perceived/actual health. It was assumed that for\nfemininity to signal health, it must be perceived as healthy and consequently be rated as\nattractive. Actual health was assessed by multiple self-reports detailing the number of\ncolds, stomach illnesses and frequency of antibiotic use across a number of time periods,\nincluding some more recent and therefore less susceptible to error than previous studies\nemploying such a measure (i.e., Thornhill and Gangestad, 2006). Based on previous\nresults, we would predict that the rated femininity, healthiness and attractiveness of the\nfaces would negatively correlate with self-reported ill-health (especially upper-respiratory\ninfections although not necessarily stomach bugs) in shorter-term time periods, as well as\nover the preceding three years.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Photograph Collection\nOne hundred and five female undergraduates aged 18-20 years (mean age=18.5)\nwere recruited from the University's Psychology and Biology departments in partial\nexchange for course credit. Of these, 54 were from the 2009 student cohort and 51 were\nAll students had been photographed on entry to their degree program and gave\npermission for their departmental portrait to be used in the research project. Each\nparticipant was photographed in a \"portrait\" pose, under diffuse flash in a windowless\nroom. All images were black-masked to conceal clothing, hair, neck, and ears, and were\naligned to match on interpupillary distance.\nQuestionnaire Data\nTime 1 questions. Within two weeks of commencing their courses and being\nphotographed, the 2009 cohorts were recruited and asked to report the number of bouts of\n\"colds or flu\", the number of \"stomach bugs\" they had suffered, and the number of\noccasions on which they had taken antibiotics in both the preceding three years, and 12\nmonths. Due to poor participant retention to Time 2 in the first cohort, the 2010 cohort\nwere recruited at Time 2 and asked to report the same information for the one and three\nyears prior to arriving at university. All participants were also asked to report whether they\nhad any immune system disorders (none were reported) and whether they had suffered any\nFemale facial appearance and health\nillness at the time of being photographed (63 participants reported illness here, but this did\nnot relate to any facial ratings so was not examined further). The 2010 cohort were also\nasked to indicate whether they were \"probably wearing make-up\" when the departmental\nphotograph was taken.\nTime 2 questions. All participants completed a second questionnaire during the final\nweek of the autumn term in mid-December (as noted above, the 2010 cohort completed\nboth questionnaires at this time). They were asked to report the number of days in the\npreceding eight weeks in which they had suffered a cold, the flu, a stomach bug, taken\nantibiotics, or had a day off due to illness (specifically excluding precautionary measures\ndue to the 2009 Swine flu epidemic when the UK health authorities urged people not to go\nin even if symptoms were mild).\nAll variables collected via health questionnaires were analyzed individually. While\ndata reduction techniques may have reduced Type I error rate, it is important to note that\ncertain variables were not expected to show significant correlations (i.e. the stomach bugs)\nas they are more susceptible to various lifestyle factors such as food hygiene and period\npain and may not be reliable indicators of immune functioning, as per Thornhill and\nGangestad's (2006) argument. Likewise, we explicitly wanted to look at the different time\nperiods separately. As such, data reduction was inappropriate and similarly these\ncorrelations were not all viewed as part of the same \"family\" for multiple comparison\npurposes (e.g., see Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).\nRatings\nRatings of femininity were used in the present study. Such ratings are affected in\nthe predicted way by systematic and objective manipulation of sexually dimorphic cues in\nface images (Welling et al., 2007) and have been shown to be positively correlated with\nmeasured estrogen level (Law Smith et al., 2006).\nObservers were recruited via an opportunity sample of those within Durham\nUniversity campus. Eleven females and four males with a mean age of 23.7 years (age\nrange 18-37) rated the faces. While observer knowledge of the experimental participants\nwas not considered, it is unlikely that any observers knew any of the experimental\nparticipants personally.\nStimuli were presented individually on a laptop display (screen size = 1020 x 780,\nstimulus resolution= 400 x 500 pixels). Observers were asked to rate each face on\nfemininity, health, mood or attractiveness, from 1 (very\nmasculine/unhealthy/sad/unattractive) to 7 (very feminine/healthy/happy/attractive). They\nwere also asked to rate each face for the degree of makeup they suspected had been applied\nfrom 1 (none) to 3 (a lot).\nResponses were made by pressing the chosen number on the keyboard and then\nconfirming this response with the enter key. Raters were given as long as needed to\ncomplete each trial and subsequent trials would only be presented on completion of\nprevious ones. For each of the five dimensions, raters were required to judge all of the\nfaces. The order in which raters assessed each dimension was randomized, as was the order\nin which the trials appeared within that block.\nFemale facial appearance and health\nInter-rater agreement for each trial was acceptable to excellent for all five\n0.94; mood 0.95). As rated makeup and report of wearing makeup in the images showed a\nsignificant positive correlation (r = .489, p = <0.001), rated makeup was considered an\nappropriate control for the presence of makeup in the analysis. It was not possible to use\nmake-up itself as a control measure as only a subset of participants provided data on it.\nResults\nDue to the swine flu epidemic of 2009 potentially creating cohort effects, all\nreported illness was standardised within cohort before data were merged for analysis. As\nratings were acquired from different observers in 2009 versus 2010, in order to rule out any\ndifferences in ratings (although as above Cronbach's scores were good for both sets), all\nscores were standardised within cohort.\nTable 1. Intercorrelations between the facial rating measures\nRated health Rated facial\nattractiveness\nRated facial\nfemininity\nRated\nmood\nRated facial\nattractiveness\nRated facial\nfemininity\nRated\nmakeup\nInitial correlation analyses (see Table 1) showed that rated health, femininity,\nattractiveness, and makeup were significantly positively related across faces (p =< .001). In\naddition, rated mood correlated positively with rated health, although this relationship was\nonly marginally significant (p = .093). Furthermore, health, femininity, and attractiveness\nratings remained significantly positively related when controlling for rated makeup and\nFemale facial appearance and health\nTable 2.

To remove the possibility that a\nparticipant's degree of makeup and happiness of expression in the photographs were\nconfounding the relationships between rated health, attractiveness, and femininity with\nreported health, rated mood and makeup were controlled for within the analysis.\nTable 3.

Similarly, there were significant negative\nrelationships between antibiotic use, rated facial attractiveness, and femininity, such that\nmore attractive and feminine women reported significantly or marginally less antibiotic use\n(all rs > 0.17, all ps < 0.1, see Table 3 for figures). There was also a marginal negative\ncorrelation between rated health and reported antibiotic use in the last twelve months (r =\n-.172, p =.095). There were no other significant relationships (see Table 3).\nTable 4.

That is,\nwomen whose faces appeared more feminine in early October reported experiencing fewer\ndays of flu in November and December. Importantly, although the N for the prospective\ndata was smaller, results for colds and antibiotic use did not approach coefficient\nmagnitudes which would be significant with about 100 participants as in our previous\nanalyses, suggesting that these null correlations are not due to reduced sample size.\nDiscussion\nThe present study addressed the relationship between rated female facial femininity,\nattractiveness, health, and susceptibility to infectious disease. It was predicted that all three\nrating variables would correlate negatively with bouts of illness, particularly with colds and\nflu suffered, although not necessarily with rates of stomach infections. The results showed\nFemale facial appearance and health\npartial support for this prediction, in that there was a general trend for both facial\nfemininity and attractiveness to correlate negatively with reported number of colds in the\npreceding twelve months and with frequency of antibiotic use in the last three years and the\nlast twelve months. Rated facial femininity (as documented in October) was also associated\nwith days of flu experienced in the period spanning the November-December months. No\nother significant results were obtained.\nThe current findings that only some illness indices are associated with facial ratings\nsupports the results of Thornhill and Gangestad (2006) who found no association between\nfemale facial femininity and frequency of antibiotic use, or number of reported stomach\nbugs. However they did find a negative relationship between facial femininity and\nrespiratory infection. These findings suggest that it may be inaccurate to conceive of a\n\"unitary\" or \"global\" immune system, as doing so may obscure potential relationships\nbetween facial rating variables and individual illness categories. The non-significant\nrelationship between facial femininity and health in Rhodes et al (2003) may perhaps be\ndue to the unitary annual health score they employed as their health measure. Femininity\nmay not therefore signal an augmentation of global immunity, but rather increased\nresistance to some infectious diseases over others (non-human evidence suggests that\ndisease resistance can be pathogen specific and that immune function is more multi-faceted\nthan behavioral research tends to assume; see Muehlenbein and Bribiescas, 2005, for a\nreview).\nIn disagreement with previous research (Roberts et al., 2005, Kalick, Zebrowitz,\nLanglois, and Johnson, 1998., Little et al., 2011) the current study found no significant\nrelationship between perceived health and actual health indices (albeit one marginal result\nwith antibiotic use in the last twelve months). This is a striking finding given that the\nabsence of such a relationship in the present sample cannot be accounted for by the\nconfounding effects of mood and makeup or by the possibility that apparent health\nrepresents current condition and not long term disease resistance (i.e., reported illness on\nday of photograph was not associated with rated health). It may be that, as above, apparent\nhealth relates to some aspects of actual health and not others. Alternatively, wider factors\nmay have influenced our results. For instance, recent research has suggested that diet\n(Stephen, Coetzee, and Perrett, 2011) and facial adiposity (Coetzee et al., 2011) are related\nto rated health. As diet and facial adiposity where not controlled for it is possible that they\nconfounded the relationship between perceived and actual health. Furthermore given the\nsubtle coloration changes linked with a healthy appearance (i.e., increased redness and\nyellowness; Stephen, Smith, Stirrat, and Perrett, 2009), the lack of standardized lighting\nand screen calibration at the rating stage of the experiment may have presented an\nadditional confound.\nIt is also possible that rated and actual health failed to be associated due to a\nweakness in the study's assessment of health. While the present study employed self-report\nof both remote and recent illness, the potential for memory failure, although reduced\nrelative to previous studies (Thornhill and Gangestad, 2006), remains. It would therefore be\ninteresting to see if the present results are replicated using more objective measures of\nhealth. One avenue would be to examine the relationship between rated facial femininity,\nhealth, and attractiveness and oxidative damage (a cause of a host of diseases; Velando,\nFemale facial appearance and health\nTorres, and Alonso-Alvarez, 2008) to women's proteins, lipids, and DNA (see Gangestad,\nMerriman and Thompson, 2010, for such a study using male participants).\nThe second aim of this study was to compare the ability of facial features to indicate\npast versus predicting future health. While there is a broad pattern of facial femininity and\nattractiveness indicating elements of past health (7 out of 12 predicted correlations were\nsignificant or borderline in the correct direction), there was less evidence when considering\nthe two month period after the photographs were taken. Indeed, there was only one out of\n12 anticipated correlations (given the expectation that stomach bugs would not be\nsignificant) raising the very real possibility of a Type I error. It may be that 8 weeks was\ninsufficient time for participants' immune systems to sufficiently differentiate; however the\nfirst term of university was selected specifically because the exposure to novel pathogens\nfrom a wide range of areas of the country/globe represented a time in which susceptibility\nought to be important. Thus it may be that female facial femininity is a valid index of past\nhealth experiences (perhaps due to illness and pathogen exposure modulating sex hormones\nduring late adolescence when our sample would still have been developing) without being a\nvalid predictor of current or future health functioning. Future research, however, should\nlook at future health over a longer time period to ensure that the time span difference here\ndid not give insufficient future-health data.\nFinally, it is important to acknowledge that the association between facial\nfemininity and health may not be due to disease resistance. It is possible that feminine\nwomen are more likely to avoid infection by moderating their exposure to pathogens rather\nthan possessing superior immune systems. It may be the case that the hormones associated\nwith facial masculinity (i.e., testosterone in men; Pound, Penton-Voak, and Surridge, 2009)\nand lower estrogen in women (Law Smith et al., 2006) are precisely those which predispose\nan individual to engage in behavior linked with the acquisition of disease/infection (e.g.,\nincreased risk taking/impulsivity). Indeed, men are more likely to engage in unhygienic\nbehavior than women, as studies of restroom hygiene have demonstrated (Johnson et al.,\n2003; White, Kolble, Carlson, and Lipson, 2005). Further study should therefore seek to\nassess the health attitudes of women and men with feminine and masculine faces before\nany strong claims can be made regarding the inherent immunity associated with feminine\nfaced females and masculine faced males.\nIn summary, this study supports the finding that facial femininity and attractiveness\nmay indicate women's health history, which partially supports (although without\nconfirmation of such relationships in future health, does not confirm) the hypothesis that\nfemale facial structure is a direct indicator of health functioning.\n"
