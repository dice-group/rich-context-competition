Evidence shows that both\nwomen and men are sexually active well into later life (e.g.,\nbecause sexual ability is closely related to health status that\ndeclines with age, considerable numbers of older adults\nhave concerns about their sexual functioning (e.g., Laumann,\nFindings from our previous study suggest that social rela-\ntionships can help older adults handle negative feelings\nabout their own sexual dysfunction in the relationship with\nspouse or partner (Hirayama & Walker, 2011). To maintain\npartnerships, however, it also is critical for older adults to\nmanage the situation in which their partner faces sexual\ndysfunction. In fact, it has been reported that older adults\nare struggling to adjust their intimate relationships to not\nonly their own but also their partner's sexual functioning\nOur aim in this study is to explore whether and how\nsocial relationships may protect the psychological well-being\nof older adults when their partner's sexual dysfunction\nmakes it difficult to have a sexual relationship. Although\nsocial relationships have been consistently shown to influ-\nence health and well-being in later life (e.g., Antonucci,\n(i.e., social network members, especially those to whom\none feels close) has been understudied in the literature on\nsexual health among older adults, where medical perspec-\ntives predominate. Linking social relationships research to\nthe field of sexual health in later life, our study will help\nclarify how older adults, with their social partners, can bet-\nter negotiate intimate ties when partners face aging-related\nsexual problems.\nSelf, Perceived Partner Responsiveness, and\nWell-being\nSymbolic interactionism posits that individuals develop a\nsense of the self through reflection of the views of others\n(Tice & Wallace, 2003). That is, we observe how others\nrespond to us and then incorporate those responses into our\nself-view (i.e., \"looking glass\" self; Cooley, 1902). The theory\npresumes that significant others, typically the spouse or\nintimate partner in adulthood, are most influential in the\nprocess of self-construal (Mead, 1934).Across the life span,\nindividuals rely most on significant others for affirmation of\ntheir ideas and behavior. By receiving such affirmation from\nothers, individuals internalize and reinforce the belief that\nthey are worthy and capable persons (Tice & Wallace, 2003).\nAligned with this perspective, researchers on social rela-\ntionships have theorized how and why perceiving others to\nbe supportive enhances individuals' psychological well-\nbeing (Lakey & Cohen, 2000). When individuals perceive\nthat their significant others would satisfy their needs will-\ningly, individuals develop a sense of self-worth and self-\nefficacy, which then helps them see their lives as manageable\nand thus protects their psychological well-being even in\nchallenging situations (Antonucci, 2001).\nWhen a Partner Has a Sexual Problem: Gendered\nImplications for Psychological Well-being in Later Life\nRyo Hirayama and Alexis J. Walker\nDepartment of Human Development and Family Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis.\nObjectives. Guided by symbolic interactionism, we examined (a) whether the psychological well-being of older adults\nmight be threatened if they feel bothered by an intimate partner's sexual unresponsiveness and (b) whether such sexual\nunresponsiveness of a partner might be compensated by perceived supportiveness of significant others. We explored these\nquestions separately by gender, anticipating that sexual unresponsiveness might affect men and women differently and\nthat support from a partner might be more important for men and support from others more important for women.\nMethod. Using data from 1,346 participants in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we conducted\nmultiple group regression analysis and estimated models separately but simultaneously for women and men.\nResults. Although feeling bothered by the sexual unresponsiveness of an intimate partner was significantly associated\nwith both women's and men's depressive symptoms, the moderating effect of the partner's supportiveness was significant\nonly for women.\nDiscussion. The results suggest that gender is a key dimension for understanding the relations among negative\nfeelings about sexual relationships, socioemotional support from significant others, and psychological well-being in\nolder age.\nKey Words: Gender--Sexual behavior--Social support.\nThis theoretical perspective suggests a link between the\nperceived sexual responsiveness of the intimate partner and\nolder adults' psychological well-being. When older adults\nperceive their partner to be reluctant or unable to satisfy\ntheir needs for sexual intimacy (i.e., sexually unresponsive),\ntheir view of the self as a sexual partner is likely to be\nthreatened. Because many adults consider sexual satisfac-\ntion as an important component of intimate partnerships\n(Sprecher & Cate, 2004), a wounded self-view in terms\nof sexual partnering can deteriorate their psychological\nwell-being.\nYet, older adults likely do not judge their partner's re-\nsponsiveness solely by whether the partner is perceived to\nsatisfy their needs for sexual intimacy willingly. Symbolic\ninteractionism suggests that the role of an intimate partner\ncomprises multiple meanings such as confidant and compan-\nion (LaRossa & Reitzes, 1993). For example, older adults\nmay perceive their partner to be responsive if the partner\nlistens to them willingly when they have a concern (i.e.,\nresponsive partner as a confidant). Furthermore, psychological\nwell-being is thought to be enhanced by an accumulation\nof multiple forms of perceived supportiveness (Antonucci,\n2001). Thus, the psychological well-being of older adults\ncan be secured when they perceive their partner to be\nunwilling or unable to satisfy their needs for sexual intimacy if\nthey perceive their partner to respond to them in a helpful\nmanner in other nonsexual aspects of intimate partnerships.\nIn addition, individuals can have multiple significant others\nas sources of socioemotional support including affirmation,\nalthough spouse or partner is likely to be the most preferred\nsupport provider in adulthood (e.g., Antonucci, 2001;\nTakahashi, 2005). Gerontological research has indicated that\nacquiring and maintaining various sources of socioemo-\ntional support is a key for aging well (Adams & Blieszner,\n1995). Because an accumulation of perceived support from\none's close relationships is thought to increase psychological\nwell-being (Antonucci), the sense that other social partners\n(e.g., relatives, friends) are responsive may have a protective\npsychological effect for older adults with a less sexually\nresponsive partner.\nHow perceived responsiveness influences such older\nadults may differ by gender. Extant literature shows that\nolder men's social networks are centered on spousal rela-\ntionships, whereas women have multiple equally close others\nin their networks (Antonucci, 2001). Thus, men's well-\nbeing may be governed more than women's by perceived\nresponsiveness of spouse or partner. Moreover, cultural\ndiscourses encourage men to perform well sexually even in\nolder age (Potts, Grace, Vares, & Gavey, 2006). As sug-\ngested by symbolic interactionism, individuals' views of\nthemselves as a sexual partner will be contingent on how\nmuch their partner is responsive sexually. Because of the\npressure on men to be continuously sexually competent,\ntheir well-being may be damaged more than women's when\ntheir partner is sexually disengaged. In summary, perceived\nresponsiveness of spouse or partner, both sexually and\nnonsexually, may influence men more than women. By\ncontrast, perceived responsiveness of other social partners,\nsuch as relatives and friends, may influence women's well-\nbeing to a similar extent as responsiveness of spouse or\npartner.\nResearch Aims\nOur primary aim is to identify whether perceived sexual\nunresponsiveness of an intimate partner can be compen-\nsated by nonsexual forms of responsiveness of multiple sig-\nnificant others. We hypothesize that (a) perceived sexual\nunresponsiveness of spouse or partner will have a negative\neffect on the psychological well-being of older adults and\n(b) this effect, however, may be moderated by other, non-\nsexual forms of perceived responsiveness (i.e., perceived\nsupport) by close social partners, including not only spouse\nor partner but also other family members and friends. We\nalso examine whether and how the effect of perceived\nresponsiveness may differ by gender.\nWe consider psychological well-being comprised both\npositive (e.g., happiness) and negative (e.g., symptoms)\nmental states that are related but independent (Karademas,\n2007). Research has shown that each is differentially asso-\nciated with health status and functioning (Huppert &\nWhittington, 2003). Our previous analysis also showed that\nthe effect of social relationships on the positive and negative\nwell-being of older adults facing sexual concerns is incon-\nsistent (Hirayama & Walker, 2011). Including both positive\nand negative psychological states is necessary to better\nunderstand the relation between perceived partner respon-\nsiveness and psychological well-being.\nThe related literature suggests the need to consider both\n(a) the sociodemographic background and (b) the health\nstatus of older adults when examining the psychological\neffects of sexual dysfunction. Research has indicated that\nattitudes toward sexual relationships vary by such dimen-\nsions as birth cohort, race, and social class (e.g., Burgess,\n2004). In addition, health has been shown to be associated\nwith both older adults' engagement in sexual activity\n(Lindau et al., 2007) and their psychological well-being\n(George, 2010). To clarify the relation of perceived sexual\nunresponsiveness of partner to the psychological well-being\nof older adults, we take into account their age, racial back-\nground, level of education received, and physical health.\nMethod\nWe analyzed data from the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-based survey\nrepresentative sample of 3,005 U.S. community-dwelling\nadults aged 57\u00ad85 years. Our analysis was restricted to a\nsubsample of 1,346 adults who (a) were married or had an\nintimate partner and (b) engaged in sexual activities with\ntheir spouse or partner in the last 12 months because only\nthese adults answered questions regarding whether their\npartner experienced sexual dysfunction. Because fewer than\n0.3% (n = 4) had a sexual relationship with more than one\npartner, we focused on the primary partner of each participant.\nIn addition, we excluded the four adults with a same-gender\npartner. Because of our secondary focus on gender differ-\nences in the association between perceived partner respon-\nsiveness and well-being, we estimated our model separately\nfor women and for men.\nOur subsample included more men (n = 844) than women\n(n = 502), and average age differed significantly by gender\npants were relatively highly educated (84.4% completed\nhigh school; 27.8% had graduated from college), but more\nlonger than men, older men, especially those of higher\nsocioeconomic status, are more likely than women to have\nan intimate partner in later life (Burgess, 2004). For this\nreason, our analytic sample reflects the gender and class\ncomposition of the population of partnered older adults.\nof men were White. Although we included both marital and\nnonmarital partnerships, married participants predominated\ndifference in racial background or partnerships.\nMeasurement\nPerceived sexual unresponsiveness of a partner.--As noted,\nguided by symbolic interactionism, we define perceived\nsexual unresponsiveness of a partner as older adults' per-\nception that their partner is reluctant or unable to satisfy\ntheir needs for sexual intimacy and that this is a bother-\nsome. Our focus, therefore, is not on the sexual dysfunction\nof partner per se. Relevant to the symbolic interaction\nframework is how older adults perceive and are bothered by\nthe sexual problems of their partner, especially their view of\nthe partner's problems as a hindrance to their pursuit of\nsexual intimacy. Because Reis, Clark, and Holmes (2004)\nsuggested that individuals experience negative feelings\nsuch as dissatisfaction when perceiving their social partner\nas not meeting their needs (i.e., partner unresponsiveness),\nas an index of feeling bothered by the perceived sexual un-\nresponsiveness of a partner, we assessed how much partici-\npants were troubled by the sexual inability and disinterest of\ntheir spouse or partner.\nNSHAP participants who engaged in sexual activities\nwith their spouse or partner in the last 12 months reported\nwhether the spouse or partner had any of the following\nproblems with sexual functioning: lack of interest in\nsex, being unable to climax, climaxing too quickly, not find-\ning sex pleasurable, anxiety about the ability for sexual\nperformance, erectile dysfunction (for a male partner), and\nproblems with lubrication (for a female partner). These\nitems were originally developed for another project, Nat\nional Health and Social Life Survey, and cover the major\nproblems in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-\ntal Disorder (4th ed.) classification of sexual dysfunction\n(Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999). Participants then answered\nhow much they felt bothered by each problem their partner\nhad using a 3-point scale that ranged from 0 = not at all to\n2 = a lot. Half of the participants (n = 674) reported that\ntheir spouse or partner faced at least one sexual problem.\nWhen participants refused to answer or did not know\nwhether their partner had a given sexual problem, we\ncounted their partner as not having the problem, and thus,\nthese participants were treated as not feeling bothered by\nthe problem (for the reason specified below).\nBecause participants reported how much they felt both-\nered only regarding problems their partner faced, it was not\npossible to simply sum scores across problems each partici-\npant reported. (The possible range of such a summary index\nwould differ among participants according to the number of\npartner's sexual problems.) To create an index with a con-\nsistent range across participants, we averaged the ratings of\nhow bothersome each of the partner's sexual problems was\nto the participant (range = 0\u00ad2).\nThis individually adjusted index captures how much\nrespondents feel troubled by their partner's sexual problems\nregardless of the number and types of partner's problems. In\nother words, this index did not assume (a) the number of\nperceived sexual problems of the partner is related to the\nlevel of feeling bothered or (b) a given type of sexual prob-\nlem of the partner is necessarily more influential in partici-\npants' feelings than other types of problems are. We rejected\nthese assumptions for the following reasons. First, results of\nour subsidiary analysis indicated that greater numbers of\npartner's sexual problems do not necessarily increase re-\nports of how bothersome the problems are to the participant.\nSpecifically, we found that, among respondents whose part-\nner faced more than one sexual problem, there was no sig-\nnificant difference in scores on our individually adjusted\nindex (i.e., average rating of how bothered) by the number\nof partner's sexual problems.\nSecond, our subsidiary analyses also indicated consider-\nable individual differences in which problems troubled par-\nticipants and to what extent. Simply combining scores of\nfeeling bothered across problems, we examined whether the\npartner's having a given problem made a difference in\nscores on this combined measure. We found that some types\nof problems, such as partner's inability to climax, were not\nsignificantly associated with this combined measure. One\nmight assume, then, that these types of sexual problems\nwould not lead to perceived sexual unresponsiveness of\npartner. Yet, almost half (45%) of women whose partner\nwas unable to climax reported that they felt bothered some-\nwhat or a lot by this problem. Thus, some types of partner's\nsexual problems are less influential in the partnership on\naverage but could have a critical influence on a small number\nof couples. Accordingly, we consider our individually ad-\njusted index to be an adequate measure for feeling bothered\nby the perceived sexual unresponsiveness of the partner.\nPerceived support from significant others.--For each of\nthe three types of relationships, the relationship with spouse\nor partner, family, and friends, NSHAP participants were\nasked about perceived availability of two types of support:\nHow often they can open up if they need to talk about their\nworries and how often they can ask for help if they have\na problem. The participants answered each item using a\n3-point scale ranging from 0 = hardly ever or never to 2 =\noften. We combined the scores on these two items to create\na measure of perceived support from each type of relation-\nship. Correlations of the two items for partnerships, family,\ntively (all p < .01). Each combined measure ranged from 0\nto 4. We scored having no family or having no friend as\nperceiving support as hardly ever or never available. At the\nsame time, to take account of the possible different influ-\nences of objective and subjective social isolation (Cornwell &\nWaite, 2009), we included dummy variables that indicate\nwhether participants were without family (n = 4) or without\nfriends (n = 41). (These two dummy variables had no sig-\nnificant effect in all models and are not shown in the tables\nthat summarize results.)\nPsychological well-being.--An item about general hap-\npiness \"If you were to consider your life in general these\ndays, how happy or unhappy would you say you are on the\nwhole?\" served as our measure of positive psychological\nwell-being. Participants answered this item using a 5-point\nscale ranging from 0 = usually unhappy to 4 = extremely\nhappy. General happiness has been shown to be highly cor-\nrelated with other constructs of positive well-being such as\nlife satisfaction (Slocum-Gori, Zumbo, Michalos, & Diener,\n2009). Furthermore, this single-item measure of happiness\nhas advantages over other multi-item scales of positive\nwell-being, particularly given that few researchers reported\nthe internal consistency of such psychometric measures\nWe assessed negative well-being with the short version of\nthe Center for Epidemiological Studies\u00adDepression scale\n(CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Because the CES-D has been com-\nmonly used to assess the influence of social relationships\non the well-being of older adults (e.g., Fiori, Antonucci, &\nCortina, 2006), using this scale enhanced our study's com-\nparability with the existing literature. NSHAP participants\nindicated how often they had each of 11 kinds of thoughts\n(e.g., \"I felt everything I did was an effort\") in the previous\nweek using a scale ranging from 0 = rarely or none of the\ntime to 3 = most of the time. We used the total score on these\nControls.--We controlled for five variables: participants'\nage, level of education, racial background, and physical\nhealth. Education levels were included as an ordered vari-\nable consisting of four categories: 0 = less than high school,\n1 = high school, 2 = some college, and 3 = bachelor's or\nmore. Race was classified into four categories (White,\nBlack, Non-Black Hispanic, and Other) with White as the\nreference category in the analysis. Physical health was\nincluded using participants' self-rated health, ranging from\n0 = very poor to 4 = excellent. Despite its simplicity and\nsubjectivity, self-rated health has been shown to be a\npowerful predictor of morbidity and mortality (Burstr\u00f6m &\nWe initially considered but did not include (a) the health\nstatus of the partner as perceived by participants and (b)\nparticipants' beliefs about sexual functioning and activities\nsuch as how much they view sexual dysfunction to be typi-\ncal in the aging process and how important they think sexual\nactivities are to maintaining partnerships. We anticipated\nthat these variables might influence participants' perception\nof the sexual problems of their partner. For example, we\nexpected that older adults might accept their partner's\nsexual problems if they perceive their partner to be in poor\nhealth and/or if they consider sexual dysfunction to be typi-\ncal in the aging process. We also expected that, if older\nadults believe sexual relationships to be necessary to main-\ntain partnerships, perceived sexual unresponsiveness of\npartner might likely threaten the psychological well-being\nof participants. Yet, our expectations were not supported.\nSpecifically, the association between perceived sexual unre-\nsponsiveness of partner and psychological well-being did\nnot differ by perceived health status of partner or by beliefs\nabout sexual functioning and activities (i.e., the interaction\nbetween sexual unresponsiveness and each of these vari-\nables was not significantly associated with psychological\nwell-being; results available upon request). Furthermore,\nwhether or not we included these variables in our models,\nthere was no change in the results regarding the relation\namong perceived sexual unresponsiveness of partner,\nperceived supportiveness of significant others, and psycho-\nlogical well-being. Thus, in the final analyses, we did not\ninclude perceived health status of partner or participants'\nbelief about sexual functioning and activities.\nAnalytic Strategy\nTo handle missing data, we first conducted multiple\nimputation using the ice program in Stata (Royston, 2005).\nThere were no missing data on the sociodemographic vari-\nables we used. The number of participants with missing\ndata was fewer than 20 for our independent and dependent\nvariables (e.g., perceived supportiveness, general happiness,\ndepressive symptoms) except for perceived sexual unre-\nsponsiveness of partner. To infer missing data on a variable,\nwe relied on nonmissing responses for the other variables\nthat were included in the analytic models (Allison, 2002).\nBy doing so, we generated five imputed data sets from\nwhich to compute pooled estimates for our results (Acock,\n2005). We concluded that our results are robust to imputa-\ntion by comparing our findings to the results using listwise\ndeletion. Specifically, whether we used multiple imputation\nor listwise deletion made little difference in the direction or\nmagnitude of regression coefficients in our analytic models;\nonly a few coefficients for the control variables failed to\nreach significance when excluding incomplete cases.\nWe did not impute missing responses on whether the\npartner had a sexual problem. Doing so would also require\nus to infer how much participants were bothered by the\nproblem. When participants did not report whether their\npartner had a sexual problem (i.e., don't know or refused to\nanswer), we treated them as not being bothered by the prob-\nlem. Our focus is not on partner's sexual problems per se\n(i.e., whether partner face sexual problems) but on partici-\npants' perception of partner's problems (i.e., how much\nthey are troubled by their partner's sexual problems). When\nparticipants don't know whether their partner faces a sexual\nproblem, it seems reasonable to assume that they do not feel\ntroubled by this problem. Such an assumption might be\nproblematic for participants who refused to answer, but\nfewer than 5% of participants did so for each item regarding\nsexual problems. Furthermore, excluding those who refused\nto answer changed only the significance of the coefficients\nof independent variables, with little change in their magni-\ntude or direction. Thus, we concluded that counting partici-\npants who don't know and refused to answer whether the\npartner has a sexual problem as not feeling bothered by the\nproblem has little impact on the overall results.\nBecause gender is a key dimension of our study, it is\nimportant to note a gender difference in missing responses\non partner's sexual problems. We found no gender differ-\nence in the number of respondents who refused to answer\nitems about any sexual problem of partner. For two types of\nclimaxing problems, however, more men than women didn't\nknow whether their partner experienced these problems: 96\n(3.8%) women didn't know whether their partner climaxed\ntoo quickly. This gender difference suggests that men may\nbe less sensitive than women to partner's climaxing prob-\nlems, and thus, \"freer\" from perceived sexual unresponsive-\nness of partner if their partner experiences only these types\nof problems.\nAfter creating the imputed data sets, we conducted multiple\ngroup hierarchical regression analyses in which the model\nwas estimated separately but simultaneously for women and\nfor men. Each of the two types of psychological well-being,\ngeneral happiness and depressive symptoms, were regressed\nseparately on the same sets of independent variables. The\nfirst block of independent variables involved feeling both-\nered by the perceived sexual unresponsiveness of a partner,\nperceived support from close social partners, and controls.\nThis block was primarily intended to examine the associa-\ntion between bothersome perceived sexual unresponsive-\nness of the partner and psychological well-being. Then, we\nadded the second block that consisted of three interaction\nterms combining bothersome perceived sexual unrespon-\nsiveness of the partner with perceived support from each\nof the three types of close relationships (i.e., partnerships,\nfamily, and friend relationships). These interactions were\nincluded to identify whether perceived support from signifi-\ncant others could moderate the influence of bothersome\nsexual unresponsiveness of the partner on well-being.\nWe used chi-square difference tests to examine (a) whether\nthe effects of bothersome perceived responsiveness might\ndiffer for women and for men and (b) whether the effects of\nbothersome perceived responsiveness might differ by type\nof relationship. We ran the models in which coefficients\nwere constrained to be equal and then compared the con-\nstrained model with the original one in which coefficients\nwere freely estimated. If the model chi-square statistic for\nthe constrained model was significantly larger than that for\nthe unconstrained model, we would conclude that the\neffects were different (a) between women and men and (b)\nacross relationship types.\nResults\nGender Differences in Independent and Dependent\nVariables\nTable 1 summarizes descriptive statistics of our variables\nof interest except those for sociodemographic background.\nThere was no significant gender difference in variables\nrelated to spouse or partner. Among both women and men,\nfeeling bothered by partner's sexual problems was low\nbecause half of the participants reported that their intimate\npartner experienced no sexual dysfunction. Both women\nand men perceived their intimate partner to be relatively\nhighly supportive. Perceived support from other relation-\nships differed by gender: Women perceived both their\nfamily and friends to be more supportive than men. Regarding\npsychological well-being, there was no significant gender\ndifference in general happiness, whereas depressive symp-\ntoms were higher among women than among men. There\nwas no significant gender difference in perceived self-rated\nhealth status.\nEffects of Perceived Sexual Unresponsiveness and Support\non Positive Well-being\nTable 2 presents the results of multiple group hierarchical\nregression analysis for general happiness. Feeling bothered\nby partner's sexual problems did not have a significant\neffect on either men's or women's general happiness. In\naddition, no interaction term was significant; thus, the effect\nof feeling bothered by partner's sexual problems on general\nhappiness was not moderated by perceived support from\nany relationship.\nWe also examined whether the effects of perceived sup-\nport might differ across relationship types. Our major focus\nwas on the moderating effects of perceived support, which\ndid not reach significance for either women or men. Never-\ntheless, we also analyzed whether its direct effects on\nwell-being differed across relationship types to test our\nhypotheses about gender differences; that is, whether men\nare more likely than women to prioritize their intimate part-\nner over other close relationships.\nResults of the chi-square difference tests showed that\nwhich relationship type influenced well-being differed by\ngender (results not shown in Table 2). The direct effect of\nperceived support from friends was significant only for\nwomen, and its magnitude differed significantly between\nand men, the magnitude of the direct effect of perceived\nTable 1.

A chi-square difference\ntest showed no gender difference in the magnitude of this\nassociation. For women, however, perceived support from\nintimate partner moderated this association significantly,\nalthough the gender difference in the magnitude of this\nmoderating effect did not reach significance. The coefficient\nof this moderating effect (B = -1.05) indicates that depres-\nsive symptoms are lower among women whose spouse or\npartner is perceived to be more supportive, when this spouse\nor partner is also perceived to be sexually unresponsive.\nChi-square difference tests indicated that the moderating\neffects of perceived support did not differ across relation-\nship types for either women or men (results not shown in\nTable 3). The results for direct effects, however, indicated\ngender differences by relationship types. For men, only\nintimate partner's supportiveness was significant, and its\nmagnitude was significantly larger than both that of family's\nFor women, however, both intimate partner's and family's\nsupportiveness had a significant negative effect on depres-\nsive symptoms.

Furthermore, the association between feel-\ning bothered by partner's sexual problems and depression\ndid not differ by gender. Thus, both women and men are\nlikely to experience a negative psychological state when\ntheir partner's sexual dysfunction makes it difficult to have\na sexual relationship.\nThe results suggest that, at least for women, being both-\nered by an intimate partner's sexual unresponsiveness can\nbe compensated by perceived supportiveness of this partner.\nThis moderating effect was significant for women's depres-\nsive symptoms, the only well-being variable significantly\nassociated with bothersome perceived sexual unresponsive-\nness. By contrast, no moderating effect was significant for\nmen. Because chi-square difference tests showed no gender\ndifference in the magnitude of moderating effects, we\ncannot conclude that women's psychological well-being is\nmore protected than men's by perceived support from their\nintimate partner. Yet, men may face more difficulty than\nwomen when perceiving their intimate partner to be sexu-\nally unresponsive because no close relationship moderated\nthe significant association between perceived sexual unre-\nsponsiveness of partner and negative well-being.\nBecause neither family's nor friends' support had a sig-\nnificant moderating effect, it appears that sexual unrespon-\nsiveness of intimate partner cannot be compensated by\nsupportiveness in close relationships other than partner-\nships. This result is in contrast with our previous findings on\nthe influences of multiple significant others on perceptions\nof one's own sexual dysfunction (Hirayama & Walker,\n2011). In the previous study, we found that confidant friend-\nships as well as partnerships moderate the association\nbetween feeling bothered by one's own sexual problems\nand psychological well-being (Hirayama & Walker, 2011).\nThe results of the present study for women, however, suggest\nthat feeling bothered by one's partner's sexual problems\ncan be resolved only within partnerships: Whether women\ncan manage the sexual unresponsiveness of their intimate\npartner depends on whether this partner responds in a help-\nful manner in nonsexual aspects of the relationship.\nAt the same time, gender differences in the direct effects\nof multiple significant others suggest that other close rela-\ntionships, such as those with family and friends, may influence\nwhether older adults can manage the sexual unresponsive-\nness of their intimate partner through perceived support\nfrom this partner. First, chi-square difference tests indicated\nno gender difference in the magnitude of the direct effect of\nsexual unresponsiveness of the spouse or partner or in the\nmagnitude of the direct effect of perceived support from the\nspouse or partner on psychological well-being. Therefore,\nthe psychological impact of feeling bothered by the per-\nceived sexual unresponsiveness and supportiveness of an\nintimate partner does not seem to differ by gender. In our\nresults, gender differences emerged in the direct effects of\nfamily's and friends' supportiveness in comparison with\nthat of an intimate partner's. For women, friends' support-\niveness was associated with negative well-being in a similar\nway to that of the intimate partner. By contrast, among men,\nthe direct effect of a partner's supportiveness on well-being\nwas greater than that of other relationships. Gerontological\nresearch on social relationships has indicated that various\ntypes of close relationships are needed to better cope with\nproblems individuals face in the process of aging (Adams &\nBlieszner, 1995). Indeed, compared with older adults with\nboth active family and nonfamily ties, older adults who\nengage with their spouse and children without socializing\nwith nonfamily members are at greater risk of mental health\nproblems (Fiori et al., 2006). It is thus suggested that spousal\nrelationships have a protective psychological effect on well-\nbeing only when one has a close relationship with other\nsocial partners. Diverse close social ties may be needed for\nolder adults to manage the sexual unresponsiveness of an\nintimate partner through perceived support from this partner.\nIn other words, men's exclusive reliance on their intimate\npartner may make it difficult for them to manage negative\nfeelings about the partner's sexual dysfunction, even when\ntheir partner is supportive.\nOverall, gender is a key dimension to explore how older\nadults, with their social partners, can negotiate intimate\npartnerships in facing sexual problems. In our previous\nstudy (Hirayama & Walker, 2011), we found that confidant\npartnerships can help men, but not women, handle negative\nfeelings about their own sexual dysfunction. In contrast, the\npresent analysis suggests that supportive partnerships pro-\ntect women's, but not men's, well-being when feeling both-\nered by the partner's sexual dysfunction.Which relationship\nis effective for whose sexual problems seems to differ by\ngender. This complex gendered association among sexual\ndysfunction, social relationships, and well-being should be\nconsidered for researchers and health practitioners to better\nhelp older adults with sexual problems. In addition, the\nresults also point to the need to study both positive and\nnegative aspects of well-being. Because the sexual unre-\nsponsiveness of one's intimate partner had a significant\neffect only on depressive symptoms, examining only either\npositive or negative mental state could lead one to an inap-\npropriate conclusion on the influences of sexual health\nproblems on psychological well-being.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nWe acknowledge several limitations of our analysis. First,\nwe could not clarify how perceived sexual unresponsive-\nness of one's intimate partner influences the psychological\nwell-being of older adults. Despite some support from the\nresults especially regarding gender differences, the process\nwe hypothesized from symbolic interactionism remains\nspeculative because NSHAP data do not include an ade-\nquate item for our hypothetical mediator, namely, self-view\nin terms of sexual partnering. The process linking the sexual\nunresponsiveness of one's intimate partner to psychological\nwell-being (e.g., what mediates the association between the\ntwo) needs to be clarified. Because we could not find an\neffective moderator of the association between partner's\nsexual unresponsiveness and the well-being of men, such\ncloser examination of the process may be particularly im-\nportant to identify how to block the negative psychological\ninfluence of feeling bothered by their partner's sexual dys-\nfunction for men.\nSecond, because of the cross-sectional nature of our data,\nwe could not identify the causal direction between feelings\nof being bothered by the perceived sexual unresponsiveness\nof intimate partner and psychological well-being. Note that\nour focus was perceived partner's responsiveness. Thus, the\nsignificant association between sexual unresponsiveness\nand negative well-being may mean that depressed older\nadults perceive their partner to be sexually unresponsive. In\nfact, research has indicated that depressed people seek more\npositive feedback from close relationships than do nonde-\npressed people (Joiner & Timmons, 2009). Therefore,\ndepressed older adults may tend to perceive their partner's\nbehavior as unresponsive when, without such mental health\nproblems, the same behavior could be seen as responsive.\nThird, our analytic sample was restricted to older adults\nwho engaged in sexual activities with their spouse or part-\nner in the last 12 months because only they reported whether\ntheir partner experienced sexual dysfunction. Thus, we may\nhave excluded older adults whose partner had such severe\nsexual dysfunction that they could not engage in sexual\nactivity. In other words, our results may not be applicable\nto older couples facing serious or long-term sexual health\nproblems.\nFourth, we examined only limited forms of supportiveness\nof significant others because few such items were available\nin the data set. There should be many other forms of respon-\nsiveness older adults may expect from their social partners.\nExamining few types of perceived supportiveness might\nexplain why we found no significant moderating effect of\nsignificant others for men. The literature on close relationships\nsuggests that women and men find closeness and intimacy\nin different types of social interactions (Wood, 2000). For\nexample, studies have shown that men are more likely than\nwomen to associate close friendships with sharing activities\ntheir social partners to be responsive if these partners share\nthe same interests rather than provide such socioemotional\nsupport as we included in the analysis. In summary, consid-\nering diverse forms of perceived responsiveness could draw\na different, more precise picture of the association among\nthe sexual unresponsiveness of an intimate partner, perceived\nsupport from multiple significant others, and psychological\nwell-being, especially in relation to gender.\nFinally, we urge caution in comparing the results for positive\nversus negative well-being because of the measurement\nimbalance between these two. Whereas our measure of\nnegative well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms) comprised\nmultiple items, positive well-being (i.e., general happiness)\nwas assessed with a single item. Furthermore, because pos-\nsible variability in positive well-being was limited among\nrespondents, fewer independent variables were significant\nfor positive than for negative well-being. For example, feelings\nof being bothered by the perceived sexual unresponsiveness\nof partner were associated only with negative well-being.\nTo clarify whether and how sexual relationships are associ-\nated differently with positive and with negative well-being,\nit would be necessary to assess both types of well-being\nwith comparable measures.\nDespite these limitations, the results suggest that social\ngerontology has the potential to make a significant contribu-\ntion to the growing field of sexual health among older adults.\nAlthough the role of medical treatment has received much\nattention in this field, our findings are consistent with previ-\nous research on the health- and well-being\u00adrelated effects\nof close relationships for older women and men. Existing\nliterature on social relationships will likely help us to iden-\ntify how older adults, with the support from their social\npartners, can better manage aging-related sexual problems.\nGiven the association between sexual relationships and\nwell-being in older age, such investigation should help indi-\nviduals to have a higher quality of later life despite declines\nin sexual functioning.\n"
