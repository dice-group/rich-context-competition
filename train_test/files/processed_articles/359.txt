Preserved -cell function was defined on the basis of cut points\nderived from the   Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (fasting C-peptide 0.23\nng/ml) and from the U.S. adolescent population of the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) 5th percentile for fasting C-peptide (1.0 ng/ml). We compared the\nclinical characteristics between those with and without preserved -cell function.\nRESULTS -- Within the first year of diagnosis, 82.9% of youth had a fasting C-peptide 0.23\nng/ml and 31.2% had values 1.0 ng/ml. Among those with 5 years of diabetes duration,\n10.7% had preserved -cell function based on the DCCT cutoff and 1.0% were above the 5th\npercentile of the NHANES population.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Within the 1st year of diagnosis, four of five youth with autoantibody-\npositive diabetes have clinically significant amounts of residual -cell function and about one-\nthird have fasting C-peptide levels above the 5th percentile of a healthy adolescent population.\nEven 5 years after diagnosis, 1 of 10 has fasting C-peptide above a clinically significant threshold.\nThese findings have implications for clinical classification of youth with diabetes as well as\nclinical trials aimed to preserve -cell function after diabetes onset.\nImmune-mediated -cell destruction,\nmarked by the presence of diabetes au-\ntoantibodies, occurs before and contin-\nues after the clinical diagnosis of type 1\ndiabetes. This model has served as the\nfoundation of pathophysiological studies\nof the disease process and clinical studies\ndesigned to identify future risk for diabetes\nand to modify clinical course. The resultant\nperception is that most individuals with\ntype 1 diabetes will have complete destruc-\ntion of -cells within a few years after diag-\nnosis without a targeted intervention to\nsustain -cell function.\nDespite frequent use of this model in\nresearch and patient care, it represents\nonly part of the picture. Data from place-\nbo-controlled populations in clinical inter-\nvention trials suggest that some individuals\nwith type 1 diabetes will have persistent\n-cell function years after diagnosis (1,2).\nThe screening phase of the   Con-\ntrol and Complications Trial (DCCT)\ndemonstrated that 48% of adults had sig-\nnificant C-peptide levels within 5 years of\ndiagnosis, and 8% had significant C-\nAnother study reported similar findings\nin 15% of individuals with measurable C-\npeptide levels 8\u00ad15 years after diagnosis\n(4). Multiple studies have reported that\nthe loss of -cell function after diagnosis\nis related to age of onset as well as to fac-\ntors linked to autoimmunity such as au-\ntoantibodies (5\u00ad11). Nonetheless, there is\na common belief that persistence of -cell\nfunction is rare in young children with\ntype 1 diabetes.\nThe SEARCH for   in Youth\n(SEARCH) study, designed to determine\nthe prevalence, incidence, and character-\nistics of diabetes in U.S. youth, provides\nan opportunity to examine the frequency\nof residual -cell function in a popula-\ntion-based sample of GAD65 or IA2\nyouth with diabetes.\nMETHODS -- Data for this analysis\nderive from the SEARCH study as de-\nscribed previously (12). SEARCH is a\npopulation-based study conducted at six\ncentersintheU.S.,includingexisting(prev-\nalent) and newly diagnosed (incident) cases\nof diabetes in youth aged 20 years. Partic-\nipants were asked to complete an initial sur-\nvey and then were invited to an in-person\nstudy visit. After informed consent was pro-\nvided, a brief examination was performed\nand blood samples were obtained.\nStudy population\n                                                \nFrom the 1  Research Program, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, Washington; the 2Wake Forest\nUniversity School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the 3Cincinnati Children's Hospital and\nMedical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio; the 4Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina and the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of\nSouth Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina; the 5Department of Epidemiology, Colorado School of Public\nHealth, University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado; the 6Division of   Translation, National Center\nfor Chronic Disease Prevention and the Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nAtlanta, Georgia; the 7Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; and the\n8Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.\nCorresponding author: Carla Greenbaum, cjgreen@benaroyaresearch.org.\n*A complete list of the SEARCH for   in Youth (SEARCH) Study Group can be found in the APPENDIX.\nThe contents of this article are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the\nofficial views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of   and\nDigestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\u00a9 2009 by the American   Association.

Post hoc analysis of DCCT data\ndemonstrated that those with preserved\nC-peptide, defined as stimulated C-\npeptide, value 0.6 ng/ml, had superior\nclinical outcomes, including less hypo-\nglycemia and retinopathy, than those\nwith lower C-peptide (13). Re-analysis of\nthese data indicated that the correspond-\ning fasting C-peptide was 0.23 ng/ml (J.\nLachin, P.F. McGee, personal communi-\ncation). Fasting C-peptide values 0.23\nng/ml are therefore considered clinically\nsignificant.\nHealthy adolescents. The 5th and 50th\npercentiles of fasting C-peptide in healthy\nticipated in the National Health and Nu-\nStatistics\nSAS for Windows (version 9.1; SAS Insti-\ntute, Cary, NC) was used for analysis. 2\nor t tests were used to evaluate relation-\nships between preserved -cell function\nstatus and characteristics of interest. Two\nsets of regression models were run. The\nfirst included logistic regression models\nexamining associations between variables\nof interest and preserved -cell function\nstatus, stratified by duration of diabetes\nparticipants with preserved C-peptide\nlevels based on the DCCT cutoff, multiple\nlinear regression models were used to\nidentify variables significantly associated\nwith fasting C-peptide levels. All logistic\nand linear regression models included the\nfollowing covariates: age at diagnosis, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, BMI Z score at time of the\nvisit, A1C, number of autoantibodies\npresent, fasting plasma glucose, and HLA\ngenotype. In addition, linear models were\nadjusted for duration of disease.\nRESULTS -- The average age at diag-\nthe individuals diabetes was diagnosed\nwhen they were 5 years of age, 38%\n15 and 19 years of age at diagnosis. Aver-\nage duration of diabetes was 3 years, with\nduration of years.\nAmong individuals with duration of\nfasting C-peptide at or above the 5th per-\ncentile of the NHANES population and\n7.2% had fasting C-peptide at or above\nthe NHANES 50th percentile level. As ex-\npected, the proportion of individuals with\npreserved C-peptide diminished with in-\ncreasing disease duration. This finding is\nillustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the pro-\nportion with preserved C-peptide in\nquarterly intervals from time from diag-\nnosis. Among those with duration of 5\nyears, 10.7% had preserved C-peptide at\nthe DCCT cut point, 1.0% at NHANES\npercentile.\nWe then explored various character-\nistics of participants with and without\npreserved fasting C-peptide (Table 1). In\nthe unadjusted analysis, the proportion of\nnon-Hispanic whites who had preserved\nfasting C-peptide was smaller than that of\nother race/ethnicities. More individuals\nwith preserved C-peptide had two anti-\nbodies and a significantly higher percent-\nage of HLA DR15. In addition, those with\npreserved fasting C-peptide were older at\ndiagnosis, had a shorter duration of dia-\nbetes, and had a lower A1C at the time of\nthe study visit. Those with C-peptide\nabove the NHANES 5th percentile also\nhad a higher BMI Z score than those with\nC-peptide below this level.\nFigure 2 presents the results of the mul-\ntiple logistic regression models with the di-\nchotomous outcome of preserved fasting\nC-peptide status based on the DCCT defi-\nnition stratified by diabetes duration. Vari-\nables found to be independently associated\nwith preserved -cell function in all the\nmodels included older age at diagnosis and\nlower A1C at time of study visit. Race/\nethnicity other than non-Hispanic white\nwas also significant for those participants\nwith diabetes duration of 1\u00ad2 years and 2\nyears; higher current BMI Z score was also\nsignificant only for those participants with\nduration of 1\u00ad2 years (Fig. 2).\nAmong those with preserved fasting\nC-peptide (DCCT definition), older age at\ndiagnosis, higher current BMI Z score,\nrace/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic\nwhite, female sex, lower A1C, and shorter\nduration of diabetes were independently\nrelated to higher fasting C-peptide levels.\nThe association of age at diagnosis and\ndiabetes duration with fasting C-peptide\nis illustrated in Fig. 3, demonstrating that\nlower fasting C-peptide is seen in partici-\npants with diagnosis of diabetes at a\nyounger age and those with longer dura-\ntion of disease. The relationship between\nweight categories at the time of the study\nvisit and prevalence of preserved -cell\nfunction at various times from diagnosis is\nshown in Fig. 4.

Cells with less than five\nsubjects are not reported.\n-Cell function in youth with ab diabetes\nyouth have preserved -cell function\neven 5 years after diagnosis.\nDespite evidence to the contrary, the\nbelief persists that youth with type 1 dia-\nbetes have little insulin secretion at diag-\nnosis and that insulin secretion rapidly\ndisappears after diagnosis. Classification\nschemes define type 1 diabetes as a state\nof absolute insulin deficiency and type 2\ndiabetes as a state of insulin resistance\ncombined with inadequate insulin secre-\ntion (15). Thus, health care providers\nhave used C-peptide measurements clin-\nically to establish type of diabetes and to\nselect therapies. Although this analysis\ndoes not address the question of whether\nthere is a C-peptide cut point value that\ncould distinguish different types of diabe-\ntes, the data demonstrate that many youth\nwith antibody-positive diabetes have C-\npeptide levels within the range of those of\nthe normal population. Specifically,\nwithin 1 year of diagnosis, almost one-\nthird of subjects had C-peptide values\nthat exceeded the 5th percentile and 1\nfor healthy adolescents.\nnot all (21), documented that even a small\namount of residual -cell function is of\nclinical significance. Using a level of C-\npeptide associated with clinical signifi-\ncance in the DCCT, we found that 82.9%\nof participants with diabetes duration of\n1 year exceed this threshold. The fre-\nquency of clinically significant -cell\nfunction is lower among youth with\nlonger duration of disease (53.3% for du-\nyears). Because the DCCT cut point has\nbeen suggested as an end point for clinical\ntrials designed to preserve -cell func-\ntion, we suggest caution in interpreting\ndata from nonrandomized trials or short-\nterm pilot studies because our data show\nthat endogenous C-peptide is present\nyears after diagnosis in a substantial por-\ntion of children.\nThe data in the present study are sim-\nilar to those reported by the DCCT, in\n5 years from diagnosis had residual\n-cell function. Because the DCCT popu-\nlation only included individuals aged\n13 years, many pediatricians felt that\npreservation of C-peptide was unlikely in\nyounger children. Among SEARCH par-\nticipants, we found a profound impact\nof advancing age at diagnosis on preser-\nvation of C-peptide production. The as-\nsociation was linear throughout the\ncomplete range of age of diagnosis (from 1\nto 20 years), suggesting that insulin resis-\ntance associated with puberty does not ac-\ncount for this finding. Others have\ndemonstrated an effect of age on C-\npeptide in individuals at risk for type 1\nSeveral reasons have been suggested\nfor preserved -cell function. First, in-\ncreased awareness of the symptoms of\ntype 1 diabetes and improved screening\nand diagnostic tools may have resulted in\ndiagnosis at an earlier point in the auto-\nimmune destruction of the -cells. Thus,\nthe individuals may have more -cell re-\nserve at diagnosis. Second, aggressive\ntreatment at diagnosis, with rapid and\ntight control of hyperglycemia, may result\nin improved -cell function (23). Third,\nincreased insulin resistance associated\nwith the epidemic of obesity may have\ncreated a greater strain on the declining\n-cell function resulting in diagnosis at a\ntime when the individuals have more\n-cell function than individuals in the\npast (24). Consistent with this concept,\namong those with preserved -cell func-\ntion, BMI Z score was an important vari-\nable in determining the fasting C-peptide\nlevel. However, the impact of BMI on\nwhether or not C-peptide was preserved\nwas less clear. As evident in Fig. 4, even\nmany years from diagnosis, about 10% of\nnormal-weight individuals had preserved\nfunction, suggesting that other, as yet, un-\ncharacterized factors contribute to heter-\nogeneity in disease progression.\nThis study also emphasizes the rela-\ntionship between A1C and C-peptide but\nprovides no insight as to whether better\nglucose control results in preserved func-\ntion or whether preserved function allows\nfor better A1C. Prospectively conducted\ntrials with clinical data such as insulin\nuse, carbohydrate consumption, and ex-\nercise may be helpful to address this\nquestion.\nThis article documents the frequency\nof preserved -cell function in a popula-\ntion-based racially/ethnically diverse co-\nhort of antibody-positive youth with\ndiabetes. Although the fasting C-peptide\nconcentration in antibody-positive youth\nwith diabetes is often below normal, these\ndata suggest that clinically significant\namounts may persist in some individuals\nfor some time even among subjects with\nmore than one autoantibody. Further-\nmore, these data indicate that there is a\nmarked relationship between age at diag-\nnosis, race/ethnicity, and residual C-\npeptide. Differences in pathophysiology\nbetween non-Hispanic white youth and\nyouth of other races/ethnicities may be\npresent. Incorporating age and race/\nethnicity into assessments of residual\n-cell function may provide a better pic-\nture of the natural history of disease both\nbefore and after diagnosis and a more ac-\ncurate assessment of the effectiveness of\ninterventions designed to prevent -cell\ndestruction.\n"
