For each initial ED visit, coders record one principal diagnosis (usually the most\nsevere) and one primary part of the body affected.\nResults: Based on 22 560 cases, an estimated 1.64 million older adults were treated in EDs for\nunintentional fall injuries. Of these, approximately 1.16 million, or 70.5%, were women. Fractures,\ncontusions/abrasions, and lacerations accounted for more than three quarters of all injuries. Rates for\ninjury diagnoses were generally higher among women, most notably for fractures which were 2.2 times\nhigher than for men. For all parts of the body, women's injury rates exceeded those of men. Rate ratios\nwere greatest for injuries of the leg/foot (2.3), arm/hand (2.0), and lower trunk (2.0). The hospitalization\nrate for women was 1.8 times that for men.\nConclusions: Among older adults, non-fatal fall related injuries disproportionately affected women. Much\nis known about effective fall prevention strategies. We need to refine, promote, and implement these\ninterventions. Additional research is needed to tailor interventions for different populations and to\ndetermine gender differences in the underlying causes and/or circumstances of falls. This information is\nvital for developing and implementing targeted fall prevention strategies.\nFall related injuries among adults age 65 years and older\nare a major health concern. Statistics on fatal falls have\nbeen readily available since 1968 through the National\nCenter for Health Statistics death certificate data. However,\nnational statistics for non-fatal falls were not available until\n2000 when the National Electronic Injury Surveillance\nSystem All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) was implemented.\nA prospective study in New Zealand,1 and retrospective\nstudies in Finland,2 Australia,3 and the US4 have observed\ngender disparities in fall risk and fall related hospitalizations\namong different populations. This is the first US study to use\nnational data to quantify gender differences for non-fatal,\nunintentional, fall related injuries among adults age 65 years\nand older treated in emergency departments (EDs). This\nstudy goes beyond previous reports and characterizes these\ninjuries by diagnosis, part of the body affected, and\ndisposition.\nMore than a third of older adults fall each year5 6 and 10\u00ad\n20% of falls cause serious injuries such as fractures or head\ntraumas.7 Fall injury rates increase sharply with age3 8 and\nthese injuries are associated with significant morbidity,\nreduced mobility, decreased functioning, and loss of inde-\npendence.9 One study found that 12% of older adults who fell\nsubsequently required long term nursing home care.10\nCurrently, 34.8 million Americans are 65 years of age and\npopulation ages, the numbers of fall related injuries will\nincrease. In 1994, the total cost of all fall related injuries\namong adults 65 years of age and older was $27.3 billion, and\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data from NEISS-AIP for non-fatal injuries for\nyear of data available, and characterized unintentional fall\nrelated injuries among US older adults (defined as people\naged 65 years and older) by gender and age. NEISS-AIP,\noperated by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission,\ncollects data on initial visits for all types and causes of\ninjuries treated in US EDs. For each initial ED visit, coders\nrecord one principal diagnosis--usually the most severe--as\ndetermined by the ED physician or healthcare provider and as\nrecorded in the ED chart, and one primary part of the body\naffected. NEISS-AIP data are drawn from a nationally\nrepresentative subsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals,\nwhich were selected as a stratified probability sample of\nhospitals. These hospitals have a minimum of six beds,\nprovide a 24 hour ED, and are located in the United States\nand its territories.13 NEISS-AIP provides national estimates\nproduct related ED cases each year.\nThe overall estimates for this study were based on\nweighted data for 22 560 older adults treated for fall related\ninjuries at NEISS-AIP hospital EDs during 2001. For the\nanalyses by gender, three cases were excluded because sex\nwas unknown. Each case was assigned a sample weight\nbased on the inverse probability of the hospital being\nselected. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using\na direct variance estimation procedure that accounted for the\nsample weights and complex sample design.

Of these,\n70.5%, were women (table 1). Injury rates increased sharply\nwith age although rates for women were higher in all age\ncategories. Overall, the rates for adults 85 years and older\nwere four to five times that of adults aged 65\u00ad69 years.\nTable 1 shows gender differences for fall related injury\ndiagnoses. Fractures, contusions/abrasions, and lacerations\nresulted in more than three quarters of all injury diagnoses.\nFractures, the most frequent diagnosis, accounted for 37.8%\nof women's and 28.3% of men's injuries. Except for\nlacerations where rates for men and women were similar\n(RR = 1.1), rates for diagnoses were generally higher among\nwomen, most notably for fractures which were 2.2 times\nhigher than for men.\nFor all parts of the body, women's injury rates exceeded\nthose of men. Rate ratios were greatest for injuries of the leg/\nmen and women, injury rates were highest for head/neck\ninjuries. Most fall related injuries did not result in hospital\nadmissions. About three quarters of all patients seen for fall\nrelated injuries were treated and released while only one in\nfive was hospitalized. However, the hospitalization rate for\nwomen was 1.8 times that for men. Furthermore, women's\nhospitalization rates were 2.3 times higher than men's for\nRates for all fall related injury diagnoses increased with\nadvancing age (table 2.) For people aged 85 and older, the\nrates were four to five times higher than for those aged 65\u00ad\n74. Within each age category, rates for all diagnoses except\nlaceration injuries were higher among women. Both men's\nand women's rates for all injury diagnoses (except strain/\nsprain) doubled with each decade of age. In each age group\nand for all parts of the body, women's injury rates exceeded\nmen's. The greatest gender difference in the 65\u00ad74 age group\nwas for leg/foot injuries and in the 85 and older age group, it\nwas for lower trunk injuries. Within each age group,\nhospitalization rates for women were twice that for men.\nWith each decade of age, hospitalization rates for both men\nand women increased about 2.7 times.\nDISCUSSION\nUsing national data, this study quantified gender differences\nin non-fatal, unintentional fall related injuries among adults\naged 65 years and older treated in EDs. The extent of these\ndifferences was striking. Women sustained fall related injury\nrates 40\u00ad60% higher than men of comparable age. Women's\nhospitalization rates for fall injuries were about 81% higher\nthen men's, suggesting that women sustained more severe\ninjuries. However, hospitalization per se is only a rough proxy\nfor injury severity. Severity may be more accurately reflected\nby the length of hospital stay, type of treatment needed (for\nexample, surgery), need for rehabilitation services, and\nwhether, after release, the patient returned home or was\ntransferred to a long term care facility. However, factors such\nas the presence of other medical conditions certainly can\naffect these outcomes. Data about such outcomes were not\navailable through NEISS-AIP. Consequently, we could not\nascertain to what extent patients were functionally impaired\nnor could we predict the impact that fall related injuries\nmight have on future health and wellbeing.\nSome of the observed disparity may reflect gender\ndifferences in levels of physical activity. Muscle weakness\nand loss of lower body strength, often caused by inactivity, is\na well known risk factor for falling.14 Data on older adults\nTable 1 Non-fatal unintentional fall related injuries among adults aged 65 years and older treated in US emergency\nMen Women\nNumber\nWeighted\nestimate\nNumber\nWeighted\nestimate\nRate\nratio\nAge (years)\nInjury diagnosis\nPart of body affected\nDisposition\nHeld for observation/\nunknown\n\u00c0Unstable estimate because of sample size ,20.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nExamination Survey (NHANES 1) Follow up Survey estab-\nlished that men were more physically active than women,15\nmen had greater lower body strength.16 Although non-fatal\nfall injury rates were higher among women, fatal fall rates\nare known to be higher among men.17 Differences in physical\nactivity levels may influence the circumstances or events\ncontributing to men's lower injury rate, as well as help\nexplain their higher mortality.\nThe greatest gender difference was in women's fracture\nrate which was twice as high as the rate for men. This\ndifference has been observed by others.18 19 This finding,\nalong with the gender difference seen for rates of lower trunk\ninjuries, may be due in large part to differences in hip\nfracture rates. Hip fractures, the most serious type of fall\nrelated fracture, is a leading contributor to excess mortality,\ndisability, and reduced quality of life.20 21 Women's increased\nlikelihood of hip fracture is frequently attributed to reduced\nbone mass.22 23 Bone mass for both men and women peaks\naround age 30 and then declines about 0.5% per year for men\nand 1% per year for women.24 Additionally, women suffer a\nrapid loss of bone density for about five years following\nmenopause. A 1992 study of women in Rochester,\nof 50 women over age 80) had osteopenia, a reduction in\nbone mass two standard deviations below the mean for\nnormal women under age 40.25 Although reduced bone mass\nis a significant risk factor, falling sideways onto the hip is\nusually necessary to cause a hip fracture.23 26 Specialized hip\npads have been developed that reduce the force of impact on\nthe hip joint when a fall occurs27 and can prevent hip\nfractures among high risk individuals.28\nFor the part of the body affected, the highest rates for both\nmen and women were for head/neck injuries, although the\nstudy of injury related ED visits found that for all ages, falls\nwere the most common cause of traumatic brain injury\n(TBI).29 After age 65, the TBI rate for women exceeded that\nfor men while women age 85 and older had the highest rate.\nOur finding differs from a recent report that found fall\nrelated TBI hospitalization rates in California were higher for\nmen.30 It is possible that men sustain more severe TBI injuries\nthan women, perhaps due to the underlying causes or\ncircumstances of their falls.\nThis study of older adult non-fatal fall related injuries is\nsubject to a number of limitations. Firstly, it includes only\ninjuries treated in EDs. ED patients likely suffer more serious\ninjuries; they may be older, more frail, and/or have more\nchronic conditions than older adults who fall and sustain few\nor minor injuries. Because NEISS-AIP includes a limited\nnumber of variables, it was not possible to compare these\npatients directly with other groups. Secondly, NEISS-AIP\ncoders record only one injury (generally the most severe) and\none part of the body affected. In the case of multiple injuries,\nsome underreporting may occur. The system does not include\ninjuries treated in physicians' offices or other outpatient\nsettings and those that did not require medical attention.\nThirdly, we excluded fatal injuries that occurred before or in\nthe ED because NEISS-AIP does not provide detailed\ninformation about injury deaths. In addition, we did not\ninclude deaths that occurred following treatment because we\ndid not have information about the patient's status after\nleaving the ED or the hospital. However, deaths represent\nfewer than 1% of fall related injuries.31 Although NEISS-AIP\ndoes not include information about injury severity, we\nprobably have captured the majority of significant fall related\ninjuries because most serious and costly injuries are treated\nin EDs. Fourthly, generalizing to the US population may be\nlimited by selection bias because the people who are treated\nin EDs may differ from the general US population. Finally,\nthe NEISS AIP coding system has a fixed number of\ncategories for primary part of the body affected and for the\nprincipal diagnosis relevant to consumer product related\ninjuries. ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes32 were not available in\nthe medical record at the time these data were collected;\ntherefore, specific types of injuries (for example, hip fracture,\nTBI) could not be accurately identified. Currently, NEISS-AIP\nhas only one complete year of data but it will be possible to\nanalyze fall related injury trends within a few years as more\ndata become available.\nTable 2 Non-fatal, unintentional fall related injury rates* by age among adults aged\n65 years and older treated in US emergency departments, 2001\nMen Women\nAge group Age group\nInjury diagnosis\nUnknown \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0\nPart of body affected\nDisposition\nHeld for observation/\nunknown\n\u00c0Unstable estimate because of sample size ,20.\nGender differences for fall related injuries 117\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nKnowledge about the circumstances surrounding falls is\nvital for developing prevention strategies. A number of\nresearchers have reported on types and mechanisms of fall\ninjuries. A study of fall related hip fractures in a homo-\ngeneous elderly urban population found that 75% fell ``while\nstanding or walking''.33 Another study analyzed the external\ncause of injury codes (E codes) for California patients\nhospitalized for fall related injuries.4 These researchers found\nthat the largest proportion of falls (41%) occurred on the\nsame level, and the hospitalization rate for women was twice\nthe rate for men. However, detailed information about the\nlocation, circumstances, or events preceding the fall was not\navailable. A follow up study of people treated in EDs for all\nfall related injuries could provide such information and help\nidentify high risk situations and behaviors surrounding fall\nevents.\nFalls and fall related injuries are age related problems and\nthe world's population is aging rapidly. Between July 1999\nand July 2000, the total size of the world's older adult\npopulation increased by 9.5 million people.34 Although the\nindustrialized nations of Europe, North America, and Japan\nhave the highest percentages of older adults, 59% of the\nworld's elderly live in developing countries.34 Women live\nlonger than men and typically marry men older than\nthemselves. Therefore, virtually all countries have higher\nnumbers of older women than men. It is reasonable to expect\nthat older women in many countries, like those in the US,\nwill be disproportionately affected by fall related injuries.\nThis is the first US study to quantify gender differences for\nnon-fatal unintentional fall related injuries among adults\naged 65 years and older treated in EDs. Nationally, an\nestimated 1.64 million older adults were treated for fall\nhospitalized. And, as our population ages, the number of fall\ninjuries will increase. This represents an enormous burden to\nindividuals, society, and to the healthcare system. Non-fatal\nfall related injuries disproportionately affect the health and\nquality of life of older women, who comprise 58% of the US\npopulation over age 65.11. Because the US population is aging,\nthis problem will increase unless we take preventive action.\nMuch is known about effective fall prevention strate-\ngies.14 35 We now need to refine, promote, and implement\nthese interventions. We also need to learn how to successfully\ndisseminate intervention programs and to promote wide-\nspread adoption at local level. In addition, further research is\nneeded to tailor interventions for populations with differing\ncharacteristics and risk factors, and to determine the under-\nlying causes and/or circumstances of falls and how these\ndiffer for men and women. Clarifying these differences and\nobtaining information about the location and events preced-\ning a fall related injury is vital to identifying high risk\nbehaviors and situations, and for developing and implement-\ning targeted fall prevention strategies.\n"
