    "abstract": "Abstract\nScholars have long been interested in the complementary relationships forged by membership groups and political parties.\nThe post-bellum period presents an opportunity to consider these connections using a case study of two groups concerned\nwith the ills of alcohol, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the Prohibition Party. Our analysis of\npresidential elections from 1876 to 1900 reveals that--although women were disenfranchised at the time--the WCTU's\norganization and infrastructure was essential to early Prohibition Party success. In 1884, the first election after the two\ncreated a formal alliance in 1882, the strength of the WCTU helped the party grow its voter base. However, the two slowly\ndiverged over how to achieve prohibition, and this relationship dissipated; there is little evidence of any significant connection\nbetween the groups after 1884. This supports the proposition that a shared means of accomplishing goals is an essential\nelement of an effective group\u00adparty partnership.\n",

The movement toward\nnational prohibition was preceded by state and local efforts\nto shut down the traffic, sale, and consumption of intoxicat-\ning beverages. Given the intensity of feelings and the scope\nof activity, the abolition of alcohol became the political issue\nthat trumped all others for a large number of committed\ncitizens.\nProhibition also gained particular popularity among polit-\nically active women. Many had played key roles in abolition-\nearly temperance groups (e.g., Dannenbaum, 1981; Tyrrell,\n1982), and others had been involved with benevolent societ-\nthe abolition of slavery, many women turned to addressing\nother ills in society that required correction, and they soon\nsought to heal the country and the family by advocating for\npublic policies that promoted a \"sober and pure world.\" It is\nnot without reason, then, that the largest women's organiza-\ntion up to that time, the Woman's Christian Temperance\nUnion (WCTU), formed around the topic.\nEstablished in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1874, the group's mis-\nsion was to \"protect the home\"--and by extension, create\ngreater personal and financial security for U.S. families--\nthrough the prohibition of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.\nEarly leaders, including Annie Wittenmyer, Mary Johnson,\nMary Ingram, and Frances Willard (whose name is most fre-\nquently associated with the group), viewed the group's cause\nas part of an attempt to exercise political voice, even without\nthe franchise. Prohibition was a logical policy goal for\nwomen of this era, who were largely restricted to the private\nsphere, and were, thus, particularly susceptible to the social\ncosts of alcohol abuse. In addition, it was considered\nunseemly for women of the era to spend much time in tav-\nerns and saloons, where much political business was con-\nducted. As a result, few issues important to women and\nfamily--including education, child custody, and divorce--\ntypically received the attention of political leaders of the day.\nThe cause of prohibition, thus, became a way for women to\nbring indirect and direct attention to these issues.\nThe WCTU grew rapidly in membership and status, even-\ntually becoming the largest women's organization in the\nworld. In the decade after its founding, it became organized\n1Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC, USA\n2High Point University, NC, USA\n3Pennsylvania State University-Altoona, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAdam Chamberlain, Coastal Carolina University, P.O.

Under Willard's lead-\nalso expanded to include other issues, such as immigration,\nsuffrage, and workplace safety.\nOf course, temperance and prohibition in the post-bellum\nera were not causes solely supported by women. Prior to the\nformation of the WCTU, a few committed male prohibition-\nists led by John Russell formed the Prohibition Party in 1869;\nits ultimate goal was a constitutional ban on the production,\nconsumption, importation, and trade of alcohol. As one\nnational Prohibition Party platform noted, alcohol was\nnow so threatening the perpetuity of all our social and political\ninstitutions, that the suppression of the same by a national party,\norganized therefor [sic], is the greatest object to be accomplished\nby the voters of our country; it is of such importance that it, of\nright, ought to control the political action of all our patriotic\ncitizens, until such suppression is accomplished. (Prohibition\nWhether to work alongside the Prohibition Party or whether\nto work through other channels led to serious debates within\nthe WCTU.As president of the WCTU, Frances Willard advo-\ncated working alongside the party. She spoke at Prohibition\nParty conventions, and later, other members of the WCTU\nalso served as delegates to these meetings. Still, opposition\nexisted between those wanting less emphasis placed on parti-\nsan, electoral approaches to prohibition and those who desired\na close connection with this minor party. These conflicting\nviewpoints lead us to ask an important question: Is there a con-\nnection between WCTU membership and the performance of\nthe Prohibition Party at the ballot box?\nIt is worthwhile to explore this question for several rea-\nsons. First, the two organizations began within 5 years of one\nanother, and their growth in support in the 1880s paralleled\neach other. Yet, to date, scholars have not quantitatively\nassessed the nature of the WCTU\u00adProhibition Party relation-\nship. Second, and as an extension of the previous point,\nexploring this question allows us to speak to recent scholar-\nship theorizing that political parties are not solely creations\nof politicians, but instead are the creations of various orga-\nnized interests banding together (Bawn et al., 2012). A mem-\nbership organization such as the WCTU, then, could play an\nessential role in a party's development. Finally, it is also\ninteresting to examine whether and how a female-only orga-\nnization, prior to woman suffrage, could have significantly\ninfluenced the trajectory of a male-dominated political party,\neven if a third party.\nTo study these questions, we focus on the connection\nbetween the strength of state WCTU membership and\nProhibition Party voting in the late 1800s. Using WCTU\ndues, weighted by a state's population, as a measure of group\nstrength, we find a relationship between the group and\nProhibition Party presidential voting in 1884, 2 years after\nthe organizations formed an official alliance. This evidence\nshows that a women's organization influenced electoral poli-\ntics prior to widespread voting rights for women. However,\nas the Prohibitionists sought to modernize their political\norganization by relying less on female activists, and as the\nWCTU responded by becoming less interested in working\nwithin a minor party, this effect quickly disappeared. These\nfindings underscore women's political capacity during the\npre-suffrage era while also revealing that shared strategies\nfor achieving policy goals, and not necessarily the alignment\nof goals, are the critical component in maintaining a mem-\nbership group\u00adpolitical party connection.\nThe WCTU\u00adProhibition Connection\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the two organizations\nformed after the Civil War, the Prohibition Party in 1869 and\nthe WCTU in 1874. But, it was more than just temporal prox-\nimity and mission that kept these two organizations in close\nalignment. In Pathways to Prohibition, Szymanski (2003b)\nnotes that these two \"radical\" organizations found their early\nleadership in the more secretive International Order of the\nGood Templars, a temperance organization formed during\nthe Masons, the Good Templars allowed participation by\nboth men and women.\nWith origins in the antebellum temperance movement,\nwhich was especially popular in the North among religious,\nnative-born individuals, and sharing a similar goal of consti-\ntutional prohibition, these two groups began by attracting\nformer Republicans and women who had favored that party.\nPre-war abolitionists also saw this as an opportunity to cure\nsociety of yet another ill, and this group of experienced polit-\nical activists included both men and women. For example,\nGerrit Smith, the New York abolitionist who had helped to\nform the Liberty Party, and had been active in the pre-war\ntemperance movement, was part of the effort to create the\nProhibition Party. Likewise, longtime WCTU President\nFrances Willard was raised in a staunchly Republican, aboli-\ntionist1 family; she even attended President Garfield's inau-\nguration in 1881 and went to the White House to present,\nfrom theWCTU, a portrait of Lucy Hayes, wife of Republican\nPresident Rutherford B. Hayes and a temperance woman\nherself (Bordin, 1986). Overall, then, the origins of these two\norganizations, as well as their ideological and policy inclina-\ntions, aligned well with one another.\nThis said, the WCTU was, at first, non-partisan, and\nespecially so under the leadership of President Annie\nWittenmyer (Andersen, 2011). Even when Frances Willard\nbecame president in 1879, the organization remained osten-\nsibly non-partisan, though most WCTU women were likely\nsympathetic to the Republicans. Yet, after meeting with men\nfrom various temperance organizations and the Prohibition\nChamberlain et al. 3\nParty, Willard decided to push for a closer relationship with\naddress, she noted that \"[w]e should not consider our own\ninterests to the exclusion of the interests represented by this\nindependent movement\" (Woman's Christian Temperance\nUnion, 1882: lxxxv), in part because the Prohibition Party\nhad recently espoused woman suffrage at its previous con-\nvention. In fact, the party reorganized itself in 1882 as the\n\"Prohibition Home Protection Party,\" which, according to\nAndersen (2011), \"combined it with the WCTU and the hun-\ndreds of thousands of members this organization had\namassed since its beginnings\" (p. 148). Andersen argues--\nalthough she does not empirically demonstrate the point--\nthat this alliance \"mapped partisanship--the predominant\nform of political organization in nineteenth-century\nAmerica--onto the numbers, structures, and leadership of\nIn the wake of this change, though, Willard remained\nopen to state auxiliaries working with major parties, noting\n\". . . we have not been slow to applaud the loyalty of any\nparty to Prohibition, gratefully recognizing the action of\nRepublicans in Iowa and Democrats in Arkansas\" (Woman's\nChristian Temperance Union, 1883, p. 49; italics in original).\nBut, by the 1884 convention, just prior to the presidential\nelection, Willard's endorsement of the national Prohibition\nParty's efforts was firmer and clearer. As she stated concern-\ning the Republicans and Democrats, \"Existing parties can\nnot [sic], in the very nature of the case, take up this question\n[of national, constitutional prohibition]. Not to this end were\nthey born; not for this cause did they come into the world\"\nAlthough there was some opposition to this alliance, the vote\nconcerning the proposed WCTU resolutions of 1884, which\nincluded a plank endorsing the Prohibition Party, passed with\nAlthough most delegates accepted the results of the vote, the\nscars were still fresh for those who had opposed the arrange-\nment, especially the Iowa WCTU (see Kleppner, 1979, for\ndetails on parties and prohibition in Iowa). In fact, this group,\nalong with a few other wayward delegates, seceded from the\nmain WCTU in 1889 to form a truly non-partisan WCTU.\nPutting aside this minority, the WCTU\u00adProhibition con-\nnection, formed under Willard's leadership, went beyond\nmerely informal support; it became a symbiotic relationship.\nThe Prohibition Party did not create formal party structures\nand did not keep track of membership dues, but instead relied\non members from the WCTU, the Good Templars, and a\nsmaller organization, the Sons of Temperance, to run their\ncampaigns. And, though the Good Templars were larger in\nthe WCTU was a growing organization while the Good\nTemplars were on the decline (see Szymanski, 2003b). This\nexplains why Lisa Andersen's (2011) work on the\nProhibitionist\u00adWCTU relationship argues that the new minor\nparty \"depended on women workers and women leaders to\nhelp their fledgling party meet the demands of a competitive\nparty system\" (p. 137). This also explains why the Prohibition\nParty allowed female participation at its meetings and\nendorsed suffrage. The party needed to develop an organiza-\ntion that could attract support from election to election, and\nprior to the WCTU\u00adProhibition alliance, its \"leaders were\nlooked upon as good political philosophers, but not practical\nof the WCTU, who, like their brethren in the woman suffrage\nmovement, had developed a strong nationwide network of\nstate and local affiliates, were good at such organizing.\nBut from the perspective of WCTU leadership, partisan\nactivities were just one component of a broader strategy to\n\"agitate- educate- and legislate\" for change. In 1884, Willard\nstated that, \"One candidate who incarnates our principles is of\nmore political value to our cause than ten thousand signatures\nto a petition. But great petitions are great educators of the peo-\nple, and have always been followed by new party alignments\"\n(Minutes, 1884, p. 70). Thus, though the group's efforts were\npartisan minded, they still retained a reform-minded approach\nto solving society's problems. The working class could be\nimproved, and middle-class values imparted to them, first and\nforemost by accepting temperance, which would create a cas-\ncading effect of positive changes to individuals and society at\nlarge (Gusfield, 1955). Accordingly, the group used a variety\nof tactics, from expanding temperance education in public\nmeetings in railroad and mining camps, to achieve social\nchange and working alongside the woman suffrage move-\nment. Engagement in these various reform activities meant\nthat female activists were developing political capital; likely,\nmany women were attracted to the group because of these\nsocial and purposive benefits (Salisbury, 1969). In turn, per-\nhaps by chance, the WCTU's political empowerment of\nwomen, coupled with Willard's election and direction, aided\nthe cause of the Prohibition Party, too.\nHowever, the Prohibition Party began to move away from\nthe 1884 presidential election signaled to many male\nProhibitionists that changes were needed to increase support.\nTo mimic the major parties' organization and outreach, the\nrole of women would have to decline and the party would\nneed to moderate on woman suffrage, which turned off many\nwomen to the organization. Conceivably, this would allow\nthe party to attract more Southern support, though prohibi-\ntionists in this region seemed more accepting of local efforts\nto stop the sale and manufacture of alcohol, not constitu-\ntional prohibition. Furthermore, debates about whether the\nparty should be focused solely on prohibition or embrace a\nbroader agenda created a divide that led the party to split in\n1896 between \"narrow\" and \"broad\" gauge platforms.\nNeither put an official suffrage plank in their platforms,\nwhich \"tended to bring on a coldness in the attitude of some\n4 SAGE Open\nto this, and because the party was not successful at getting\npotential office seekers elected, \"the [Prohibition] Party\nrelied upon moral force and amateurism and became increas-\ningly anachronistic in twentieth-century politics\" (Blocker,\nwomen's issues and roles in the party to \"professionalize\"\nand appeal to Southerners. This moved the Prohibition Party\naway from its radical antebellum roots, with connections to\nwomen's activism, in an attempt to become nationally\nrelevant.\nOf course, it was not a one-way street, as the WCTU\nmoved away from the Prohibition Party, too. Although\nWillard stuck by the Prohibitionists into the early 1890s, a\nfew factors weakened the relationship between the two. First,\nthe secession of the Iowa delegation and its allies signaled\nthat there was dissent over the organization's connection to\npolitics. Second, Willard attempted to bring the various\nreforms movements, including the Populists, together under\none ticket for the 1892 presidential election. This failed, in\nlarge part because Prohibitionists she was working with felt\nthe attempt involved compromising on prohibition and\nwoman suffrage, and Populists were often unwilling to\naccept these planks (Bordin, 1986). Third, although she\nremained the leader of the national WCTU, Willard's physi-\ncal departure for Europe seems to have weakened the bond\nother members had with the Prohibition Party (Bordin,\npresidency, Lillian M. N. Stevens, oversaw the moderation\nof the group, appealing more directly to the South and its\nlocal (but not constitutional) means of restricting alcohol\n(Szymanski, 2003a).Although likely due, in part, to the rapid\nexpansion of theAnti-Saloon League throughout the country,\nStevens' actions reflected a moderation that was not as\naccepted in Willard's time (but see Ivy, 1998, on Willard's\nattempts to build the WCTU in the South).\nIn addition, changes in ballot laws accelerated this sup-\nposed disconnect. The success of the Populist or People's\nParty created concerns, generally among Republicans, over\nPopulists' ability to fuse ballots with Democrats. After\nRepublican-led state governments again rose to prominence\nthroughout the North, efforts were made to place ballots\nin the South, Democrats reacted to the Populists' success by\nattempting to eliminate the competition (Hirano & Snyder,\n2007). Southern state governments implemented signature\nrequirements as barriers to ballot access, hurting not only the\nPopulists (who were also affected by bans on \"fusing\" party\ntickets) but also the Prohibitionists. Women were especially\nmarginalized by this reform, as the laws often required signa-\ntures from voters, and woman suffrage was quite limited at\nthis time (Andersen, 2011). Thus, without the ability to con-\nstruct and distribute ballots and without the guarantee of a\nplace on the ballot, the Prohibition Party's success waned\n(Andersen, 2012). Although the party got close to winning\n2% of the popular vote in the non-competitive presidential\nelection of 1904, it never again matched the success of ear-\nlier nationwide campaigns.\nDespite these divergent paths, in the early stages of both\norganizations, the connection between them was supposedly\nquite strong. Scholars, such as those cited in this piece (see,\n2003b), have documented the relationship using anecdotal\nand qualitative evidence. However, research has not statisti-\ncally illustrated the nature of this relationship. An empirical\ninvestigation of the ties between these two groups will help\nus to better understand the nature and extent of the connec-\ntion between pressure groups and political parties. It is, after\nall, one thing to say that the organizations worked together\non the campaign trail, but if this support did not translate into\nvotes, it ultimately had little immediate effect on the compo-\nsition of government. An empirical illustration of this rela-\ntionship also allows us to better quantify the impact that\ndisenfranchised women had on the political process in the\nData\nWe consider the relationship between state-level WCTU\nmembership and state-level voting for the Prohibition Party\nrise and fall of the relationship between the two organiza-\ntions, and allow us to consider the changing nature of these\nconnections over time and as a result of conscious shifts in\ngroup strategy.\nTo measure WCTU membership, we rely on data pre-\nsented in the Minutes of the National Woman's Christian\nNational Woman's Christian Temperance Union (1895-\n1900). Specifically, yearly data were gathered on the amount\nof dues given to the national union by the state unions, which\nwas based on the size of the state unions. Because these\namounts vary quite a bit, in part due to state populations,\nthese dues are adjusted, per 10,000 in a state's population, for\nStates without recorded dues in a given year are included\nin the analysis, because the absence of dues signifies the\ninability of the WCTU to establish active and effective orga-\nnizations. However, this poses a serious problem for 1876\nand 1880. In these years, WCTU presence in the South was\nalmost non-existent; no Southern states, further, recorded\nProhibition votes for president in either year. In 1876, more-\nover, only 10 non-Southern states recorded Prohibition votes;\n16 did not. But, 21 states had active, dues-paying WCTUs,\ncompared with five that did not. Furthermore, two states\nrecorded Prohibition voting without WCTU organizations,\nand, critically, 13 states had WCTU organizations without\nProhibition voting. Similarly, in 1880, seven of the 27 states\noutside the South had no dues-paying WCTU, 11 of the\nChamberlain et al. 5\nstates had no Prohibition voting, and 13 of the 27 states\n(almost half) had either no evidence of the organizations\n(five), WCTU formation but no Prohibition Party (six), or\nProhibition voting with no WCTU (two). We, therefore,\nbegin our multivariate analyses in 1884, when both the\nWCTU and Prohibition Party had more completely devel-\noped national infrastructures and were typically active in\nevery state of the union.2\nTo measure Prohibition Party support in the electorate, we\ncollect vote percentages for the Prohibition Party from Leip's\n(2012) U.S. Election Atlas. Some scholars might question\nwhether other indicators of Prohibition Party strength are\navailable or might be more appropriate. As noted earlier,\nhowever, the party supposedly maintained itself on the backs\nof organizations such as the WCTU; it did not keep its own\nrecords of local and state affiliates (see Szymanski, 2003b).\nTherefore, vote percentages are the best, and perhaps the\nonly, reliable measure of the Prohibition Party's support in a\nstate.\nResults\nThe simplest, yet most effective, means of looking at the\nconnection between Prohibition Party presidential voting in\na state and the WCTU dues per population in a state is\nthrough correlations. This is displayed in Table 1 by using\nthe amount of state dues, adjusted for population; for refer-\nence, the Prohibition Party's percentage of the presidential\nvote in each year is included, too.\nA clear pattern emerges. The relationship was strongest in\nthe early 1880s, which corresponds to the growing partner-\nship between the party and group, culminating in their for-\n1892, which is consistent with previous research suggesting\nthat the two organizations began to diverge during this era.\nThis foreshadows the WCTU's movement away from the\nProhibition Party in the mid- to late-1890s, evidenced by the\ncorrelations generally confirm what prior qualitative research\nhas suggested.\nHowever, we also know that the WCTU and Prohibition\nParty proclaimed that they were above regional politics, and\nboth groups were interested in building a national alliance\nduring the post-bellum era. Even so, it has been noted that\nSouthern support for both organizations was weak early on,\nand efforts did not truly gain traction in the region until after\nthe separation of the WCTU\u00adProhibition Party alliance. It is\npossible, then, that region might affect the correlations noted\nabove.\nTo test the accuracy of this claim, ordinary least squares\nregression models are used to predict Prohibition Party presi-\ndential voting as a function of WCTU strength and whether a\nstate is Southern or non-Southern. The results from 1884 to\n1900 are provided in Table 2. After adjusting for regional-\nism, the relationship between WCTU and Prohibition Party\nsupport tends to be weaker than suggested solely by correla-\ntions. In the 1884 election, which saw the formal alliance\nbetween the two lead to the \"Prohibition Home Protection\nParty,\" dues weighted according to a state's population are\nsignificant. However, 1884 is the only year where this is the\ncase. This said, the South dummy variable is negative and\nfor both organizations was weak in the region. Additional\nmodels, with controls for other third-party voting, the margin\nof victory between the top two presidential candidates in a\nstate, and Prohibition Party voting in the previous presiden-\ntial election, confirm the more parsimonious presentation of\nresults provided here. (See the supplementary appendix for\nthese models and related figures.)\nnificant explanatory variable of Prohibition voting, though\nneither are WCTU dues. The Prohibition strategy of appeal-\ning to the South, then, seems to have met with at least a mod-\nicum of success. The highest percentage of the vote for the\n\"narrow gauge\" platform in 1896, which carried forth under\nthe traditional Prohibition Party banner, was in Georgia,\nwhen Joshua Levering, a Southern Baptist leader, was the\npresidential candidate. Likewise, in 1900, the largest vote\npercentage for the Prohibitionists came in Florida. Neither\nwas a state where the WCTU claimed much support.3\nThese results, then, clearly speak to earlier scholars'\ncontentions about the reliance of the political party on the\nwomen's organization. The WCTU\u00adProhibition connection\nforged in 1882 appears to have helped the Prohibition Party\nin the North (and hence, throughout the country) in the 1884\npresidential election, but the tumultuous battles within the\nparty after that year, which culminated with separate cam-\npaigns in 1896 for the two distinct factions, subsequently\nweakened the relationship between the two entities.\nFurthermore, the organizations' reforms that began in the\nmid- to late-1880s moved the groups in opposite directions.\nTable 1. Correlations Between State-Level Dues to the National\nYear\nDollar amount per\nProhibition vote\npercentage\nNote. WCTU = Woman's Christian Temperance Union.\naThis represents the more popular \"narrow gauge\" Prohibition Party vote.\nMoney and the \"broad gauge,\" which split from the party's convention\nto promote such issues as free silver, are correlated at .17 and .08,\nrespectively, with 0.14% of the national vote. The correlation between the\ncombined 1896 vote for the two splinter groups, and WCTU state-level\ndues per population, is .23.\n6 SAGE Open\nAs the WCTU took steps that slowly moved it away from the\nparty and toward other issue areas, the Prohibition Party\nbecame more focused on building a national party with a\nstronger base of support in the South (though Prohibition\nvoting remained much weaker there than it was outside the\nregion). In many ways, the goals were at cross purposes, and\ndrove a wedge between the groups, eroding the symbiotic\nrelationship that once existed. The regional division both\nwanted to downplay was, in fact, a key component in the\ndisintegration of their formal relationship.\nConsidering both organizations grew out of the Northern\nabolitionist impulse after the Civil War, this case reveals how\nshared policy goals can be at odds with political expediency.\nThe mainstreaming and moderation of two similar-minded\ngroups required separation as one (the WCTU) grew to\nprominence and the other (the Prohibition Party) struggled\nbefore withering into obscurity. Even if the connection was\nnot as strong as it was in 1884, there was still some connec-\ntion between the two throughout the period, as their shared\nmissions aligned. But, once the third-party supporters\nattempted to mainstream the organization, which required\nseparating from its radical Northern past and other social and\npolitical reforms, including woman suffrage, the WCTU\nmoved its growing support away from the party. Thus, there\nwas no strong, significant connection between the two orga-\nnizations once their strategies for achieving their shared\ngoals diverged.\nConclusion\nThe results presented above provide quantitative evidence\nfor the rise and fall of an electoral connection between the\nactivities of the WCTU and the Prohibition Party, thus reaf-\nfirming the historical, qualitative claims of Andersen (2011)\nand Szymanski (2003b). Our results specifically affirm the\nhistorical narrative of growing links around the 1884 elec-\ntion, followed by a declining connection thereafter. Much of\nthis owes to regional divisions between the two groups, as\nwell as varying strategies for achieving their shared goals.\nThe present research also adds to our scholarly under-\nstanding of party development, especially the recent theory\nthat political parties form from the efforts of interest organi-\nzations (Bawn et al., 2012). Our findings underscore that this\nsymbiotic relationship is highly dependent on the demands\nand resources of the group's and party's adherents and stan-\ndard bearers. In other words, shared emphasis on one policy\nposition, or a series of related positions, is not enough to\nbring parties and interest groups together; there must be\ngreater consistency in goals and activist strategies. In this\ncase, Prohibition Party candidates, looking to win election to\noffice, openly advocated for change--including moving\naway from the call for woman suffrage--to align themselves\nwith major-party organizations. This decision allowed candi-\ndates to assert some role in the development of the party (see,\nfor example, Aldrich, 1995), but moved the Prohibition Party\naway from the WCTU, whose already skeptical adherents\nhad doubts about the party's general repositioning.\nFurthermore, the attempts by the two organizations to appeal\nto Southern voters, for the Prohibitionists, and Southern\nwomen, for the WCTU, led them to pursue different strate-\ngies, too.\nThese results also reveal that shared policy goals did not\nunite the two organizations so much as the shared means of\nachieving those goals. As powerful as the WCTU became,\nand as influential as it was in volunteer and lobbying pro-\ngrams, its leaders realized that the best strategy involved dis-\ntancing themselves from radical minor-party politics once\nthe Prohibitionists began to \"professionalize\" and eschew\nfemale assistance. However, when the organizations' means\nof achieving goals aligned, the relationship worked. This\nsuggests that membership groups, seen by many as the back-\nbone of political parties (Bawn et al., 2012), are not wedded\nto electoral politics once they participate in such politics;\ninstead, it appears to be a fluid system, whereby a powerful\nmembership organization can move from aiding a party back\nto pressure politics, and build even more political clout. So\ntaken together, parties and interest groups may couple and\ndecouple, even with a common policy goal such as prohibi-\ntion, if there is a disagreement over the strategies taken to\nachieve that goal.\nFinally, this analysis illustrates women's influence in the\npolitical system prior to enfranchisement. First, like other\nstudies of the role of women in the abolition movement (e.g.,\nJeffrey, 1998), it provides clear evidence that disadvantaged\ngroups can wield power in the electoral arena, even without\nthe right to vote. Contrary to the assumption that women\nNote. Ordinary least squares regression models.\n*p < .05, two-tailed test.\nChamberlain et al. 7\nplayed little role in electoral politics prior to becoming\nenfranchised, what women lacked in such power, they often\nmade up for in organizational skill, social networking, and\npolitical activism. Thus, as this analysis of the Prohibition\nParty and WCTU illustrates, a male-driven political party did\nbenefit from the backing of a women's organization. In this\ncase, the Prohibition Party's national vote for president saw\n0.11% in the former to 1.5% in the latter), when the alliance\nmade between the two organizations, in 1882, was at its\nstrongest.\nSecond, and as an extension, this analysis shows that the\nprospects of a party, albeit a minor party, were directly\naffected by the growth, and eventual turn in orientation, of a\npowerful women's organization. The federated nature of the\nWCTU allowed women to pursue different agendas in their\nstates and localities; when major parties fed into this, the\nProhibition Party was, thus, weakened. And, although\nthe national WCTU would, at least in words, support the\nProhibition Party's cause at the federal level, even as the lat-\nter sought to limit women's participation in the party, it never\nspecified how state unions should operate. It understood that\nstate unions needed to be independent of the Prohibition\nParty to be successful in state and local politics. As such, the\nWCTU showed itself to be more politically adept than its\nmale-dominated, electoral counterpart.\nThis, then, raises questions about the relationship between\nthe WCTU and the Prohibition Party that demand attention\nin the future. In what ways did state organizations formalize\n(or not formalize) the relationships between these groups,\nand how did that translate into candidate support? Did this\nconnection between the two organizations lead to more pol-\nicy gains or create hurdles to policy making? Is the WCTU's\nexperience in the electoral realm that much different than\nthat of the first \"true\" interest group, the Anti-Saloon League\n(see Clemens, 1997)? Studying these simple, straightforward\nextensions of the findings presented here can potentially help\na range of scholars better evaluate this historical era while\nutilizing it as a testing ground for other theories related to\npolitical organizations and social movements.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Many women's rights activists in the post-bellum era had been\ntrained and socialized in the abolition movement. In fact, first\nwave feminism and the Seneca Falls Convention have their\nroots in the treatment of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia\nMott at the World Anti-Slavery Society meeting in London in\n1840. It was, thus, one of the great betrayals of these early\nwomen's rights activists that the Civil War Amendments to the\nU.S. Constitution neither included explicit legal protections\non the basis of gender nor extended the franchise to women.\nFrederick Douglass famously remarked to Stanton at the time\nthat, \"Now is the Negro's hour.\"\n2. It should be noted that regressions on the non-South only in\na significant connection between prohibition voting and\nWoman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) strength\nat the p < .05 level; weighted dues, by population, were not\nsignificant. But, given the number of states where WCTU\npresence and Prohibition voting both occurred (well below\n20 cases in both years), the results for the unweighted dues\nare largely the product of both organizations forming in the\nsame states where prohibition was popular. In addition, Ohio,\nwhere the WCTU had its strongest support from the Women's\nTemperance Crusade, was an outlier in 1876; removing it\nmade the unweighted dues predictor not significant at the p <\n.05 level. Finally, the vote percentages are so low for the party\nthat making an empirical case for a connection seems suspect\n(means of .06 and .09 in the North, respectively, with maxi-\n3. Although these states are each outliers for their respec-\ntive election, it is imperative to include them in the models\nbecause they are clear examples of the party's strategy dur-\ning that period. Nevertheless, excluding those two cases\nincreases the correlations between voting and dues per popula-\ntion to .40 and .45, respectively, with a significant, positive\neffect of WCTU dues per population on vote percentages in\nHowever, including controls for previous Prohibition voting,\nthe vote percentage margin between the top two candidates,\nand other third-party voting, eliminates the significance of this\neffect; these controls do not do this, of course, in 1884 (see\nSupplementary Appendix Table A5 for these additional mod-\nels). Likewise, models excluding all Southern states reveal no\nstatistically significant relationship between dues and voting.\nReferences\nAldrich, J. H. (1995). Why parties?
