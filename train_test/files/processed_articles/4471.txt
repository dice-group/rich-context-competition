The wave energy flux for changing water depths is\npresented and the study is carried out at a location in the north-west Portuguese coast, favourable for wave power\ngeneration.

The reactive control strategy, which includes an external damping coefficient and a\nnegative spring term, is used to maximize power absorption by the wave energy converter.

An area that has not received\nmuch focus is the seabed mounted nearshore devices, where\nnearshore is defined as having a water depth between 10 and\nm and is typically located at a distance of 0.5\u00ad2.0\nkm\nfrom the coastline. This may be due to fact that the nearshore\nhas a lower annual average incident wave power as com-\npared to offshore, even though the exploitable resource is\noften only 5%\u00ad10% less. Even though a nearshore site has a\nlower average incident wave power, it possesses a number\nof attractive characteristics.Anearshore location will reduce\nboth the costs and power losses in the cable, which brings\npower back to the shore. A nearshore location will reduce\nthe costs of installation and maintenance and also increase\nthe plant availability by utilizing smaller weather windows\nfor repair and maintenance. The operations and maintenance\ncosts account for perhaps 40% of the net present cost of a\nwave energy converter (WEC) (Henry et al., 2010). Hence,\nthis is a significant issue. Moreover, shallow water filters\nout the largest waves, potentially reducing the maximum\nloads required for survival, although placement within the\nwave breaking zone may negate this advantage and can\neven cause the maximum loads to increase. Balancing the\ncosts, benefits and the available resource, it is possible to\ndetermine the ideal water depth for the installation of a wave\nenergy device at a specific location.\nIn order to assess the finite depth effects, one needs to con-\nsider two aspects. First, the limited water depth wave spectrum\nhas to be represented correctly. The existing parametric wave\nspectra have been derived for deep water; however, the wave\ncharacteristics are modified as they approach shallow water.\nSecond, wave climatology database exists for many coastal\nareas, but typically they are obtained from measurements with\nfloaters located at depths greater than 70m.Therefore, it is nec-\nessary to transform the wave climatology scatter diagram from\ndeep to shallow water depths as shown in Bouws et al. (1985).\nShallow water effects on wave\nenergy converters with hydraulic\npower take-off system\nAshank Sinha, D Karmakar and C Guedes Soares\n Keywords\nWave energy flux, TMA spectrum, shallow water, reactive control, nearshore\nCentre for Marine Technology and Ocean Engineering (CENTEC),\nInstituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal\nCorresponding author:\nC Guedes Soares, Centre for Marine Technology and Ocean\nEngineering (CENTEC), Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de\nEmail: c.guedes.soares@centec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt\nSpecial Issue Article\nThe preliminary objective of the present work is to\nobtain a general overview of the wave power resource\n(wave power flux) reduction as the water depth reduces\nand then to determine the reduction in wave power\nextracted by a single floater WEC. The latter aspect is\ninteresting since, on one hand, it is expected that the larg-\nest reduction of the resource occurs for the higher sea\nstates, but on the other hand, the power production of\nWECs is usually limited, which means that above a spe-\ncific value of the wave height, the converted power does\nnot increase. For this reason, it might happen that the\nreduction of wave power flux is not so important for the\nannual energy production. This procedure gives the possi-\nbility to understand what might be the best operational\nlocation for a WEC at an early design stage.\nWith the above-mentioned objectives in mind, it makes\nsense to use a robust, simple and general method to repre-\nsent the modification of the wave spectrum as the water\ndepth reduces. The method has been proposed by Bouws\net al. (1985) and has an additional advantage of representing\naverage bottom topography conditions. In Guedes Soares\nand Caires (1995), the transformation of the offshore wave\nspectra to a finite depth site, using a model for spectral wave\nenergy transfer, has been presented. This spectrum shape,\nnamed TMA, is a transformation of the Joint North Sea\nWave Project (JONSWAP) offshore spectra and is consid-\nered in the present study as the most realistic spectrum to\npoint out the loss of energy resource and power production\nwhen moving from deep water to shallow waters.\nIn the present study, a single floater WEC having a\ncone-cylinder shape as in Sinha et al. (2015b) is used as an\nexample to quantify the loss in extracted wave power with\nreduction in water depth. The floater is coupled with a\nhydraulic power take-off (PTO) system to extract wave\npower. A second-order approximation model is used to\nrepresent the PTO system, with a limitation on the PTO\nbandwidth and the control forces. For point absorbers, it is\nwell known that the appropriate control of the applied PTO\nforces can potentially increase the amount of energy\nextracted from sea waves. Hence, reactive control strategy\nhas been used to maximize the power extraction, which is\nrepresented by an external damping coefficient and a nega-\ntive spring term.\nFinite depth spectral model\nThere are many wave spectra used for offshore waves in\ndeep water, that is, when the wavelength is larger than\ntwice the water depth. A fundamental spectrum is the\nPierson\u00adMoskowitz spectrum, which describes the wave\nspectra for fully developed sea or fully arisen sea (FAS),\nwhen a constant wind blowing infinitely long cannot\nincrease the energy in the waves, but the energy transfer is\nbalanced by dissipation. This spectrum is a one parameter\nspectrum completely described by the wind speed given by\nS g e\nPM\n( ) . ( / )\n    \n= - -\n. is Phillip's constant,  the angular\nfrequency, g the acceleration due to gravity,\n\n= g U\n/ .\n.\nthe wind speed at the height\n19.5m above still water level. Mostly, the sea state is not\nfully developed as the wind speed and direction change,\nthe fetch is too short or the wind duration is not long\nenough, especially for strong winds and high waves\n(Bergdahl, 2009). The two-parameter spectra for devel-\noping seas can be used where the wave height and fre-\nquency are the known parameters. This was originally\nproposed by Bredtschneider and offers more flexibility\nbecause the energy of the spectra can be placed at arbi-\ntrary locations on the frequency axis with the correspond-\ning significant wave height. Such spectra belonging to\nthe PM family are also, somewhat incorrectly, referred to\nas PM spectra (Pierson and Moskowitz, 1964). The\nwidely used spectra are the International Ship Structures\nThe two-parameter spectrum still gives too little free-\ndom to reproduce realistic spectra of the developing sea.\nIn 1973, Hasselmann published the five-parameter\nJONSWAP spectrum, which was one of the results from\ne\np\np\n( ) ( ) ( )\n  \n \n  \n=\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere  is the peak enhancement factor, \np\nthe modal\nangular frequency (peak of spectrum),   \n( ) =\na\nif\n \n<\np\n, the standard deviation of the peak enhancement\nfactor to the left, and   \n( ) =\nb\nif  \n>\np\n, the standard\ndeviation of the peak enhancement factor to the right. The\nparameters  and \nof the PM spectrum also need to be\nchosen.\nThe JONSWAP spectrum is in common use for design\nof drilling platforms in the offshore industry because it\noffers more flexibility with its five parameters, and can\nproduce realistic spectra. The parameters are then chosen\nfrom wave statistics combined with systematic parameter\nfitting. While the JONSWAP spectrum was originally\ndeveloped for developing sea in deep water. However, the\nwaves in shallow areas are often waves coming in from\ndeeper areas into an area where they are affected by the\nlimited water depth. For such cases, the modified\nJONSWAP spectrum in shallow water called the TMA\nspectrum (Transformation spectrum) is used as in Hughes\n(1977). It is based on the fact that low-frequency or equiv-\nalently long-period waves must have a limited height in\nshallow water. Therefore, the expression for the TMA\nspectrum is obtained by multiplying the expression for the\nJONSWAP spectrum with a limited depth function  \n( , )\nh\nas shown in Guedes Soares and Caires (1995). This limited\ndepth function  \n( , )\nh is given by\n110 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(3)\n \n \n \n( , )\n. / , /\n. / ,\nh\nh g h g\nh g\n=\n( ) <\n- -\n( )\nif\nif h\nh g\nh g\n/\n, /\n<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif \n\n\nwhere h is the water depth.\nIn Figure 1, the limited depth function is varied with\nrespect to frequency and a similar observation follows as\ndescribed above in Equation (3). Hence, the expression for\nthe TMA spectrum is of the form\nS g h\nTMA\np p\np\n( ) ( , )exp\nln( )exp\n( )\n    \n\n\n\n \n  \n=\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n + -\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical modelling\nThe equation of motion of an oscillating point absorber in\nheave can be described by Newton's second law as\nmz F F F F\nex rad res PTO reactive\n = + + +\n,\nwhere m is the mass of the floater, \nz the floater accelera-\ntion, Fex\nthe exciting wave force, Frad\nthe radiation force.\nThe radiation force can be decomposed with linear theory\ninto a linear added mass term and a linear hydrodynamic\ndamping term as\nF m z b z\nrad a hyd\n= - -\n( ) ( )\n \nThe hydrostatic restoring force Fres\nis the buoyancy\nforce Fb\nminus the gravity force Fg\n. This force corre-\nsponds to the spring force with a linear spring constant k\nand is expressed as\nF F F V t mg kz\nres arch g\n= - = - = -\nwhere  is the water density, g the acceleration due to\ngravity, V t\n( ) the instantaneous submerged floater volume.\nThe spring constant or hydrostatic restoring coefficient k\nis given by\nk gAw\nwhere Aw\nis the waterline area.\nFPTO reactive\n,\nis the force exerted by the PTO to control\nthe movement of the floater and is expressed as\nF k z b z\nPTO reactive PTO PTO\n,\nThe coefficients kPTO\nand bPTO\nare the optimal coef-\nficients maximizing the average absorbed power by the\nfloater, where kPTO\nis a negative spring term and bPTO\na positive external damping coefficient. The coeffi-\ncients kPTO\nand bPTO\nare not real physical quantities but\ncontrol parameters. Hence FPTO reactive\n,\nis generated as a\nlinear feedback from measurements of the floater move-\nment. This is a causal implementation of the reactive\ncontrol, as the parameters are not changed wave-to-\nwave but tuned according to the current sea state. The\nmaximum absorption of ocean energy is achieved when\nthe velocity of the point absorber is in phase with the\nincident wave force. However, the frequency of the\nocean waves varies, the condition of maximal absorp-\ntion is not automatically fulfilled and a control strategy\nis therefore necessary. If the energy only flows from the\nocean to the electrical grid, the control strategy is typi-\ncally referred to as resistive or passive. On the other\nhand, if the energy flow is bi-directional, the control\nstrategy is referred to as reactive control (Sinha et al.,\nTaking into account all the considerations, the equation\nof motion of a heaving point absorber, coupled with a PTO\nmechanism able to perform reactive control, can be re-\nwritten as\nm m z b b z\nk k z F\na hyd PTO\nPTO ex\n+\n{ } + +\n{ }\n+ +\n{ } =\n( ) ( )\n( )\n \n\n \nThe steady solution of Equation (10) is given by\nz zA mot\n= +\n( )\nsin t\nwhere zA\nand \nmot\nare given by\nz\nF\nk k m m\nb b\nA\nex A\nhyd PTO\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\n\n\n \n \n=\n+\n{ }- +\n{ }\n\n\n\n\n+ +\n{ }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\nFigure 1.

An illustration of the PTO is presented in\nFigure 2. This system consists of a symmetric cylinder oper-\nated in closed-circuit with a swash-plate variable displace-\nment axial-piston pump/motor powering a generator. The\nbi-directional flow is converted to a uni-directional rotation\nby the closed-circuit pump/motor capable of both positive\nand negative swash-plate angles. This study does not cover\nthe dynamic modelling and design of the internal control\nloops of the PTO. Instead, a second-order approximation of\nthe closed loop behaviour of the cylinder-force is used as in\nSinha et al. (2015a), with a PTO bandwidth of 6rad/s and a\ndamping factor of 0.6. The cylinder is limited to give a max-\nimum significant force of 200kN.\nCase study\nAgu\u00e7adoura wave climate scatter diagram is chosen to\nanalyse the finite depth effects on the energy resource and\ncapture. Agu\u00e7adoura located near P\u00f3voa de Varzim north\nof Porto in Portugal is an important testing and demon-\nstrating area for WECs. The Agu\u00e7adoura wave farm was\nthe world's first wave farm designed to use the three\nPelamis WECs to convert the motion of the ocean surface\nwaves into electricity. It is located 5km offshore.\nThe plotted scatter diagram shown in Figure 3 is a result\nof statistical analysis and was generated using 3-hour con-\nsecutive significant wave height and wave period time\nsequences, resulting from simulations with the Simulating\nWaves Nearshore (SWAN) model for the entire time inter-\ngrams shown in Figure 3 have been obtained for three\nm, respectively.

The sea states were structured\n \u00d7\np s\n.\nResults and discussion\nEffect of water depth on the spectrum\nThe transformation effect on the spectral shape is plotted\nin Figure 4 for peak period of 13s. It can be seen that the\npeak of the spectrum reduces with decrease in water depth.\nThe graph shows a significant reduction of sea state vari-\nance as the water depth reduces to 58 and 20m.\nEffect of water depth on significant wave height\nFigure 5 illustrates the effect of water depth on the signifi-\ncant wave height for different peak periods of the scatter dia-\ngram. The study shows that the significant wave height\nreduces as the water depth decreases and the result is normal-\nized by the deep water value Hs deep\n,\n. The significant wave\nheights are calculated using zero order spectral moments.\nEffect of water depth on the scatter diagram\nDue to water depth decrement, the sea states having the\nhighest significant wave height are less probable, and on\nthe other hand, the probability of occurrence of the sea\nFigure 2. Hydraulic PTO model.\n112 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(3)\nstates having lower heights is increased with limited water\ndepth. This is the main characteristic that stands out from\nthe three scatter diagrams as shown in Figure 3 \u00ad the\nclasses of higher significant wave height Hs\ndecrease\ntheir probability, and those of lower Hs\nincrease their\nprobability, as water depth decreases. This aspect may be\ninteresting for WECs, since usually the PTO system is lim-\nited in terms of nominal power and therefore the system\nwill not use the full wave energy power resource of the\nlargest sea states. The water depth effect on the probability\ndistribution of the significant wave heights is plotted in\nFigure 6. The probability is more concentrated around the\nlower significant wave heights between 1 and 2m.\nEffect of water depth on the wave power\nresource\nOnce the new spectral shapes are calculated, it is possible\nto compute the effect of change in water depth on the\navailable power resource. The available wave power\nFigure 3. Scatter diagram for Agu\u00e7adoura.\nresource is calculated using the expression for energy flux\nin deep water which is given by\nP\ng\ne s\n=\n\n\nwhere Te\nis the average energy period and is given by\nT\nf S f df\nS f df\nm\nm\ne\nTMA\nTMA\n=\n( )\n( )\n=\n-\n-\n\n\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that more than 50% of the\navailable wave power is lost as the water depth changes\nm depth.\nHence, there is a significant reduction in the wave power\nresource when water depth reduces. The result is quite\nsimilar to the one obtained in Folley et al. (2006).\nEffect of water depth on power absorption\nThe final step is to study the effect of water depth on the\nwave power extracted by a heaving point absorber WEC\ncoupled with a hydraulic PTO. The power matrices for dif-\nferent water depths are presented in Figure 7. The control\nparameters bPTO\nand kPTO\n, which are shown in Figures 6\nand 7, respectively, have been optimized for each sea state\nin the scatter diagram to give the corresponding maximum\nvalue of extracted power.\nFrom the power matrix in Figure 7, it can be seen that\nthere is a considerable reduction in absorbed power as we\nmove from deep to shallow water, especially for the sea\nstates with longer periods. The values in Figure 7 move\nfrom smaller green to moderate yellow and to larger red\nvalues. Also, it can be observed that the maximum\nabsorbed power is distributed around different peak peri-\nods for different water depths. This affirms the impor-\ntance of considering the scatter diagram for the correct\nwater depth when designing and fine tuning the WEC. It\nis seen from Table 2 that around 50% less wave power is\nextracted at a water depth of 20m than at 79m. This is a\nsignificant reduction in extracted power. The power\nabsorption reduces by around 7% on moving to a depth of\nThe optimized values in the bPTO\nand kPTO\nmatrices\nmove from smaller green to larger yellow values. From\nFigure 4.

In Figure 9, the values\nshown are the absolute values of kPTO\n; the actual values\nare just the negative of the ones shown in the matrix.\nThere is a considerable difference in values as we move\nfrom deep to shallow waters, especially for sea states\nwith longer periods. For the water depth of 20m, the opti-\nmal kPTO\nvalues are the highest as compared to other\nwater depths.\nFigure 7. Power matrix for different water depths.\nTable 2. Extracted wave power for different water depths.\nWater depth (m) Power absorbed (kW) % Power lost\nConclusion\nThe present study uses a simplified method to represent\nthe wave spectrum modification as the water depth reduces,\nnamely, the TMA method. Moreover, the effect on wave\npower resource as well as on the power absorbed by a\nheaving point absorber WEC is presented. Most of the\nrecently proposed WECs are planned to be installed in\nrelatively shallow water depths where the wave energy\nresource is reduced compared to deep water. This case\nstudy uses the annual wave statistics from Agu\u00e7adoura,\nlocated at north-west coast of Portugal. The scatter dia-\ngram representing the annual wave statistics modifies sig-\nnificantly as the water depth reduces from 79 to 58m and\nFigure 8. bPTO\nmatrix for different water depths.\n116 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(3)\nm.
