Although frailty predicts\nhospital readmission in patients with chronic nonpulmonary diseases, no multidimensional\nfrailty measures have been validated to stratify the risk for patients with COPD.\nAim: The aim of this study was to explore multidimensional frailty as a potential risk factor\nfor readmission due to a new exacerbation episode during the 90 days after hospitalization\nfor AE-COPD and to test whether frailty could improve the identification of patients at high\nrisk of readmission. We hypothesized that patients with moderate-to-severe frailty would be\nat greater risk for readmission within that period of follow up. A secondary aim was to test\nwhether frailty could improve the accuracy with which to discriminate patients with a high risk\nof readmission. Our investigation was part of a wider study protocol with additional aims on\nthe same study population.\nMethods: Frailty, demographics, and disease-related factors were measured prospectively\nin 102 patients during hospitalization for AE-COPD. Some of the baseline data reported\nwere collected as part of a previously study. Readmission data were obtained on the basis\nof the discharge summary from patients' electronic files by a researcher blinded to the\nmeasurements made in the previous hospitalization. The association between frailty and\nreadmission was assessed using bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression\nmodels. Whether frailty better identifies patients at high risk for readmission was evaluated by\narea under the receiver operator curve (AUC).\nResults: Severely frail patients were much more likely to be readmitted than nonfrail\npatients (45% versus 18%). After adjusting for age and relevant disease-related factors\nin a final multivariate model, severe frailty remained an independent risk factor for 90-\nhospitalizations for exacerbations in the previous year and length of stay were also significant\nin this model. Additionally, frailty improved the predictive accuracy of readmission by\nimproving the AUC.\nConclusions: Multidimensional frailty predicts the risk of early hospital readmission in\npatients hospitalized for AE-COPD. Frailty improved the accuracy of discriminating patients\nat high risk for readmission. Identifying patients with frailty for targeted interventions may\nreduce early readmission rates.\n",

A\nsecondary aim was to test whether frailty could\nimprove the accuracy with which to discriminate\npatients with a high risk of readmission. Our\ninvestigation was part of a wider study protocol\nwith additional aims to determine rate and time\ncourse of functional changes on the same study\npopulation which were already reported in a pre-\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nA prospective observational design was used.\npatients hospitalized with exacerbations of their\nCOPD were prospectively recruited from acute\nmedical wards at Morales Meseguer Universitary\nHospital, Murcia (Spain) and followed during 90\ndays after their discharge. Inclusion criteria were\na diagnosis of COPD according to the Global\nInitiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease\n(GOLD) guidelines,17 admission with a diagnosis\nof AE-COPD as determined by the specialist res-\npiratory team. Admission was defined as a medi-\ncal ward stay of greater than 24 h duration and\nAE was regarded according to GOLD defini-\ntion,17 for example, `...an acute event character-\nized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory\nsymptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day vari-\nations and leads to a change in medication.'\nPotential participants were excluded based on the\nfollowing criteria: significant cognitive deficits\n(i.e. Mini-mental State Examination score < 20),\na terminal illness (expected survival of <4\nmonths) or inability to answer self-report ques-\ntions. Some of the baseline data reported in this\narticle were collected as part of a previously pub-\nlished study.16 All participants provided written\ninformed consent. The Hospital's Ethics\nCommittee approved this study (EST-35/13).\nAll patients received a minimum 7 days of oral\ncorticosteroids, and we treated with nebulized\nbronchodilators. Antibiotics were given for pre-\nsumed infective exacerbation at the judgement of\nthe clinical team.\nMeasurements\nFrailty. Frailty was measured within 48\u00ad96 h of hos-\npital admission by means of the Reported Edmon-\nton Frail Scale (REFS).15 A research assistant with\nno formal medical training administered the REFS.\nThe REFS samples nine domains; cognition, gen-\neral health status, functional independence, social\nR Bernabeu-Mora, G Garc\u00eda-Guillam\u00f3n et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 385\nsupport, medication use, nutrition, mood, conti-\nnence and self-reported performance.The REFS is\nbased on a scale from 0 to 18, with higher scores\nentailing more severe frailty.15 Scores were catego-\nrized into four predefined categories of `Not Frail or\nVulnerable' (0\u00ad7), `Mild Frailty' (8\u00ad9), `Moderate\nhypothesized that patients with moderate-to-severe\nfrailty would be at greater risk for readmission\nwithin that period of follow up and that frailty could\nimprove the accuracy with which to discriminate\npatients with a high risk of readmission. These\nhypotheses were prespecified in the original study\nprotocol.\nHospital readmissions.Hospital readmissions for\na new AE between 30 and 90 days after hospital\ndischarge were selected (the 0\u00ad29-day interval was\nnot considered because some patients do not\nrecover completely until 4 weeks from exacerba-\ntion).18 Readmission data were obtained on the\nbasis of the discharge summary from patients'\nelectronic files by a researcher blinded to the mea-\nsurements made in the previous hospitalization.\nDemographic and disease-related variables.A\ntotal of 14 demographic and disease-related vari-\nables were selected, based on a search of the lit-\nerature as covariates based on their potential\nassociation with either the readmission following\nhospitalization for AE-COPD5\u00ad7,9 or with frailty\nincluded age (years), sex and living with partner/\nspouse (yes/no). Disease-related variables were\nclassified into three domains related to activity,\nseverity and impact of disease.20 The activity\ndomain included smoking status (being an active\nsmoker or not), history of smoking as pack years,\nnumber of hospitalizations because of exacerba-\ntions in the previous year and body mass index\n[BMI (kg/m2)]. The severity domain included\n, requiring non-invasive ventilation during\nhospitalization, length of stay in the hospital\n(days), number of comorbidities measured using\nthe Functional Comorbidity Index21 and coexis-\ntent cardiovascular comorbidity (yes/no). Finally,\nthe impact domain included the modified Medi-\ncal Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale\nand dependence. All these disease factors, except\ndependence, were acquired from electronic files\neither during hospitalization or at discharge.\nDependence was measured after 48\u00ad96 h of hos-\npital admission by means of an activities-of-daily-\nliving (ADL) scale as described elsewhere.22\nBeing unable to perform an ADL or requiring the\nhelp of another person for any ADL was self-\nreported.The score range for this scale (0\u00ad6) was\nbased on the number of dependencies, with a\nscore of 6 representing dependencies in all ADLs.\nData analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize\nparticipant characteristics. We used analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) or Kruskal Wallis to examine\ndifferences in baseline characteristics with respect\nto the ranges of frailty. For comparing categorical\ncharacteristics between readmitted and not read-\nmitted patients, we used Pearson 2 or Fisher's\nexact test if numbers were low. Between-group\ndifferences were assessed using the independent t\ntest or Mann\u00adWhitney U tests (if non-normally\ndistributed data) for continuous variables.\nA univariate logistic regression and a trend analy-\nsis were used to assess the association between\nfrailty and readmission within 90 days after hospi-\ntalization. Additionally, two separate multivariate\nmodels were first fit for demographics and\ndomains related to activity, severity and impact of\ndisease by including those in each domain that\nshowed a statistically significant association (p <\n0.15) as independent variables in previous binary\nanalyses with either readmission or frailty. The\nfirst model (Model 1) contained frailty as well as\ndemographics and variables concerning activity\ndomains of disease. Model 2 contained frailty and\nvariables concerning severity and impact domains.\nA final multivariate logistic regression model was\nchosen by including the most strongly predictive\nfactors from each of the individual models. All\nmultivariate models were produced using the\nbackwards stepwise method and variables\nremained in the model if p < 0.10. Goodness-of-\nfit and regression diagnostics for the models were\nassessed using methods described elsewhere.23\nThe interaction between frailty and those varia-\nbles that remained in the final model (age, length\nof stay and number of exacerbations) were con-\nsidered in that final model; however, no modifica-\ntions were found and therefore subgroup analyses\nwere not performed.\nTwo methods were used to assess and quantify\nwhether frailty could improve the accuracy of the\nability to discriminate patients with early read-\nmission. First, we constructed receiver-operating\ncharacteristic (ROC) curves with the predicted\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(10)\n386 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\nprobabilities from the final multivariate model,\nwith and without frailty, and calculated their area\nunder the curve (AUC). We used the overall dif-\nference between the two AUCs to determine\nwhether frailty added discriminative value.\nSecond, we selected the best cut-off points of\neach ROC and calculated the sensitivity (Se),\nspecificity (Sp), positive (LR+) and negative\n(LR-) likelihood ratios. Cut-off points were\ndefined as the value at which Se + Sp - 1 was\nmaximized.\nNo a priori sample size calculation was done for\nthese specific analyses, beyond that performed in\nthe original study protocol, which was based on\nthe rule of thumb that 15 subjects per predictor\nare needed for a reliable equation in multiple\nregression models.24 All analyses were performed\nwith the SPSS statistical software program (SPSS\nversion 19.0; IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, US).\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nOf the 107 patients hospitalized with COPD\nexacerbations, four were excluded because they\npatients were included at baseline. After 90 days\nparticipated in the study; one participant with\nsevere frailty died. At baseline, we had only five\n(4.85%) missing values in the variable smoking\nhistory by pack years and three (2.91%) missing\nfor dyspnoea.\nBaseline characteristics of patients as a whole,\nand stratified by subgroups of frailty are shown in\nTable 1. The mean [standard deviation (SD)] age\nof the total sample was 71.0 (9.1) years. The sam-\nple was predominantly male and evenly split\nbetween patients living or not with a partner/\nspouse. A total of 34% were still smoking. The\nmore frequent comorbidities were diabetes\ngastrointestinal disease (20%).

Participants with moder-\nate-to-severe frailty at hospital admission had\nsignificantly more exacerbations in the previous\nyear, higher comorbidity burden, worse respira-\ntory disability (MRC), and a higher number of\ndependencies (Table 1). No significant differ-\nences nor correlation were found between frailty\ngroups and severity by FEV1\n(data not showed).\nFrailty and readmission\nmitted for AE within 90 days of hospital discharge.\nBaseline characteristics of those readmitted and\nnot readmitted within 90 days are compared in\nTable 2.

The AUC\nwas higher with the addition of frailty (0.831 ver-\nsus 0.782) to the three demographic and disease-\nrelated factors included in the final model (Table\n3), implying that frailty adds value as a predic-\ntive factor.\nThe cut-off scores yielded the most accurate dis-\ncrimination of patients with high readmission\nrisk, which were 24% for the full model and 27%\nfor the model without frailty. Frailty also improved\nthe accuracy of classifying patients using these\noptimal cut-off points. The sensitivity, specificity,\nand likelihood ratios calculated for these cut-off\npoints are shown in Table 4.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we aimed to minimize possible con-\nfounders between frailty and readmissions by\ncontrolling for key demographic and disease-\nrelated factors. Frailty was a relevant and inde-\npendent risk factor for readmission within 90\ndays following hospitalization because of AE in\npatients with COPD, even after accounting for\nrisk factors.

Our\nstudy extends these findings, showing that a mul-\ntidimensional model of frailty is also a predictor\nof readmissions.\nIn this study, we explored together the relative\nimportance of frailty and multiple known factors\nrelated to readmission. We used multivariate\nanalysis to control covariates of the frailty index.\nMoreover, only the factors with statistically sig-\nnificant contributions concerning both the expo-\nsure (frailty status) and the outcome measure\n(readmission) were entered and combined. The\ndisease-related factors, number of hospitaliza-\ntions because of exacerbations in the previous\nyear and length of stay and age were consistently\nassociated with readmission. Therefore, it seems\nreasonable to conclude that the occurrence of\nreadmission within 90 days after hospital dis-\ncharge is a complex and multifactorial process\nmediated by both the patients' disease-related\nstatus and their frailty. Surprisingly, other known\ndisease-related factors (e.g. smoking status,\nrequiring non-invasive ventilation, cardiovascular\ncomorbidity, and functional dependence) did not\ndifferentiate themselves as predictors of readmis-\nsion, which is somewhat contrary to the published\nliterature.5\u00ad9 A possible reason explaining these\nfindings is that these variables were added to the\nmodels, along with other factors that were rela-\ntively more significant to readmissions.\nTable 3.

However, our study highlights\nthat frailty adds value to well-known disease-\nrelated factors in the accuracy for predicting read-\nmissions. This is a valuable finding that supports\nincluding the measurement of REFS in the clini-\ncal setting, where it may be useful to have a meas-\nure of frailty but where there may not be time to\nperform a performance-based test (i.e. gait speed)\nor when patients are unable to perform these tests\n(i.e. walk 5 meters independently).\nThe real value of the findings on frailty presented\nhere is that it provides a strategy for targeting\ninterventions aimed at patients in most need (i.e.\nfrail patients) and to reduce readmission rates.\nBecause frailty is potentially reversible by pulmo-\nnary rehabilitation in patients with lung disease,27\ntargeting frail hospitalized patients with a high\nrisk of readmission might be a determinant\nfor preventing readmissions. Table 4 provides\ninformation needed to estimate the probability\nthat a patient having a specific age, length of stay,\nnumber of hospitalizations and frailty level will be\nreadmitted within 90 days after hospital dis-\ncharge. However, in our opinion, there may be a\nlarger benefit in implementing readmission pre-\nvention programs in patients with COPD and\nmoderate-to-severe frailty living in the commu-\nnity rather than only in hospitalized patients.\nSimple, combined interventions such as nutri-\ntional, physical, and cognitive training were effec-\ntiveinreversingfrailtyamongcommunity-dwelling\nOur study has several limitations.

Data on\npostacute rehabilitation services were lacking.\nNevertheless, we know that rehabilitation services\nwere not widely used by the patients as reported in\nother studies.28 Second, patients with cognitive\ndeficits may be frailer and their exclusion may bias\nthe results. Our decision to exclude them was\nbased on the fact that self-reporting measures are\nlimited amongst these individuals. Third, it may\nbe speculated that other factors not included in\nthe final model could improve it (e.g. having a\nclose follow-up visit, postdischarge treatment,\npsychosocial factors, hypercapnia, Long term\nFigure 2.
