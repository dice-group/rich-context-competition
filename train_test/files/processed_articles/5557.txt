LV dilatation and remod-\nelling starts immediately after AMI and is defined as\nchanges in both infarcted and non-infarcted regions of the\nventricle, leading to impaired contractile function, ventric-\nular dilatation and heart failure.1,2\nPrevious studies demonstrated relations between the\noccurrence of LV remodelling after AMI and pre-existing\nhypertension, size of an infarct area, revascularization of\nthe culprit artery, anterior location of the infarct, neurohu-\nmoral activation, including the sympathetic, beta-adrener-\ngic and renin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS).3\u00ad7 The effect of\nthrombolysis or early interventional revascularization of\nthe infarct artery, -blockade and angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) inhibition in the acute phase after AMI and\nin the chronic phase of consequent development of heart\nfailure due to LV remodelling are widely discussed.\nLeft ventricular remodelling after acute\nmyocardial infarction: Impact of clinical,\nechocardiographic parameters and\npolymorphism of angiotensinogen gene\nDiana Zaliaduonyte-Peksiene\u00b9, Sandrita Simonyte2,\nVaiva Lesauskaite\u00b2, Jolanta Vaskelyte1,2, Olivija Gustiene1,\nVaida Mizariene1, Renaldas Jurkevicius1, Giedre Jariene2,\nAbdonas Tamosiunas2 and Remigijus Zaliunas1\n Keywords\nAngiotensinogen, polymorphism, infarction, remodelling\n1Department of Cardiology, Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of\nHealth Sciences, Lithuania\n\u00b2Institute of Cardiology, Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of\nHealth Sciences, Lithuania\nCorresponding author:\nDiana Zaliaduonyte-Peksiene, Department of Cardiology, Medical\nAcademy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Eiveniu 2, Kaunas,\nEmail: diana.peksiene@gmail.com\nOriginal Article\nZaliaduonyte-Peksiene et al. 287\nHowever, significant heterogeneity exists in the pharmaco-\nlogical benefits of the standard treatment and prognostic\noutcomes to individual subjects.8,9 Because of that, great\nattention has been devoted to the evaluation of genetic vari-\nation of certain enzymatic systems, as a potential risk factor\nin the development of LV remodelling. RAS plays a central\nrole in arterial blood pressure regulation and pathophysiol-\nogy of heart failure and many of the key proven pharmaco-\ntherapies based on RAS enzymatic inhibition are used in\npatients with acute coronary syndromes and heart\nAngiotensinogen (AGT) is discussed as one of the\npotential components of RAS to have a significant role in\nLV remodelling and heart failure development.11 AGT is a\nliver protein and is the substrate of renin.12 The reaction\nbetween renin and AGT starts an enzymatic cascade that\ngenerates the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is later con-\nverted to angiotensin II by ACE and chymase. The human\nAGT gene consists of five exons and four introns and is\nlocated in the chromosome 1q42\u00ad43.

The mean age\ndefined according to the standard criteria based on clinical\nsymptoms, ECG findings and cardiac enzyme abnormali-\nties.15 Exclusion criteria were as follows: prior myocardial\ninfarction; arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation; inade-\nquate two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic images for\nanalysis; contraindication to coronary angiography/inter-\nvention (including renal failure, bleeding tendency, shock\nstatus, severe anaemia). Family history, cardiovascular risk\nfactors and current treatment were obtained from each\npatient using a standard questionnaire. Hypertension was\ndefined as the presence of elevated systolic (>140 mmHg)\nand/or diastolic (>90 mmHg) blood pressure or the current\nuse of antihypertensive drugs. A patient was considered as\na smoker if he was smoking at the current moment or was a\nsmoker in the past. Diabetes mellitus was identified when\ndietary treatment and/or medical therapy was required to\ncontrol blood glucose levels. Hypercholesterolaemia was\ndefined as serum total cholesterol levels of 5.2 mmol/l or\nmore, low density cholesterol more than 2.6 mmol/l, and\ntriglycerides equal or more than 1.7 mmol/l or use of statin\nAll the patients were invited for the follow-up visit at a\nfour-month period and underwent a repeated echocardio-\ngraphic examination. Data of 141 patients matching criteria\nof the study design were further evaluated.\nReference group genotypes were used for the compari-\nson with the genotypes of the AMI population. The refer-\nence group (N=1010) consisted of a random sample of\nKaunas population patients, taken from the epidemiologi-\ncal HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial Factors In\nEastern Europe) study, free from symptoms of ischaemic\nheart disease (IHD) and stroke.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients,\nand the study protocol was approved by the ethics commit-\ntee of the hospital.\nEchocardiography\nAll AMI subjects were examined using 2D echocardiogra-\nphy within 48\u00ad72 hours after the symptoms of AMI.\nPatients were imaged in the left lateral decubitus position\nusing a commercially available system (Vivid Seven,\nGeneral Electric-Vingmed, Milwaukee, WI, USA).\nStandard images were obtained using a 3.5-MHz trans-\nducer, at a depth of 16 cm in the parasternal (long- and\nshort-axis images) and apical (two-, three- and four-cham-\nber images) views. Standard 2D and colour Doppler data,\ntriggered to the QRS complex, were saved in a cine-loop\nformat. Measurements were averaged from at least three\nconsecutive beats. At baseline, 2D echocardiography was\nused to assess conventional parameters such as LV end-\nsystolic diameter (LVESD), LV end-diastolic diameter\n(LVEDD), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV end-dias-\ntolic volume (LVEDV), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), wall\nmotion score index (WMSI), the mitral inflow peak early\nvelocity (E)/mitral annular peak early velocity (E'), or E/E'\nratio. 2D speckle-tracking imaging analysis for evaluation\nof deformation parameters (strain) was also performed. At\nfour-month follow-up, 2D echocardiography was made\nrepeatedly to reassess LV volumes and LVEF. The LV vol-\numes (end-systolic and end-diastolic) and LVEF were cal-\nculated from the conventional apical two- and four-chamber\nimages, using the biplane Simpson's technique.17 All other\nechocardiographic dimensions, severity of mitral regurgita-\ntion, assessment of regional contraction and evaluation, and\nlongitudinal strain of LV assessed by speckle-tracking\nimaging were evaluated as described previously.18\n288 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(3)\nLV remodelling was defined as a 20% increase in LV\nend-diastolic volume (LVEDV) at four-month follow-up\ncompared with the baseline, respectively.19\nGenetic analysis\nGenomic DNA was extracted from 3 ml EDTA venous\nblood samples (white blood cells) using a commercial\nDNA isolation kit \u00ad Sorpoclean Genomic DNA Extraction\nModule kit (Sorpo Diagnostics, Vilnius, Lithuania) \u00ad\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of\npurified DNA were stored at \u00ad20\u00b0C until use in real time-\nPCR analysis. Subjects were genotyped for AGT gene\nM235T polymorphism. Samples were genotyped with\nTaqMan allelic discrimination Assay-By-Design (Applied\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Cycling conditions\nwere preceded by a denaturing step at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, fol-\nlowed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, anneal-\ning at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Allele-specific fluorescence was\nthen analysed on an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection\nSystem with SDS v. 2.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was carried out using Software\nPackage for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nContinuous variables were expressed as means \u00b1\nstandard deviations (SDs) when normally distributed,\nand as medians (25th, 75th percentiles) when not nor-\nmally distributed. Continuous variables were assessed\nusing the unpaired Student's t test and Mann\u00adWhitney U\ntest, as appropriate. Categorical variables are presented\nas absolute numbers and percentages and are compared\nusing the 2 test. Differences in echocardiographic vari-\nables (baseline vs. four months) were assessed by paired\nStudent's t test. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were\nanalysed with the 2 test. In order to predict LV remodel-\nling in an individual patient, clinical, echocardiographic\nand genetic variables were put into logistic regression\nanalysis. Variables with statistical significance at uni-\nvariable analysis were further analysed at multivariable\nanalysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nFeasibility\nA total of 182 consecutive AMI patients matching the\ninclusion criteria were screened initially. Eight subjects\ndid not complete the follow-up because of their decision\nnot to participate in the repeated evaluation. One AMI\npatient died during a four-month follow-up (non-cardiac\ncause of death) and seven patients were withdrawn from\nthe study because of the recurrent symptoms of angina/\ninfarction with following percutaneous coronary interven-\ntion percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Twenty-six\npatients (14.3%) with poor quality echocardiographic\nimages were excluded from the further evaluation after the\nfirst echocardiographic evaluation.\nClinical and echocardiographic patient\ncharacteristics\nAt follow-up, 49 patients (34.7%) were classified as having\nLV remodelling. Age, gender, time from AMI symptoms to\nrevascularization, body surface area, ischaemic heart disease\nrisk factors, use of medications at follow-up, and number of\ninvolved coronary arteries showed no significant differences\nbetween the two groups (Table 1). Patients with LV remodel-\nling were more frequently prone to anterior wall MI (p<0.01),\nhigher leucocyte count value at admission (p<0.01), lower\nWMSI (p<0.01) at the acute episode of MI. Parameters of\nmyocardial deformation such as global systolic longitudinal\nstrain of LV and global systolic longitudinal strain rate of LV\nwere lower at baseline in AMI patients who developed LV\nremodelling at follow-up. There were no differences between\nthe groups in mitral regurgitation (MR) grade or E/E' ratio.\nFrequencies of AGT gene genotypes\nAGT genotype and allele frequency distribution of LV\nremodelling and non-LV remodelling groups were accord-\ning to the Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium (p>0.05).\nThe frequencies of the genotypes of AGT gene from the\nstudied AMI population are presented in Table 2. Patients\nwith LV remodelling significantly more often were carriers\nof the MM genotype when compared with non-LV remod-\nelling group patients (p=0.02). When genotype frequencies\nwere compared between AMI patients and reference group\npatients, patients from the non-LV remodelling group more\nrarely were carriers of the MM genotype (p=0.0005), while\nLV remodelling group patients have not shown any signifi-\ncant differences in genotypes compared with the general\npopulation.\nAt follow-up, patients with MM genotype had larger\npatients with the TM or TT genotype (Table 3).

Patho\nphysiologically, AGT is one of the key components of\nRAS, playing an important role in the RAS enzymatic cas-\ncade.13 AGT is converted by renin into angiotensin I and\nfurther cleaved to angiotensin II by ACE. Accordingly,\nAGT and AGT gene polymorphism become important\ndeterminants of angiotensin II level in both serum and tis-\nsues and have crucial effects in the remodelling process\nafter AMI. It is possible that carriers of the particular geno-\ntype of AGT M235T gene may have different levels of cir-\nculating AGT or different pathophysiological effects on the\nvessels, tissues, enzymatic reactions or other pathophysio-\nlogical processes. The results of our study showed associa-\ntions between the genetic polymorphism of AGT and\npost-infarct remodelling. Impairment of the echocardio-\ngraphic parameters such as LV end-systolic and end-dias-\ntolic volumes and LVEF at follow-up in carriers of MM\ngenotype suggested a hypothesis of the genetic background\non LV remodelling progression after myocardial infarction.\nIn previous studies, the impact of T allele of AGT M235T\non the etiopathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases has been\nmuch discussed. However, data from the different studies\nrevealed some disagreement. In several meta-analyses, the\nTT genotype was associated with increased risk for hyper-\ntension;12,13,26 in a few studies an association between AGT\ngene polymorphism and LV remodelling and hypertrophy\nin healthy subjects, mainly athletes,27 dialysis patients28\nand hypertensive patients was demonstrated.29 Although\nsome authors have found the T allele to be a risk factor for\nMI or severity of coronary heart disease,11,30,31 others found\nno association.7 Sekuri et al. showed that the risk of\npremature coronary heart disease in subjects with the AGT\nMM genotype was significantly higher when compared\nwith individuals not carrying the M allele.32 Similar results\nwere published by Fern\u00e1ndez-Arc\u00e1s et al., where M allele\nwas reported as an independent risk factor for MI.33 In the\nanalysis of our results of genotype distribution between the\nLV remodelling group and non-LV remodelling group, MM\ngenotype demonstrated predominance in the LV remodel-\nling group, suggesting that patients with MM genotype\nhave a higher susceptibility to LV remodelling after AMI.\nFurthermore, the echocardiographic parameters of the\ngroup with MM genotype also demonstrated the dilatation\nof LV and impairment of systolic function of LV at follow-\nup. Interestingly, combined analysis of the general popula-\ntion and AMI patients' genotypes demonstrated that\nprevalence of MM genotype is the same in the overall pop-\nulation and patients with LV remodelling, and T allele is\nsignificantly rare in patients with LV remodelling; T allele\nis much more common in patients without LV remodelling.\nThis suggests that T allele may have a protective role in LV\nremodelling etiopathogenesis and unfavourable LV remod-\nelling is seen less in carriers of T allele. Regarding our data,\nat least in the patient population with AMI the possibility of\nM235T polymorphism of AGT as an additional risk factor\nfor the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes could not\nbe excluded.\nThe importance of localization of the infarct and the\nincrease of the inflammatory markers at the onset of AMI\non the LV remodelling development have been described in\nour previous study18 and are supported by some other\nauthors.34,35 The present study also revealed a predictive\nvalue of anterior wall infarction and increased count of leu-\ncocytes while troponin I and C-reactive protein did not\nreveal statistical significance. Anterior localization of AMI\ncontributing to the larger size of infarction involving apical\nsegments of the LV has been demonstrated to be a signifi-\ncant predictor of worse outcome after AMI.4,35,36 Despite\nthe increase in white blood cell count, C-reactive protein,\ncardiac necrosis markers, which have been demonstrated as\npredictors of ventricular remodelling, and also the other\nserum markers such as BNP, tenascin, and homocysteine\nhave been demonstrated to have a role in post-infarct\nremodelling,34-38 although these markers have not been\nevaluated in our study.\nThe early initial evaluation of systolic function of the LV\nis very important in post-infarct LV dysfunction assessment\nand is a marker in the further prognosis statement after\nAMI.39 Furthermore, the diagnosis of ventricular remodel-\nling is mainly based on the echocardiographic evaluation at\nfollow-up. Our results revealed that initial decrease of\nLVEF and enlarged end-systolic volume may predict LV\nremodelling.
