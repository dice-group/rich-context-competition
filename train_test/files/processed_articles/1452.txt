They recommend treatment based on history\nof hip or vertebral fracture, hip and spine bone mineral\ndensity (BMD) T-scores, and--among those with low\nbone mass--an elevated 10-year risk of fracture estimated\nfrom the World Health Organization (WHO) risk index\n(FRAX).(2)\nJ\nJBMR\nAddress correspondence to: Meghan G Donaldson, PhD, San Francisco Coordinating Center, California Pacific Medical Center, 185 Berry Street, Suite 5700, Lobby 5,\nSan Francisco, CA 94107, USA. E-mail: mdonaldson@sfcc-cpmc.net\n\u00df 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\nTwo approaches to treatment may be considered: one based\non BMD alone and the other based on absolute risk of fracture.\nAlthough BMD is a strong predictor of hip and nonvertebral\nfractures in men,(3) over three-quarters of all fractures occur in\nmen without WHO BMD-defined osteoporosis.(4) Thus treatment\nthat is initiated based on BMD alone will not treat a large pro-\nportion of men who eventually go on to fracture. In general,\ncompared with treatment based on BMD alone, the emphasis on\ntreating based on absolute risk of fracture will decrease the\nproportion of 50- to 60-year-old men who are treated with drugs\nbecause they have a low risk of fractures. On the other hand,\nthis approach may result in treating a large proportion of older\npeople, particularly older white men who have a higher absolute\nrisk of fracture. The proportions of various age groups that would\nbe treated under the new NOF guidelines are not known. We\npreviously estimated the proportion of older white women who\nparticipated in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures that would be\ntreated under the new NOF guidelines,(5) and we aim to extend\nthese findings to men. Therefore, we used data from the Osteo-\nporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) and applied the new\nNOF treatment guidelines to estimate the proportion of white\nmen aged 65 years and older who would be recommended for\npharmacologic treatment. MrOS is a community-based sample of\nmen from six communities. To confirm how well MrOS represents\nthe US white male population aged 65 years and older, we\ncompared the MrOS population with white males aged 65 years\nand older who participated in the third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) on treatment criteria\nlisted in the NOF guidelines (including FRAX) common to both\ncohorts. This was done to gauge the similarities of the two\ncohorts on treatment criteria and to assess the generalizability of\nthe proportion that would be recommended for treatment in the\nUS white male population compared with MrOS. Since NHANES\nIII was missing several components required to calculate FRAX, it\nwas not possible to directly compare the proportion recom-\nmended for treatment between the NHANES III cohort and the\nMrOS cohort.\nMethods\nWe used data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study\n(MrOS), a prospective study of community-dwelling men aged\n65 years and older recruited from six communities in the United\nStates: Birmingham, Alabama, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Palo Alto,\nCalifornia, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, Portland, Oregon, and San\nDiego, California.(6,7) Participants were recruited from popula-\nMen were not recruited on the basis of any risk factors for\nosteoporosis. All participants provided informed consent. This\nstudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each of\nthe participating sites.\nDemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and medical\nhistory\nMen provided information regarding fracture history, smoking\nstatus, alcohol consumption, parental hip fracture history, rheu-\nmatoid arthritis, and corticosteroid use. All prescription medica-\ntions recorded by the clinics were stored in an electronic\nmedications inventory database (San Francisco Coordinating\nCenter, San Francisco, CA, USA). Each medication was matched to\nits ingredient(s) based on the Iowa Drug Information Service\n(IDIS) Drug Vocabulary (College of Pharmacy, University of Iowa,\nIowa City, IA, USA).\nHeight was measured with a wall-mounted Harpenden\nstadiometer (Holtain, Ltd., DyFed, United Kingdom). Weight\nwas measured with a balance-beam scale, except for one of the\nclinical centers that used a digital scale (Portland). Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by\nheight in meters squared.\nBone mineral density\nBone mineral density (BMD) was obtained at the proximal femur\nand lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)\nusing QDR 4500 densitometers (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). T-\nscores for the femoral neck (FN) and total hip were calculated\nbased on the means and standard deviations for men obtained\nfrom the NHANES III.(8) T-scores for the spine were calculated using\nthe reference value provided by the manufacturer.\nWHO 10-year absolute fracture risk\nThe WHO 10-year absolute risk of both hip fracture and major\nosteoporotic fracture (ie, hip, clinical spine, forearm, or shoulder)\nwas calculated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Metabolic\nBone Disease in February 2009. Calculation of absolute risk was\ndone following the FRAX algorithm.(2,9) FRAX is described in\ndetail elsewhere. Briefly, the calculation of the 10-year pro-\nbabilities is based on nine risk factors (ie, age, sex, BMI, previous\nhistory of fracture, parental history of hip fracture, current\nsmoking, use of corticosteroids in past 3 months, presence of\nrheumatoid arthritis, and three or more alcoholic beverages\nper day). The 10-year probabilities for both hip and major\nTable 1. Criteria for Recommending Pharmacologic Treatment from the US NOF Guidelines\nIn women and men aged 50 years and older, pharmacologic therapy should be recommended for those with any one of the following:\n A history of hip fracture or clinical or radiographic spine fracture\n T-score of \u00c02.5 or less at femoral neck or spinea\n Low bone mass (osteopenia), T-scores of \u00c01.0 to \u00c02.5 at the femoral neck or lumbar spine and any of the following:\n !3% 10-year probability of hip fracture or\n !20% 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture based on the WHO model for the United States\naAfter excluding secondary causes.\nosteoporotic fracture can be calculated with or without FN BMD.\nThe NOF treatment guidelines use the 10-year absolute risks (of\nhip and major osteoporotic fractures) calculated using FN BMD.\nNHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the health\nand nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.\nThe survey uses a stratified complex sampling strategy to identify\nand examine a nationally representative sample of approxi-\nmately 5000 persons each year. We used data from white men\naged 65 years and older who participated in NHANES III. A direct\nestimation of the proportion of white men aged 65 years and\nolder who would be recommended for treatment under the\nNOF guidelines cannot be performed using NHANES III because\nlumbar spine BMD, paternal history of fracture, and personal\nhistory of fracture at skeletal sites other than the hip, spine,\nand wrist were not assessed in NHANES III. For those factors in\nFRAX and/or the NOF guidelines that were measured in both\nMrOS and NHANES III, we reported the mean values for conti-\nnuous variables (ie, age, BMI, and BMD) and proportions for\ndichotomous variables (ie, personal history of fracture, maternal\nhistory of fracture, rheumatoid arthritis, current smoking, and\nconsumption of three or more alcoholic drinks per day). NHANES\nIII data were obtained from the publicly available data release\n(www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). Means and proportions were\nadjusted for the NHANES III sampling strategy, as recommended\nin the NHANES analysis guidelines, using the SURVEYMEANS\nand SURVEYFREQ procedures in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC,\nAnalysis\nMen in MrOS were excluded from the analysis if they were\nnonwhite. Although MrOS and NHANES III enrolled nonwhite\nmen and FRAX probabilities can be calculated for several\ndifferent ethnicities, the analysis was limited to white men\nbecause there were too few nonwhite men in the MrOS cohort to\nprovide an accurate ethnicity-stratified analysis. Men also were\nexcluded if they had missing data for any of the factors required\nto apply the NOF guidelines, including those required to cal-\nculate FRAX. We applied the NOF guidelines as given in Table 1 to\ndetermine the proportion of men who would be recommended\nfor treatment.\nRadiographic vertebral fracture status was not available in\nMrOS. However, this information is not collected routinely in the\nusual care setting, and therefore, in order to conservatively apply\nthe guidelines, we did not include information about radio-\ngraphic vertebral fractures in determining whether a man should\nbe treated.\nIn the primary analysis, the criterion ``past history of hip fracture\nor clinical or radiographic vertebral fracture'' was conservatively\nlimited to past history of hip fracture. We also estimated the\nproportion of men who would be recommended for treatment if a\nhistory of clinical vertebral fractures was included. In other\nsecondary analyses, we applied the criterion ``T-score of \u00c02.5 or\nless at femoral neck or spine'' and ``osteopenia and 10-year risk of\nhip fracture of 3% ot greater or osteopenia and major osteoporotic\nfracture risk of 20% or greater'' alone. Finally, to determine if the\nproportion of men who would be recommended for treatment\ndiffered by age, we analyzed men 65 years of age and older and 75\nyears of age and older.\nResults\nA total of 5995 men participated in the baseline examination. Of\nhad complete data for the nine clinical risk factors in FRAX and\nfemoral neck BMD. The two most common reasons for missing\ndata were parental history of hip fracture and glucocorticoid use\n(n \u00bc 1438). An additional 11 men were missing one or more of\nthe other FRAX variables. Finally, 26 men were missing spine\nBMD (an element of the NOF guidelines). Thus 3887 men were\nincluded in the analysis. Men who were missing at least one FRAX\nor NOF criteria had similar age, BMI, and femoral neck BMD to\nthose included in the analysis.\nMen in MrOS were slightly older (73.6 versus 72.2 years) and\nhad slightly higher BMD values at the femoral neck than men\n65 years of age and older who participated in NHANES III.\nTherefore, men in MrOS had a lower prevalence of T-scores\nbelow \u00c02.5 and a higher number with T-scores above \u00c01.0.\nSimilar proportions of men in MrOS and NHANES reported a\nprevious hip fracture compared with the men in NHANES (1.3%).\nA smaller proportion of men in MrOS reported consuming of\nthree or more alcoholic beverages per day, and current smoking\ncompared with that in NHANES (Table 2). The prevalence of\nbisphosphonate use among men in MrOS was 1.8%.\nOverall, applying the modified NOF guidelines to men aged\n65 years and older in MrOS, 33.4% would be recommended for\ntreatment (Table 3). When history of clinical vertebral fracture is\nincluded, 34.0% of men would be recommended for treatment.\nWhen the guidelines are applied to men aged 75 years and older,\n49.1% would be recommended for treatment.\nApplying only the NOF guideline criterion of ``T-score of \u00c02.5 or\nless at the femoral neck or spine,'' 7.0% of men would be\nrecommended for drug treatment (Table 3). However, if T-score of\n\u00c02.5 or less is limited to only the femoral neck, 5.0% would be\nrecommended for treatment (Table 3). Applying only theNOF\nguideline criterion ``low bone mass and 10-year risk of hip fracture of\n3% or greater or major osteoporotic fracture risk of 20% or greater,''\n29.2% of men would be recommended for drug treatment.\nDiscussion\nWe estimate that application of the new NOF guidelines\nwould result in recommending that pharmacologic treatment to\nprevent fractures should be initiated for about one-third of the\nparticipants in the MrOS study and approximately half the men\nover age 75. These figures may underestimate the proportions\nthat would be recommended for treatment in the US population\nbecause the men in MrOS had somewhat higher BMD values\nthan the men in the US population-based NHANES III survey.\nFurthermore, we did not include some criteria for treatment,\nsuch as a history or presence of a radiographic vertebral fracture,\ninclusion of which would further increase the number recom-\nmended for treatment.\n1508 Journal of Bone and Mineral Research DONALDSON ET AL.\nOur estimates are consistent with results from the Canadian\nMulticenter Osteoporosis Study (CaMOS). In our study, we found\nthat approximately 8% of men would be eligible for treatment\nusing only the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture\nof 20% or greater criterion. A similar analysis in the CaMOS cohort\nfound that over 10% of white men aged 65 years or older would\nhave a 10-year probability of fracture of 20% or greater based on\nBMD and the risk factors used in the WHO model.(10) Although\nthe NOF cost-effectiveness analysis did not report the proportion\nof men who would be treated under the NOF guidelines, they do\nconclude that pharmacologic treatment would be cost-effective\nfor the average 73-year-old white man.(11) Thus, given that the\nmedian age of men who participated in MrOS was 73 years, it is\nconsistent that we estimated that a high proportion (34%) of\nmen would be recommended for drug treatment.\nOur analysis suggests that approximately one-third of the\nolder white men recommended for pharmacologic treatment\nunder the new guidelines would be included because they have\nlow bone mass (osteopenia) at one of the two skeletal sites and a\n10-year estimated probability of hip fracture of 3% or greater or a\n10-year estimated probability of major osteoporotic fracture of\n20% or greater. The FRAX probability of hip fracture risk (!3%)\nwas the criterion that would lead to the greatest number of men\nbeing treated (29% of total group). When so many people and\nsuch a large proportion of older men are recommended for drug\ntreatment, it is important that the assumptions underlying the\nTable 2.

In particular, it is\nimportant that there be strong evidence of substantial benefit\nfrom treatment among those with low bone mass and additional\nrisk factors. To date, there have been no randomized, controlled\ntrials testing the efficacy of antifracture drug treatment in this\npopulation.\nWe found that about 5% of men in MrOS had osteoporosis,\ndefined as a femoral neck BMD T-score of \u00c02.5 or less. A recent\nsystematic review indicated that there were limited data to indicate\nthat treatment was effective in reducing fractures in men.(12)\nSpecifically, there have been two trials testing the efficacy of\nhormone(17,18) in men with osteoporosis. All studies demonstrated a\nsignificant increase in lumbar spine BMD, the primary endpoint, and\nthree studies demonstrated a significant reduction in incident\nvertebral fractures(13\u00ad15) on active drug compared with placebo.\nHowever, the efficacy of these drugs to prevent both vertebral and,\nin particular, nonvertebral fractures remains unclear.\nOur estimates have several limitations. First, MrOS is a cohort\nof community-dwelling volunteers and not a population-based\nsample. However, characteristics of the MrOS participants are\nsimilar to, or healthier than, those of the population-based\nNHANES III, and therefore may underestimate the proportion\nof men who would be recommended for treatment. Secondly,\nFRAX may underestimate the 10-year probability of major\nosteoporotic fracture among those who have a radiographic\nvertebral fracture. We conservatively excluded radiographic\nvertebral fractures when the FRAX 10-year probabilities were\ncalculated by the WHO (i.e., radiographic vertebral fractures\nwere not included as a ``history of previous fracture'' in the\nFRAX calculations). Finally, as this analysis from MrOS includes\nonly white men age 65 or older this study is not able to estimate\nthe proportion of younger men or men of other racial groups\nwho would be recommended for pharmacologic treatment.\nPresumably, the proportion of people in these groups recom-\nmended for treated will be substantially less than the estimates\nfrom MrOS because they have a lower risk of fracture and lower\nprevalence of osteoporosis.\nWe conclude that the new NOF guidelines for pharmacologic\ntreatment for osteoporosis would recommend drug therapy to at\nleast one-third of white men aged 65 years and older and 50% of\nthose older than 75 years of age. When such a large proportion of\nolder men is recommended to receive drug treatment for\nosteoporosis, it is important that the assumptions that underlie\nthat analysis be based on robust evidence. This would require a\ntrial of bisphosphonate therapy and/or other pharmaceutical\nagents in women and men with just ``low bone mass.''\nDisclosures\nJTS has received research support from Eli Lilly & Company.
