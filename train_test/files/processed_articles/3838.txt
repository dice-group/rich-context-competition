Drawn from Foucault's panopticism,\nthe author examines how discipline operates as a controlling power in several Korean institutions of schools, the seminary,\nand the military.This autobiographical self-reflexive research explores disciplinary images of \"Korean-ness,\" which has been\ndiscursively and materially constructed and embodied via panoptic technologies.These counter-narratives do not support\nfor the advancement of the universalized version of the \"Korean\" identity. Rather, the author theorizes Korean identity\nas discursive practices in modern power structures, while dealing with the \"political `double bind'\" of (a) individualization\nthrough instruments of discipline and (b) the reinforcement of Confucian ideal of proper human relationships.This article\nprovides educators with a lens to examine the ways in which disciplinary power/knowledge operates to control students'\nways of thinking,behaving,and living,in relation to\"self,\"\"others,\" and institutions.By opening possibilities to examine cultural\nidentity beyond discovering \"true\" self, the author emphasizes the analyses of power in its examination of cultural sameness/\ndifference in multicultural curriculum studies.\n",

One period per week, Mr. Yi1, our Sino-Korean\nteacher, taught us not only Classic Chinese characters but\nalso the values embedded in each one.\nMr. Yi: In-Ui-Ye-Ji-Sin ()!\nStudents: In-Ui-Ye-Ji-Sin ()!\nMr. Yi: Benevolence In, righteousness Ui, propriety\nYe, wisdom Ji, sincerity Sin!\nStudents: Benevolence In, righteousness Ui, propriety\nYe, wisdom Ji, sincerity Sin!\nI recall his passion for explaining the meaning of\neach word, as well as his basic knowledge about Confucian\nteaching.\nMr. Yi: OK, class. Benevolence In. This character is\nthe combination of \"human\" () and \"two\" ().\nWhen two people live together, they have to be\nbenevolent, generous, and kind to each other. This\nis the most important lesson that Confucius taught.\nRepeat after me, Benevolence In!\nStudents: Benevolence In!\nMr. Yi explicated the meaning and etymology of the word\nwhile writing the character on the blackboard. Then he asked\nus to repeat, while memorizing the meaning and pronuncia-\ntion at the same time.\nMr. Yi: Righteousness Ui!\nStudents: Righteousness Ui!\nMr. Yi: Sometimes, you guys say to each other, \"We\nshould keep our Ui-ri (loyalty, )\" or \"You are\nsuch a disloyal guy.\" When do you say this?\nStudent A: When my friend is loyal to me, he has\nUi-ri. If my friend betrays me for his selfishness, he\nbecomes a disloyal friend.\nMr. Yi: That's correct. Righteousness Ui is similar in\nmeaning to Ui-ri. Ui means righteousness, faithful-\nness, loyalty, and justice. Confucius taught people\nto move beyond their own personal interests, and\nimmediate benefit to a community's interest and the\nlong-term benefit of a society.\n1Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSeungho Moon, Oklahoma State University, 239 Willard Hall, OSU,\nEmail: seungho.moon@okstate.edu\nDisciplinary Images of \"Korean-Ness\":\nAutobiographical Interrogations\non the Panopticon\nSeungho Moon1\n Keywords\npanopticism, Confucianism, diversity in curriculum, autobiographical inquiry\n2 SAGE Open\nWhen Mr. Yi explained the meaning of Ui, he provided\nfamiliar examples for us. Keeping Ui-ri among students was\nimportant because disloyalty to a peer group or other kinds\nof groups is a way to be ostracized in the community. From\nthis familiar concept, Mr. Yi introduced what Confucius\nemphasized in his teaching.\nMr. Yi: Propriety Ye!\nStudents: Propriety Ye!\nMr.Yi:As you should know, Ye is habits of mind to con-\nsider other people's situations and reserve yourself.\nFrom ancient times, Koreans are called courteous\npeople in the East. We should keep this wonderful\ntradition. Guided by the Confucian teaching of Ye,\nwe should respect elders, be humble, and be consid-\nerate to others. Please remember to be a courteous\nand humble person. This is a way of success. Imag-\nine rice farming. The more rice ripens, the more\nrice stalks are bent with grain. Like these ripening\nrice stalks, a really knowledgeable person does not\nshow off his or her knowledge. They are always\ncourteous, humble, and polite.\nMr. Yi emphasized Ye in his teaching because it governs\nall relations in Confucianism. Without Ye, a person is\nscarcely civilized (Park, 2006). Mr. Yi's metaphor of ripened\nrice stalks was the most widely circulated metaphor among\nmy teachers, who emphasized the importance of becoming\ncourteous and humble. For the rest of the class, he addressed\ntwo other basic principles of Confucianism, Ji and Sin. He\nunderscored the value of Ji, which emphasizes learning and\nsharing knowledge with other colleagues, and Sin, which\nvalues trust and sincerity among people, especially friends.\nIntroduction\nConfucian teaching predominantly takes a major role in intro-\nducing Korean culture or the \"Korean-ness,\" including\nConfucius's emphasis on strong interpersonal relationship and\nharmony, hierarchical social interactions, and high value on\nEducation Fever is a term to introduce Korea's educational\nphenomenon that highly values education (e.g., entering a\nprestigious university) for keeping and/or promoting social\nstatus grounded in Confucianism (C. J. Lee, 2005; J. Lee,\n2006). Daily practices of Confucianism become a tool to\nexplicate cultural difference between Korean and other cultures\nMy inquiry in this article begins from the question, \"When\nteachers' understandings about cultural sameness/difference\nare normalized with the use of predetermined identity (e.g.,\nConfucianism-based culture), what different approaches might\nbe possible for the research in cultural identity?\" In other words,\n\"What discourses do I create in the field of multicultural curricu-\nlum studies when Korean-ness is essentialized with the use of\nConfucian teaching, without explications of discursive practices\nin education?\" While responding to these questions, this article\npurports to generate \"complicated conversations\" (Pinar,\nReynolds, Slattery, & Taubman, 1995) to imagine diverse\napproaches to identity, culture, and education. When research\non/about/of cultural sameness/difference is essentialized in\nunderstanding culture, educators might lose great opportunities\nto examine the complexity and ambiguity regarding identity.\nI explore possibilities to extend identity research while\nchallenging the \"discovery\" of preexisting self, as is the domi-\nnant current educational discourse and its practice. Drawing\nfrom the frame of power/knowledge (Foucault, 1980), I\nattempt to extend the notions of discursive constructions of the\nsubject and culture into the field of multicultural curriculum\nstudies. As I mentioned earlier, I problematize predominant\ncultural determinations in terms of normalizing cultural same-\nness/difference. Such elaboration with the frame of panoptic\ntechnologies is a necessary effort to examine complicatedness\nof subjectivity and discursive aspects of cultural identity.\nThus, cultural sameness/difference can be applied in the\ninquiry into \"what possibilities of mobilization are produced\"\nfrom the current, existing discursive configurations (Butler,\nAmong many approaches to identity research, I mainly\ninterrogate disciplinary strategies that have circulated and\nbeen employed during my upbringing. Most notably, I exam-\nine how my \"Korean-ness\" has been discursively constructed\nand embodied in modern power structures, while dealing\nwith the \"political `double bind'\" of (a) instruments of the\npanoptic technologies (i.e., individualization techniques)\nand (b) the reinforcement of Confucian ideal of proper\nan attempt to examine the complexity of identity and culture\nthat cannot be explained by the \"Korean\" culture without the\nWhen I examine discipline in this study, I predominantly\nborrow Foucault's (1977) concept of biopower that makes\n\"possible the meticulous control of the operations of the body\"\n(p. 137). In this inquiry on disciplinary images of Korean-\nness--which is fluid and not essentialized--power/knowledge\nbecomes a theoretical lens to examine disciplinary power.\nAccording to Foucault, power/knowledge is an \"inseparable\nconfiguration of ideas and practices that constitute a discourse\"\n(Ball, 1990, p. 5), and no power relation exists without the\ncorrelative constitution of knowledge and discourse. Multiple\npower relations exist that constitute the social body, and the\nnexus of power cannot be implemented without the operation\nFoucault (1972) conceptualizes discourses not merely as\ngroups of signs but as \"practices that systematically form the\nobjects of which they speak\" (p. 49). Power resides in the\ndiscursive formation, and it is through discourses that power\nis exercised everywhere and always circulating in daily edu-\ncational practices (Moon, 2011b). Discourses construct\nsocial meanings of self/other, cultural sameness/difference,\nand diversity via power/knowledge in terms of (a) who can\nsay, (b) what can be thought/spoken, and (c) when, in what\ncircumstances, and with what authority they are spoken and\ncirculated (Jabal & Riviere, 2007). Drawing from the power/\nknowledge nexus (Foucault, 1980), I mainly examine the\nways in which knowledge is produced and produces subjec-\ntivity with the control of body and mind to optimize docility\nand productivity, that is, panoptic technologies.\nIn Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Foucault\n(1977) conceptualizes disciplinary power through panoptic\ntechnologies with the emphasis on invisibility of surveillance\nand self-control. The panopticon is a modern architectural\nnetwork--not a fixed structure--in which invisible power\noperates in a multifaceted, fluid, and porous collection of\nnetworks. The panoptic technology, which is \"an exemplary\ntechnology for disciplinary power\" (Dreyfus & Rabinow,\nIn this article, I examine the instrument of discipline and pan-\noptic technologies. This interrogation explicates the ways in\nwhich \"discipline\" functions as the controlling power therein\nand thus constructed my identities. Overall, panoptic technol-\nogies guide me to examine how the subject is discursively,\nsocially, and physically constructed as the effect of power/\nknowledge.\nWith the use of self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry--as\na mode of genre and inquiry--I narrate my interpretations of\nexperiences in Korean school, the seminary, and the military.\nI examine how disciplinary power actually operates by the\npanoptic technology, and theorize these narratives guided by\nthe instruments of discipline. I do not introduce my narratives\nwith the purpose of generating a monolithic version of Korean\nidentity. My interpretations of my experiences in Korea--that\nis always provisional and political--become a launch pad\nto explicate the ways in which power/knowledge operates in\nseveral Korean institutions, including schools. Foucault\n(1983) mentions, \"The analysis of power relations cannot\nbe reduced to the study of . . . institutions\" in that \"power rela-\ntions are rooted in the system of social network\" (p. 224). The\npurpose of this study is not merely examining power relations\nwithin several Korean institutions, including the seminary,\nmilitary, and schools. Rather, I examine possibilities to review\nidentity and culture beyond discovering preexisting self/other\nby examining social networks and disciplinary technologies.\nUltimately, this study interrogates the (im)possibilities of\nconducing identity research \"differently\" as a political engage-\nment, that is, to recognize students who are not following the\nnormalized understandings of cultural sameness/difference.\nA Self-Reflexive Autobiographical Inquiry\nWith a use of self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry, I\nintend to interrupt methodologies that I draw from con-\nstructivist and phenomenological narrative research.\nThese interruptions of conventional narrative research\ntradition (Clandinin & Connelly, 2004)\u00admostly grounded\nin ethnographic studies--aim (a) to generate alternative\nresearch methods in self-reflexive autobiographical\ninquiry as well as (b) to pry open a space to continue\nconversations about what it means to collect data and\nanalyze it poststructurally in research practices.\nMy definition of self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry is\ninfluenced by Pillow's (2003) reflexivity of discomfort, which\nchallenges the humanistic usage of self-reflection grounded\nin the recognition of \"authentic\" self, others, and the truth,\nand strives toward a discomforting and interruptive method-\nology. So, when I refer to self-reflexive autobiographical\ninquiry, I mean the constant troubling, examination, and dis-\nmantling of the autobiographical subject's comfort by the use\nof reflexivity to investigate discursively, sociopolitically, cul-\nturally, and historically constructed identities, truths, and\nrealities. In other words, I do not posit that I can and will\ndiscover my Korean identity that is applicable to other\nKoreans. I do not intend to analyze a normalized version of\nConfucianism to introduce the Korean identity or Korean-\nness. Rather, I investigate sociopolitical, cultural, and histori-\ncal contexts wherein the subject is discursively constructed\nand embodied within power/knowledge (Foucault, 1980),\nthat is, knowledge gets produced and produces the subjectivity.\nPillow (2003) begins her theorization of reflexivity of\ndiscomfort from challenging the conventional qualitative\nself-reflective research. Namely, postpositivistic qualitative\nresearch seeks to (a) understand self, (b) understand the\nother, (c) discover the \"existing\" truth, and (d) transcend\nthese understandings of self, the other, and truth as well as\n\"one's web of situated positionality\" (Ilter, 1994, p. 63, as\ncited in Pillow, 2003). Pillow interrupts this humanistic\nmodel of reflection by positing a reflexivity of discomfort.\nShe mentions possibilities of critique beyond a certain kind\nof universalized reflexivity, concluding that uncomfortable\nreflexivity is about engaging researchers in people's struggles--\nstruggles that are often caused by monolithic representations\nof self/other, truth, and reality. Pillow asserts that the use\nof \"uncomfortable reflexive practices\" (p. 175) possibly\naddresses \"messy,\" complicated, discursively constructed\nrealities, identities, and memories.\nAs such, Pillow (2003) coins self-reflexivity of dis-\ncomfort for ethnographic studies. By employing this\nmethodology, she attempts to dismantle humanistic under-\nstandings of self, others, truth, and reality that are waiting\nout there to be discovered. She also troubles any concept\nof the \"knowing\" researcher with the use of reflexivity of\ndiscomfort. This research is, quite obviously, not an ethno-\ngraphicstudythattypicallyworkswithresearchparticipant(s).\nIn this self-reflexivity autobiographical inquiry, I, however,\nstrategically use self-reflexivity as a means of moving\nbeyond the \"comfort\" of discovering my predetermined\nKorean experience, reality, memory, and identity. I concen-\ntrate on the \"discomfort\" of investigating complexities of\nthem. With the use of some important methodological impli-\ncations from self-reflexivity, I was able, with limits, of\n4 SAGE Open\ncourse, to make myself unfamiliar to challenge my\nassumptions and taken-for-grantedness about Korean cul-\nture. When grand narratives explicate Confucianism as\nsociocultural, philosophical, and ideological foundations in\nKorea, I intend to generate counter-narratives to challenge a\nnormalized version of Korean culture or Korean-ness.\nBoth as the researcher and the researched in this study, I\nnarrated my interpretation of experiences--which have\nbeen discursively constructed--by applying reflexivity of\ndiscomfort as a means of an exploration of my subjectivity\nin the making (Miller, 2005). My interest was neither recol-\nlecting the authentic account of what \"really happened\" in\nmy life nor in chronologically listing my life history as an\nobject that was transparent, linear, and waiting \"out there\"\nto be \"discovered\" and represented. In this autobiographical\nwork, I investigated how my national, ethnic, and cultural\nidentities have been discursively and socially constructed as\na means to constantly trouble, challenge, and dismantle my\ncomfort of reflexivity. Self-reflexivity of discomfort became\na tool to investigate the autobiographical self, other, truth,\nand reality beyond fixed, monolithic, and predetermined\nrepresentations.\nI use and question three data sources for this study: (a)\nmemory writing, (b) artifacts, and (c) my self-reflexive\nresearch journals. Data collection and data analysis are not\nmutually exclusive but intricately connected during my\nNarrative analysis (Riessman, 2008) comprises a major mode\nof data analysis. Challenging yet also partly applying\nRiessman's (2008) methods, I categorize narrative analysis\nusing two different genres: written texts and visual texts. I par-\ntially use this data analysis method because it expands the\nboundaries of narrative data (otherwise limited to written\ntexts) to include visual documents. Riessman's analytic tools\nallow me to analyze multiple data from memory writing,\nvisual and written artifacts, and self-reflexive journal entries. I\nalso connect data culled from my self-reflexive autobiographi-\ncal inquiry with narrative data from ethnographic research tra-\nditions, because both share similarities in terms of written and\nvisual narrative format of the data. I still challenge Riessman's\nnarrative analysis because of its constructivist approach to\ndata, which seeks to find, construct, and reorganize meanings\nthat exist within or could be retrieved from the narrative data.\nPersuaded by Smith and Watson's (2000) theorization of\nmemory, experience, identity, embodiment, and agency\u00ad\u00adall\nof which are the constitutive processes of autobiographical\nsubjectivity\u00ad\u00adI partially implement Riessman's analytic tool\nto interrogate discursively, culturally, and sociopolitically con-\nstructed meanings in my data.\nThe Panopticon and Discipline\nIn this section, I examine the efficient nature of disciplinary\npower that is operating via panoptic technology. Panopticism\nis an architectural network of a modern prison to make\nvisibility as invisible to maximize controlling people\n(Foucault, 1977). I use this multifaceted, in flux, and porous\nnetwork of panopticism to investigate principles that disci-\nplinary power operates in the institutions of monastery,\nbarracks, and schools that have directly influenced my\nidentity constructions.\nI investigate my firsthand \"experiences\" at schools, the\nseminary, and the military, exploring how relationships\namong people are constructed in Korea. When I mention\nexperience in this article, I mainly rely on Scott's (1992)\ntheory of experience. Scott theorizes the \"discursive nature\nof experience\" (p. 37) as well as the political aspects of its\nconstruction. Influenced by Scott, I define experience as\ninterpretation that is contested and political within specific\nhistorical, cultural, and social contexts, rather than simply\n\"waiting to be expressed\" (p. 33) or self-evident.\nI was inspired to develop this article by a famous sen-\ntence in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison: \"Is it\nsurprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks,\nhospitals, which all resemble prisons?\" (Foucault, 1977,\np. 228). As a person who experienced at least three of these\ninstitutions in Korea, including schools, the military, and the\nseminary, I wanted to use the panopticism as an analytic tool\nto illustrate the efficient nature of disciplinary power. Most\nnotably, \"How do Confucian ideals of harmonious society\nactually operate within disciplinary powers?\" In the analy-\nsis and interpretation of my experiences in Korea, I begin\nmy narratives with some drawings of the insides of several\ninstitutions. Then, I explain Foucault's definitions of the\npanopticon and of discipline. This leads to further interroga-\ntion of my narratives in these institutions. Framed by the\nnotion of the panopticon, I examine the instruments of insti-\ntutional discipline.\nThe Panopticon: Networks of Power\nand Operations\nFoucault (1977) develops the panoptic technology based on\nBentham's architectural model of a modern prison. The con-\ncept of the design is for all (pan-) to be seen (-opticon, to\nsee). All prisoners can be seen without being able to tell\nwhether they are being watched. In this section, I juxtapose\ngeneral structures and functions of the panopticon with the\naforementioned institutions in Korea. I acknowledge that\nFoucault's panoptic technology is not a fixed structure but\nan architectural network grounded in mobility. Disciplinary\npower, which is discursive, operates in a flexible collection\nof social networks. This article begins from the elaboration\nof panoptic structures of schools, seminary, and the military\nin that structural understanding of the panopticon is a foun-\ndation of panoptic technology.\nGeneral architectural network. According to Foucault\n(1977), the panopticon is the architectural network where\nvisibility becomes \"invisible,\" that is, a supervisor can see\nthe inmates, but the inmates cannot see the supervisor. At the\nperiphery is a ring-shaped building. A tower stands at the\ncenter pierced with wide windows that open onto the inner\nside of the circle. The peripheral building is divided into\ncells. Each of cells has two windows: one inside, correspond-\ning to the windows of the tower, and one outside, which\nallows the light to cross the cell from one end to the other.\nIn the panopticon, a supervisor in a central tower observes\nan inmate, a patient, a condemned man, a worker, or a stu-\ndent in each cell, thanks to the backlighting effect. These\npeople do not know when they are being observed by the\nsupervisor. They are alone, perfectly individualized, and\nconstantly visible. In short, (in)visibility is a \"trap\" of disci-\npline and surveillance. In disciplinary regimes in the panop-\nticon, external observers are not needed. Ultimately, knowing\nthat they are \"watched,\" the inmates watch, judge, and shame\npanopticon is a discipline mechanism that advances the exer-\ncise of power by making the space more effective in terms\nof controlling inmates, workers, students, seminarians,\nsoldiers, and patients in the institutions.\nPanopticons in Korea. While reading Foucault's (1977)\nDiscipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison, I interpreted my\nmemories and my experiences as a student/teacher, seminar-\nian, and soldier. My illustrations in Figure 1 have depicted\nthe insides of those buildings, drawn from my memories.\nDrawing these buildings on a copy of the \"Plan of the\nPanopticon,\" I realized it was not easy to tell which drawing\nmatched which institution. The drawings in Figure 1 have\nsimilarities in architectural design: a hallway in the middle, a\nwide-open space, and imperative visibility. In the middle of\nFigure 1. Inside of the Korean panopticons\nNote:Added to Discipline and Punish:The Birth of the Prison (Foucault, 1977) by Seungho Moon.\n6 SAGE Open\nFigure 1 is the inside of Nae-mu-bahn (a military barrack)\nwhere more than 50 privates slept together with no separate\nliving space. Every activity happened here except our regular\nwe were in different offices. In Nae-mu-bahn, we slept,\nwatched TV, cleaned rifles, ironed our uniforms, and some-\ntimes read books together. There was no privacy; everyone\ncould see what his or her comrades were doing almost at\nall times.\nThe school building where I studied and taught has been\nrepresented in the bottom part of Figure 1. I have shown how\nfive to six classrooms were connected on the right side of the\nhallway. The upper parts of the wall were windows. Anyone\nfrom outside the classroom could see inside, but students in\nthe classroom could not see whether someone was watching\nthem or not. I recollect that the principal walked the hallways\nquite often. We did not know whether he passed by, but we\nknew that he could always see what we were doing in class.\nAt the top of Figure 1, there are several rooms in my sem-\ninary. The space was organized to facilitate community life.\nFrom freshman year to junior year, I had approximately 12\nroommates; we slept communally, shared bathrooms, and\nstudied together. I had one roommate during senior year. If I\nhad wanted a single room, I would have had to wait until I\nwas ordained as a deacon. There were very few moments\nwhen I could be physically by myself; someone was always\nwith me. Priests lived at the room at the end of the hall. The\npriest in my hallway did not officially supervise seminarians,\nbut we encountered each other often and casually chatted\nabout what was happening in our spiritual, personal, and aca-\ndemic lives.\nNarratives: Living in the Panopticon\nI have drawn the inside of three institutions using one point\nperspective sketch--a drawing technique in which multiple\nlines converge on one vanishing point (Figure 1). Drawn\nfrom the structure, I chronologically narrate some of my\nexperiences inside the school, the seminary, and the military\npanopticon. Brief explanation of Korean context helps\nunderstand my narratives below. My school district was a\nchoice and merit-based system for high school. Every stu-\ndent in my school district can choose any school he or she\nwants to attend. A major risk of this \"choice\" is that an\napplicant should prove his or her academic capacity with test\nscores. I was lucky enough to enter the best high school in\nmy district. After high school, I decided to pursue Catholic\npriesthood and went to a diocesan seminary in my province.\nI studied theology and philosophy for 4 years. As part of\nadmission process, I went through in-depth psychological\nand physical health tests, let alone passing College Scholastic\nAptitude Test (CSAT). Unlike these choices to enter high\nschool and a seminary, South Korea has a compulsory mili-\ntary service system for healthy males. I was expected to\nserve 26 months to fulfill this obligation as a healthy Korean\nmale citizen. The following describes my experiences in\nthese institutions.\nThe schooling panopticon. Today I am so nervous again,\neven though this \"ritual\" happens at least once or twice a\nmonth. My homeroom teacher, Mr. Hwang, brings all stu-\ndents' report cards from last month's mock CSAT. As a 12th\ngrader, I should be accustomed to receiving test results, to\nsay nothing of taking tests--I have taken countless tests\nsince elementary school. Finally, Mr. Hwang walks into\nclass with a handful of documents. He calls our names, and\nwe each take our report card like a pseudo-death sentence.\nWhy a pseudo-death sentence? This document indicates\nwhere the future of my life will be. This report card deter-\nmines which college I can apply to with my current test\ntest takers in Korea. As the final ritual, Mr. Hwang posts a\npaper on the bulletin board. I know what it is a list of the top\n20 students in school. Usually, a test prep company provides\na big chart so that each student can pinpoint where his or her\nscore is located. For example, some CSAT preparation insti-\ntutions make a chart indicating which college each student\ncan apply to after taking CSAT. In this chart, the far left\ncolumn is divided into subgroups based on the test scores.\nEach major in every college is listed within this big chart.\nThe higher scores I have, the more choices I acquire in\nchoosing both universities and majors. Not only school-\nteachers but also parents refer to this chart to measure which\ncollege and major would be the \"best\" choice, considering a\nstudent's current test score. This is the way in which friends,\nteachers, parents, and I read this chart. Usually, the left two\ncolumns in the chart indicate the minimum test scores\nthat are supposedly required to apply to a certain major in a\nuniversity. The first row contains the names of all 4-year col-\nleges and universities in Korea. From the second row, a test\ntaker should find a major that matches his or her test scores.\nAs such, I situate myself within this ready-made, scien-\ntific, measurable guideline. My total test score positions my\nideal college, even my major. There is only one right answer\nin my multiple-choice tests, and hence only one right option\nfor college, based on my CSAT scores. Listing students'\nscores is not limited to the classroom bulletin board. I know\nthat teachers can see all 12th graders' monthly or semi-\nmonthly mock CSAT scores in the teachers' lounge. The\nidentities and names of all 820 seniors in my school are\nlisted as a chart. Total test scores are divided by each subject\nmatter, and every teacher can compare students' scores by\nsubject matter as well as by the total scores (i.e., 320 points).\nFurthermore, a student's ranking in the school as well as\nhis or her percentiles among all the test takers in the nation\nindicate where each student is located within the normalized\nscales. Every test is documented in this manner, and teach-\ners can observe each student's progress or regress. I do\nnot know which teachers care about my test scores, but it is\npossible that somebody is watching me all the time, without\nmy noticing.\nAt the end of the day, Mr. Lee, the vice principal, is not\nhappy with our school's test scores. He announces that our\nschool ranks second among all the high schools in the nation.\nHe really seemed to want us to be the top and the best high\nschool in Korea. He encourages us to study harder and to\nhelp each other more. He reminds me of Ms. Kang, one of\nmy homeroom teachers from middle school, who pushed our\nclass to study harder while collaborating with peers to\nbecome the top class out of 10 in monthly tests.\nHowever, I do not know how to negotiate between helping\nmy friends and raising my test scores. My friends' higher test\nscores mean that mine will get a lower Nae-shin score\u00ad\u00adwhich\nis a normalized grade point average (GPA) used to assess aca-\ndemic achievements. Nae-shin score is a college entrance\nexamination category recalculated by percentage. If I am\nlocated within the top 3%, I get a perfect score. If I am located\nwithin the top 5% or 10%, two points or four points are\ndeducted, respectively. Because of this system, I should beat\nmy friends. All the students in school are anxious because a\nlower GPA fails to guarantee entrance to a desirable college.\nAll my classmates become potential enemies as well as\nfriends. Conflicted, I do not know how much to collaborate\nwith my friends for better test scores.\nI do not like this day--not only because of the test scores\nbut also because of physical fights among classmates. The\nones with short fuses cannot keep their tempers down on this\npseudo-death sentence day. I know they pick fights for minor\noffenses such as accidentally bumping into one another. I am\nglad that another long day is finally over. Spending 7:00 a.m.\nto 11:00 p.m. in the same building is not easy, but I must\ncontinue studying to get high test scores.\nThe seminary panopticon. \"Benedicamus Domino!\" \"Deo\nGratias!\" This is the first phrase I am to shout at 6:00 a.m.\nevery day. It is the moment when I am supposed to answer\nthe invitation to \"Let us Bless the Lord\" with a response,\n\"Grace to you, God.\" I should hurry, since I must be at the\nchapel no later than 6:25 a.m. After my morning routines, I\nrun to the chapel. There is no official roll call to check\nwhether or not I attend the morning prayers. However, the\nliturgy director, sitting at the back of the chapel, knows if I\nam missing or late for the prayer. We are assigned our seats,\nand it is too easy to spot who is missing.\n6:30 a.m.: With a little bell sound, we begin pray-\ning the Officium Divinum, Liturgia Horarum (the\nLiturgy of the Hours)\u00ad\u00adwhich is the official set of\ndaily prayers. It takes almost 20 min to recite the\nprayers together.\n6:50 a.m.: This is a time for self-meditation. We do\nthe same routine in the evening, but morning hours\nare a little tough. I have to concentrate not to fall\nasleep. I remember what my spiritual director\nadvised before: Think about Peter and other disci-\nples when Jesus was praying at Gethsemane right\nbefore he was arrested and crucified. Jesus asked\nPeter and other disciples not to fall asleep but to be\nawake and pray with him. However, they fell asleep\nalthough Jesus asked the same thing twice. My\npriest's voice is reminding me of the importance of\nbeing awake all the time. I should be awake to con-\ntinue meditating and praying. My self-discipline\nis more important than being controlled by other\npeople's reminders. However, I cannot ignore the\nfact that a liturgy director and other seminarians\nmight be watching me. I also know the director\nregularly checks to see whether seminarians are\nconcentrating on meditation or falling asleep. As\nthe panopticon structure of this chapel is an open\nspace, everyone can watch what other people are\ndoing.\n7:10 a.m.: Another bell tolls. It is a sign that personal\nmeditation is over, and we need to be ready for\ndaily mass.\n7:45 a.m.: \"Ite Missa Est.\" \"Deo Gratias!\" Another\nphrase to say, \"Thanks be to God,\" at the end of\nmass. Before eating breakfast, we need to jog for\n10 minutes. I do not enjoy this exercise much, but a\nsenior priest has set the rule for seminarians'health.\n8:30 a.m.: Cleaning of rooms and other facilities.\n12:30 p.m.: Lunch. The tables in the dining hall are\nvisible from both inside and outside. As my table\nis assigned, everyone can see whether or not I am\nmissing.\nAfter optional lunch prayers, mediation, and a break, the\nafternoon schedule begins.\nthen almost an hour to be by myself without super-\nvision. I am not allowed to spend this hour in the\nsleeping room. I usually go to the chapel, library,\nclassrooms, or walk around the campus.\n5:00 p.m.: Regathering for dinner prayer.\n5:25 p.m.: Heading toward dinner.\n7:10 p.m.: The rosary, either by group or personally\n(group rosary is strongly recommended).\n7:30 p.m.: Night prayer at the chapel.\n7:50 p.m.: Night meditation. Prayers and meditation\nare much easier at night than in the morning.\n8:20 p.m.: End of meditation and going to our group\nstudy room. The Great Silence begins now and lasts\nuntil breakfast. The Great Silence is the moment\nto keep absolute silence with other seminarians\nto continue conversation with God. Chatting with\nother seminarians hinders this sacred moment.\n11:00 p.m.: \"Deo Gratias!\"Another prayer before bed,\nfalling asleep. Another long day within the Great\nSilence.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe military panopticon. It is an extremely hot day in the\nmiddle of May 1996. We are in the training field. The head\ntrainer is a lieutenant claiming that our cohort is not \"cohe-\nsive\" enough.Arm in arm forming a human chain, we do more\nthan 100 sit-ups, all the while shouting \"One--Comrades,\nTwo--I love you.\" We are all tired of these sit-ups, but I have\nto remind myself to keep my posture like a brave solider.\nOtherwise, the level of training gets harder. As a member of\nthe Republic of KoreanArmy, I should not forget that I am one\nof 1,000 comrades being trained together in the field.\nToday is the 1st day to practice using an M-16 rifle. As a\nprivate, I am expected to meet the standard by firing at least\n3 bullets out of 10 into the center of the target. This is a\npractice to establish mechanical zero on the rifle, which\nsynchronizes the M-16 with the user's body and posture.\nBefore receiving the real bullets, we practice the best\nposture for shooting, so far for more than 2 hr. Actually,\nit takes less than 2 min to shoot all the bullets. If I can meet\nthe standard on my first try, I will not be under pressure to\npractice the right posture over and over. Otherwise, I will\nhave to repeat these tedious and difficult processes until I\nget it right. Fortunately, I meet the standard after the second\ntry. During the process, my comrades shout I love you but do\nnot mean anything. I hope this day will be over soon.\nBy the end of May 2006, a total of 6 weeks of basic mili-\ntary training have passed. Now we are ready to move to\nanother military camp, where we will work for more than 2\nyears. At night, the half-moon smiles at me because I safely\nfinished the entire basic military training, including chemi-\ncal, biological, and radiological defense, 25-mile walks with\n90-pound bags, and mock-guerilla wars. We are waiting for\ntrains to transport us to our final destination. I depart from\nthe colleagues with whom I shared struggles, tears, and\nlaughs for 6 weeks.\nFinally, a train arrives and we enter the cabin. I am so\nthirsty. Drinking water is always an issue in this military. It\nis 2 a.m. Soldiers are usually shipped after midnight so they\ndo not meet citizens. In the middle of night, I become\nthirstier. I do not know who might have something to drink.\nFortunately, the guard is selling Hershey Chocolate drinks.\nI have cash with me, what I have earned over 6 weeks of\nobligations, about US$20--nothing compared with what I\ndid for the last 6 weeks. The Korean draft system mini-\nmizes payment because military service is our obligation as\nhealthy Korean male citizens.\nI am assigned to the end of the train. I really need a drink.\nSoon I am frustrated to see people ahead of me buying more\nthan three or four drinks each. Yes, this is the reality. I do not\nhave a chance to drink anything, although I have pocket\nmoney. What is the meaning of shouting I love you so much\nif we do not share basic food and drink? I feel the deep real-\nity of how selfish each individual becomes in the midst of\nhardship.\nOn the train, I do not yet realize the coming disaster\nbrought on by my entry date into service. I am called to\nservice on April Fools' Day in 1996, although in my unit\nthere are more than 20 privates who entered at the end of\nMarch in 1996. I have to respect them as \"senior\" colleagues\nsimply because they entered the military one day ahead of\nme. I use formal language to address them, although most of\nthem are 2 or 3 years younger. In the hierarchical order sys-\ntem, they are just above my rank: I am a \"junior\" colleague\nto them. The system suffocates me. I need to seek places\nwhere I can breathe.\nThe Instruments of Discipline\nLooking back on my interpretations of experiences, I wonder\nwhat discipline or set of discursively constructed social\nnorms functions in each. I am interested in what major ele-\nments exist to manage and control my behavior. What social\nnorms were internalized in my schooling, in the seminary,\nand in the military? To answer these questions, I attempt to\ntheorize my narratives using Foucault's notion of disciplinary\npower in the panopticon. In Discipline and Punish: The Birth\nof the Prison, Foucault (1977) identifies specific instruments\nof discipline used to maximize productivity by controlling\nindividuals via separation: examination, timetable, hierarchi-\ncal observations, and normalizing judgment.\nExamination. Foucault (1977) posits that examination is \"a\nnormalizing gaze, a surveillance that makes it possible to\nqualify, to classify, and to punish\" (p. 184). In the school nar-\nrative, I addressed how teachers use examination as a means\nof controlling students without being visible themselves. The\nparticipants (students) become visible by taking monthly or\nbiweekly tests, followed by documentation about each. As\nFoucault mentions, examination is the technique by which\npower holds students in the mechanism of objectification.\nTeachers and administrators neither have to show the signs of\nits potency nor need to impose their attention on students. In\nother words, teachers and administrators do not need to dem-\nonstrate their constant existence to students to control stu-\ndents' behaviors. The supervisors' invisibility through\nexamination itself makes students docile, submissive, and\ncontrollable.As such, students (the participants) are presented\nas \"objects\" to the observation of power, manifested by the\ninvisible gaze via examination.\nIn addition, the examination introduces individuality into\ndocumentation, while collecting all students' information in\nwhole piles of documents captures, fixes, and controls their\nbehaviors. Listing the top 20 students on the bulletin board or\nposting students' test scores in the teachers' lounge demon-\nstrates the power of documentation. Through it, each student\nis measured and compared. We judge ourselves and each\nother based on scores and ranks. At the same time, every stu-\ndent is normalized and classified in deciding which college to\nenter based on examination. The \"College and Major\nAssignment Chart\" classifies students based on a normalized\nscale of CSAT scores. As such, the big focus in the school pan-\nopticon lies in \"the individualized\" control via examination.\nOverall, through examination and documentation, stu-\ndents become objects to be classified, judged, and super-\nvised. Teachers do not necessarily need to show their\npresence, because students are self-disciplined to increase\ntheir productivity--in this case, to enter college.\nThe timetable. Foucault (1977) traces the origin of time-\ntables to monastic communities. In the seminary, regular\nschedules set up rhythms, assigned particular obligations\n(e.g., prayer, study, and sleep), and regulated cycles of rep-\netition. Based on the division of time, particular occupations\nand observations were controlled in detail by orders I had to\nobey promptly. In the seminary, I was to get up at 6:00 every\nmorning and go to bed at 11:00 p.m. Thanks to the timeta-\nble, every moment of time is effectively organized; wasting\nit is forbidden. Assigning the Officium Divinum, Liturgia\nHorarum regulates when and how to pray in a day: morning\nprayers at 6:30 a.m., afternoon prayers at noon, evening\nprayers at 5:00 p.m., rosary at 7:10 p.m., and night prayers\nThe rhythm imposed by the timetable is internalized and\nprogrammed within my body. The timetable becomes a norm\nthat accelerates the process of prayer, meditation, and lit-\nurgy. Internalizing the timetable enables each seminarian to\nbecome \"not only analytical and `cellular,' but also natural\nembrace the timetable into my body and thus become careful\nto acknowledge my specific daily routines. The timetable is\nembodied not only as psychic but also as muscle knowledge,\nthat is, every routine is memorized with/in my body. This\n\"docile\" body perceives and internalizes discipline, a set of\nsocial norms, and the experiences of daily lives with Jesus as\na \"good\" Roman Catholic seminarian. In this process, the\nembodied materiality of memories, both psychologically and\nphysically, functions as a natural and organic process in my\nspiritual practices in the seminary.\nHierarchical observations. Observation or gaze is the\nmajor mechanism of the panopticon. The military camp\nstructure demonstrates a power that acts by means of gen-\neral visibility. The structure of this camp, specifically\ninside, illustrates how a machinery of control is expressed\nand used as a specific observation of each private's con-\nduct. For example, Nae-mu-ban (a military barrack) is a\nplace in the camp where more than 50 soldiers live together.\nLocation of a cabinet and a bed is based on rank, decided by\nwhich month you entered the military.\nAs I explained, since I entered the military on April 1,\n1996, I am one rank lower than colleagues who entered in\nMarch 1996 and two ranks below those who entered in\nFebruary 1996. I must use formal language and show con-\nstant respect to senior colleagues, regardless of age: In Korean\nmilitary, rank beats age.\nThis month-based ranking system increases its productive\nfunction and reinforces surveillance. Technically, as I was\nrequired to serve in the military for 26 months, there would\nbe at least 25 ranks above me. Each private supervises other\ncomrades a month below. Surveillance becomes an effective\nand economical operator to reduce accidents (e.g., suicide\nor decampment) and increase the productivity of effective\nsoldiers who work systematically during a war. The power\nfunctions as a piece of machinery in this hierarchical\nsurveillance of each private (Foucault, 1977). It enables\nthe operation of relational power among soldiers, while\nsustaining the institution by its own mechanisms of surveil-\nlance and control.\nNormalizing judgment. The purpose of surveillance is to\nensure that individuals at each level of the panopticon are\nfunctioning well enough to meet the standard set up by each\ninstitution. Each individual is measured for all the values and\nexpectations promoted by the institution. Foucault (1977)\ncalls the very idea of this condition a \"norm.\" Normalizing\njudgment is used to assess behavior, value, and thought,\ngrounded in a \"natural\" or shared value in the institution. For\nexample, judgment about behavior and performance hap-\npens on the basis of the two opposite values: good/evil,\nappropriate/inappropriate, and true/false. By assessing acts\nwith a binary of normal and abnormal and of right and\nwrong, discipline judges an individual by whether or not he\nor she is \"in truth.\"\nThe major goal of discipline in the panopticon is to increase\nthe utility of each individual with respect to efficiency of time\nand cost. Each participant is invested in accepting and inter-\nnalizing the system's expectations and values. In my military\nnarrative, shooting at least 3 bullets out of 10 at the right target\nis a norm, which is a standard for a \"true\" soldier. Unless a\nsoldier meets this standard, he becomes a \"false\" soldier and\nhas to practice until he reaches it.\nSimilarly, in my school narrative, acquiring high test\nscores to enter (prestigious) colleges becomes a norm to be\nconsidered a good student for teachers. Only if a student\nenters the top 30% among the total population of seniors\nin the nations can he or she be regarded as a \"successful\"\nstudent in high school. Students who fall below the top 30%\nare considered \"failed\" students who are not \"smart\" enough\nto continue to 4-year colleges in Korea in the early 1990s.\nDistribution by rank or grade punishes or rewards: The\ninstitution sets up the norm of who will be considered a true\nsoldier depending on rifle skills in the military panopticon;\nwhen a soldier meets the norm, he is not punished by being\nordered to practice all day long. At the end of the day,\nall soldiers are reborn as true soldiers who can use a rifle\neffectively. Similarly, in the school panopticon, high school\nsenior students study the standardized tests all day to be\nincluded in the top 30%--which guarantees entrance to\n4-year colleges. All soldiers and all students become alike:\ncompetent soldiers and competent students who have met\nthe standards.\nThe instruments of discipline circulate to maximize the\nproductivity of institutions. At schools, teachers hope to gen-\nerate students who will get high Korean CSAT scores and\nenter colleges. Documenting grades and making them public\ngenerate another form of government that controls students\nwithout external physical force. At the seminary, priests can\ngenerate seminarians and future priests who are punctual,\ndisciplined, and well educated based on the embodied mate-\nriality of a tight schedule and routines. Seminarians perceive,\ninternalize, memorize, and embody this discipline as future\nchurch leaders. At military training camp, training soldiers to\nmeet the minimal requirements (e.g., using a rifle, knife, and\nhand grenade) becomes a disciplinary power to control pri-\nvates in the institution.\nDiscussion and Implication\nPeople know what they do; they frequently know why\nthey do what they do; but what they don't know is\nwhat what they do does.\n(Foucault, personal communication, as cited in\nDrawing from Foucault's panopticism and panoptic tech-\nnology, I have explored possibilities to use a different\napproach to examine identity construction. I have illustrated\nthe complicatedness of cultural identity of Korean-ness,\nwhich is discursively and politically constructed and\nembodied by the panoptic technologies. The dominant dis-\ncourse in identity research in multiculturalism focuses on\nthe discovery of \"who they are\" and \"what they do\"\ngrounded in their predetermined identity (e.g., people of\ncolor, women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender,\nor disability). My self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry\ndoes not support this humanistic approach, which general-\nizes the Korean identity by discovering \"who I am\" and\n\"what I do.\" By creating counter-narratives, which cannot\nbe applied to other Koreans, I intended to create multiple\nand complicated conversations in the field of multicultural\ncurriculum studies. Most notably, I have illustrated the\nways in which disciplinary power circulates in specific\ninstitutions in Korea. When people are not much interested\nin the examination of \"what what they do does\" (Foucault,\npersonal communication, as cited in Dreyfus & Rabinow,\npower/knowledge, that is, the undividable configuration of\nways of thinking and actual practices that constitute dis-\ncourses (Foucault, 1980). This interrogation of nexus of\npower/knowledge is a means to explore the subjectivity, or my\nKorean-ness, which is always in the making (Miller, 2005) in\na specific sociocultural, political, and economic context.\nFor example, I described tensions in modern Korean\nsociety where each institution emphasizes productivity\nthrough surveillance and discipline of each individual.\nThe ideal image of Confucianism--as it includes appro-\npriate interpersonal interaction and social harmony with\ncollaboration--generates and becomes the ideal goal that\nKorean society unanimously agrees on as a set of social\nnorms. However, these remain imaginary goals because\nthe panoptic technologies-- including separation, invisibility,\nand domination--are important strategies to produce maxi-\nmum productivity. In modern power structures in Korea,\nthese individualization techniques cause tensions with\nConfucian ideology of a harmonious community through\nbenevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and sincerity.\nWhileintroducingthefivebasicprinciplesofConfucianism,\nMr. Yi, for example, emphasized reciprocity among people as\nthe virtue of benevolence in interpersonal relationships.\nLoyalty and righteousness became important for maintaining\ngood relationships, and being polite and humble were the key\nprinciples that managed all human relationships. These prin-\nciples were embodied as a set of social norms for me as an\neducated and civilized person. The lessons from my Korean\nteachers, priests, and lieutenants guided me to value construct-\ning strong interpersonal connections among students, semi-\nnarians, and comrades.\nIn contrast, as evaluation relied on individual achievement,\nmy lieutenant's emphasis on collaboration was not meaningful\nin meeting the standards for a rifle use. Although Mr. Lee\nhoped that students would collaborate to become the best high\nschool in Korea, tensions remained between collaboration and\neach student's competitive personal motivation to get the best\nscore. In the seminary, not many opportunities were available\nto share time and ideas. Everyone was on a rigorous, individu-\nalized daily schedule. Despite these institutions' emphasis on\ncollaboration and appropriate interaction, the panoptic tech-\nnique circulates for the greatest extent possible for maximum\nproductivity. Korean subjectivity has been discursively and\nmaterially constructed in the midst of these tensions, depend-\ning on these specific sociocultural, political, economic, and\npolitical contexts.\nBy opening to possibilities beyond the use of predeter-\nmined identity, I suggest educators dismantle comfortable and\nstereotyped ways of understanding cultural difference/same-\nness. Teachers might initiate their understandings of cultural\nsameness/difference from the analysis of power/knowledge.\nConventionally, teachers ask, \"What cultural difference does a\nstudent with diverse background bring into classroom?\"\nDrawing from Foucault's panopticism, teachers might shift\ntheir questions: \"How does panoptic technology operate\nstudents' daily practices in schools, and thus, discursively\nconstruct their identities?\" The question with a \"how\" rejects\npower as a thing or a commodity but attempts a critical inter-\nrogation into the operation of power/knowledge (Foucault,\n1983). As such, an emphasis on discursively constructed\n\"subject,\" with the analysis of power/knowledge, could pos-\nsibly become a launch pad for teachers/students to inquire,\n\"What what [I] do does?\" (Foucault, personal communication,\nthis inquiry possibly explores diverse strategies that students\nor teachers use to resist various forms of disciplinary power.\nAlthough Foucault introduced the concepts to us several\ndecades ago, panopticism is timely today to examine the\nways in which power/knowledge is circulating in schools\nand other institutions. Due to the scope of this article, I do\nnot address strategies that I used to resist various forms of\ndisciplinary power. An in-depth inquiry in the notion of\nagency will be another important issue for the interroga-\ntions of disciplinary power. Overall, an analysis of disci-\nplinary power is crucial to examine discursive constructions\nas well as material and embodied enactments of the subject.\nThis project is \"not to discover what we are, but to refuse\nknowledge that controls students' ways of thinking, behav-\ning, and living. Such a \"different\" approach to identity, cul-\nture, and diversity, drawing from the analysis of power\nregime, is an attempt to dismantle the autobiographical\nsubject's comfort--comfort that categorize identity within\nfixed, predetermined, and seamless boxes (e.g., Asian,\nKorean, male, middle class). Ultimately, conducing iden-\ntity research differently--which is another political engage-\nment--aims to recognize all students who are not following\nthe normalized understandings of cultural sameness/\ndifference.\nAuthor's Notes\nThe article, with minor revisions, appears in dissertation research\n(Moon, 2011a).
