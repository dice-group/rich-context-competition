There are other definitions for inti-\nmacy which involve the notions of conflict resolution and\nsharing hurt feeling (Harper et al., 2000; Holley & L'Abate,\nthe context of sharing intimate experiences, which include\nfive factors: emotional, social, sexual, intellectual, and recre-\national (Harper et al., 2000). Harper and Schaalje have\nproved that intimacy is a mediator of daily stress effects on\ncouples' relationships (Harper et al., 2000).\nCommunication skills training has been extensively stud-\nied in the context of couples' relationships and interactions\n(Bellack & Hersen, 1979). Lack of proper communication\nskills has been shown to be a major issue leading to dissat-\nisfaction in couples' lives (Bellack & Hersen, 1979; Boland\nBullard, & Mudd, 1962). Communication skills have been\namong top three significant problems reported in distressed\nmarriages along with difficulties in sexual expression and\npersonality factors (Bellack & Hersen, 1979; Birchler,\n1977). Therefore, communication skills training seems to be\nan essential part of treatment programs for couples com-\nplaining of dissatisfaction in their relationships (Jacobson &\nEfficient communication is considered in forms of\nSpeaker Skills in which the term \"I\" is used to address a spe-\ncific message and Listener Skills in which a person listens to\nhis or her partner in an active dynamic form and try to make\n1Kerman University of Applied Sciences and Technology, Iran\n2Department of Counseling, Abhar Branch, Islamic Azad University,Abhar,\nIran\nCorresponding Author:\nMojtaba Amiri Majd, Department of Counseling, Abhar Branch, Islamic\nAzad University, Abhar, Iran.\nEmail: amirimajd@abhariau.ac.ir\nInvestigating the Effect of Communication\nSkills Training for Married Women on\nCouples' Intimacy and Quality of Life\nElnaz Farbod1, Mohammad Ghamari2 and Mojtaba Amiri Majd2\n Keywords\ncommunication skills, marital intimacy, marital satisfaction, quality of life\n2 SAGE Open\nthe communication more clear through positive feedbacks\n(Hahlweg, Revenstorf, & Schindler, 1984).\nBlanchard et al. (2009) have mentioned the correlation\nbetween Marriage and Relationship Education (MRE) and\ncouples' communication skills. Based on their meta-analysis\nstudy, they have suggested the invention of better methodol-\nogies to evaluate the role of MRE in improvement of com-\nmunication skills. Schilling et al. (2003) conducted a\nlongitudinal study to investigate the effects of Prevention\nand Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) on develop-\nment of distress in marital relationships. They found that\nPREP can significantly increase the positive communication\nskills in men and women. An interesting finding in this study\nwas the effect of increased positive communication skills in\nwomen which could lead to increased risk of male and female\ndistress onset whereas increased positive communication\nskills in men predicted decreased risk of marital distress\nBehavioral marital therapy (BMT) has been shown to be\nable to help couples improve their communication skills\n(Hahlweg et al., 1984). They have mentioned that lack of com-\nmunication skills is one of the main complaints in couples\nseeking BMT and they have shown that BMT has a positive\neffect in increasing communication skills in couples. Boland\nand Follingstad (1987) have comprehensively reviewed all the\nliterature related to relationship between communication skills\nand marital satisfaction, which has been addressed as a domi-\nnant and important correlation. The same sort of integrative\nreview has been done by Burleson and Denton (1997).\nIranian couples live in a transitional society moving from\nbeing traditional to modern. In such a complex transitional\nstate, couples'relationships, their quality of life and intimacy\nare affected. Problems related to communication skills in\nIranian couples have been addressed in the literature but lim-\nited knowledge is available toward communication skills in\nrelation with quality of life and intimacy of couples and also\ninterventional methods to overcome these problems (Askari\nMethod\nThe research design in this study was pre-test and post-test\nresearch design with experimental and control groups.\nSubjects were 30 married female students enrolled in the\nspring semester of 2011 in Applied Sciences and Technology\nUniversity (Tourism Unit) of Kerman in Iran and their hus-\nbands. They were randomly assigned to an experimental\ngroup (15 subjects) and a control group (15 subjects). We\nused pre-test and post-test to determine the effects of com-\nmunication skills training on intimacy and quality of life of\nthe women and their husbands.\nBagarozzi Intimacy Needs Survey Questionnaire\n(Bagarozzi, 2001) includes 41 questions and is a useful tool\nto measure total intimacy as a score. It uses eight factors for\nscoring intimacy: Emotional Intimacy, Psychological\nIntimacy, Intellectual Intimacy, Sexual Intimacy, Physical\nIntimacy, Spiritual Intimacy, Aesthetic Intimacy, and Social-\nRecreational Intimacy (Bagarozzi, 2001).\nThe psychometric properties of a quality of life scale (World\nof Life-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life\nAssessment-Brief,WHOQOL-BREF), has 26 items which\nmeasure physical health, psychological health, social relation-\nships, and environmental factors. The WHOQOL-BREF is a\nshorter version of the original instrument, which can be used in\nWe used Bagarozzi Intimacy Needs Survey Questionnaire\nand WHOQOL-BREF on all the married couples volun-\nteered for this study among which all were female students\nenrolled in the spring semester of 2011 in Applied Sciences\nand Technology University (Tourism Unit) of Kerman in\nIran. A total of 30 couples with the lowest scores were\nselected as subjects for this study.\nWomen in experimental group participated in a 12-ses-\nsion training on marital communication skills. The aim of\nthis training was to increase positive communication skills\nand diminish negative communication behaviors. The con-\ntrol group received no training. We used analysis of covari-\nance to test our hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: Communication skills training for married\nwomen increases their intimacy.\nHypothesis 2: Communication skills training for married\nwomen increases their quality of life.\nHypothesis 3: Communication skills training for married\nwomen increases their husbands' intimacy.\nHypothesis 4: Communication skills training for married\nwomen increases their husbands' quality of life.\nResults\nAfter analysis of the data obtained through pre-test and pos-\ntest, the effect of communication skills training had signifi-\ncantly (p < .01) increased women's intimacy, and Hypothesis\n1 was approved. Hypothesis 2 was approved as well and\ncommunication skills training had significantly (p < .01)\nincreased women's quality of life. Although communication\nskills training for women had not significantly increased the\nintimacy of their husbands (p > .1), it had a significant effect\non increasing the husbands' quality of life (p < .01). The\nresult is consistent with other studies done before (Askari\net al., 2012), showing the importance of communication\nskills training program in treatment of distressed couples\nseeking different sorts of therapies.\nDiscussion\nSprecher (2002) has indicated that communication is an\nessential requirement for establishing an intimate relationship\nFarbod et al. 3\nand giving rise to adaptability between couples. Effectiveness\nof communication skills training in fostering and maintaining\npositive intimate relationship between couples has been\nCommunication skills training helps couples to send their\nmessages more explicitly and hence come to a deeper under-\nstanding of one another. Systematic training of positive com-\nmunication skills to couples and at the same time practice of\ncommunication skills by couples will add positive habits into\ntheir behavioral repertoire and these habits will be used in\nconflict situation and avoid engaging in stress-induced\nbehaviors such as criticisms, blaming, and taunting.\nHrapczynski (2008) has shown that cognitive-behavioral\ntherapy can reduce negative communication patterns and\nnegative attitudes among couples, which will lead to\nincreased satisfaction.\nThe result of this study showed the positive effect of com-\nmunication skills education for married women on increas-\ning their intimacy and quality of life. Although it has been\nobserved that communication skills trainings have a gender-\ndependent pattern on affecting couples' behaviors (Schilling\net al., 2003), our results showed that communication skills\neducation to women can just increase the intimacy of their\nhusbands and not their quality of life. Schilling et al. (2003)\nhad somehow a similar observation and found that increased\npositive communication skills in women not only cannot\ndecrease the risk of male and female distress onset but also\nincreases it. The dynamics behind these observations need to\nbe studied in detail.\nNowadays in every society, family is the main source of\nsecurity for individuals. However, families encounter differ-\nent challenges and problems in modern societies. One of the\nmost common problems families face is diminished marital\nintimacy and satisfaction, which leads to decreased quality\nof life of families. Interventional programs to prevent these\nproblems are very helpful and communication skills training\nprograms for couples are good examples for interventional\nmeasures.\nAlthough the impact of communication skills training on\nintimacy, satisfaction, and quality of life of couples has been\nstudied, the contents of these trainings and mechanism to be\nused for inducing positive practice of communication skills\nvia educational and training programs need to be studied.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAskari, M., Noah, S.
