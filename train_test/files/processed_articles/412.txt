Rheumatoid arthritis; Antioxidants; Cardiovascular risk factors.\nINTRODUCTION\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common systemic,\nchronic inflammatory, autoimmune disease, is associated\nwith excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is\nnot entirely explained by traditional risk factors for car-\ndiovascular disease (CVD) (1\u00ad4). Novel risk factors for\nCVD including inflammatory biomarkers, antioxidants,\nand/or vitamins may contribute to excess CVD in persons\nwith RA.\nRA and atherosclerosis share common inflammatory\nmechanisms (5,6). There is an association between inflam-\nmatory markers and subsequent CVD in healthy subjects\n(7\u00ad10). Therefore, chronic systemic inflammation may\ncontribute to the higher incidence of CVD in persons with\nMoreover, there is a complex relationship between in-\nflammation, antioxidant vitamin status, and the risk of\nCVD. Previous reports have demonstrated inverse associ-\nations between inflammation and antioxidant serum lev-\nels, in particular carotenoids (15\u00ad17). Furthermore, in-\ntakes of antioxidant vitamins and other micronutrients or\ntheir serum concentrations, including carotenoids (18\u00ad\nhomocysteine (26\u00ad28), have been reported to be inversely\nassociated with CVD incidence and mortality.\nDr. de Pablo's work was supported by a Post Doctoral\nFellowship from the Arthritis Foundation and by the Kirk-\nland Foundation.

Thus, in the context of a chronic in-\nflammatory disease, deficiency of antioxidants and/or vi-\ntamins may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis\nin persons with RA. The objective of the present study was\nto compare novel risk factors for CVD, including inflam-\nmatory biomarkers, antioxidants and vitamins, and tradi-\ntional CVD risk factors, between subjects with RA and\nsubjects without RA in a large cross-sectional survey of the\nUS population.\nData source. Data were derived from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III).\nassess the health and nutrition of a large representative\nsample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popula-\ntion. The sampling frame was as a multistage, stratified,\nclustered survey to ensure representativeness (35,36). All\nparticipants provided informed consent. No personal\nidentifiers were included. Data including demographic\ncharacteristics, signs and symptoms of RA, traditional\nCVD risk factors, history of cardiovascular events, and\ninformation on prescription drug use were collected\nthrough an interview in the participants' homes. All inter-\nviewed persons were invited for a medical examination\nperformed by a physician at the mobile examination center\n(MEC), where blood samples were also obtained. The mus-\nculoskeletal examination was performed for subjects ages\nDemographics. Demographic information included age,\nsex, race, marital status, educational level, and poverty\nindex. The poverty index is defined as a ratio of family\nincome to the national poverty threshold, as determined\nannually by the US Census Bureau, age of the family\nreference person, and calendar year in which the family\nwas interviewed (35,36). Education was coded as the num-\nber of years of formal education completed.\nNovel risk factors for CVD. A priori, we considered\nbiomarkers including levels of antioxidants and vitamins,\ninflammatory biomarkers, and lipoproteins as novel risk\nfactors for CVD (37). We examined serum levels of anti-\noxidants/vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vita-\nmin E, -carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein/\nzeaxanthin, and lycopene), homocysteine, folate, and in-\nflammatory biomarkers (serum C-reactive protein [CRP]\nlevel, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, platelet volume,\nand hemoglobin). Serum CRP level was categorized as\nelevated (1 mg/dl) as previously defined (16). Fasting\nblood samples were tested for lipids (serum triglycerides,\ntotal cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] choles-\nterol, and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol), li-\npoproteins (lipoprotein[a], apolipoprotein A-1, apoli-\npoprotein B), and biomarkers considered as novel\npotential risk factors for CVD (37).\nTraditional risk factors for CVD and previous CVD. A\npriori, we considered smoking, diabetes, hypertension,\ndyslipidemia, family history of premature myocardial in-\nfarction (MI), obesity/body mass index (BMI), and seden-\ntary lifestyle as traditional CVD risk factors. Smoking sta-\ntus was assessed during the household interview.\nRespondents were classified as never smokers (100 cig-\narettes in their lifetime), former smokers (100 lifetime\ncigarettes, not currently smoking), and current smokers\n(100 lifetime cigarettes, currently smoking). Information\non pack-years of smoking was also recorded. Diabetes was\ndefined as a fasting plasma glucose level 126 mg/dl, the\npresence of a 2-hour glucose tolerance test result 200\nmg/dl (the 2-hour glucose tolerance test was performed\nonly among subjects ages 60\u00ad74 years not receiving insu-\nlin), or self-report of a physician diagnosis. Blood pressure\nwas measured 3 times during the home interview and 3\ntimes during the physical examination. Mean blood pres-\nsure was calculated by using all available systolic and\ndiastolic readings. Hypertension was defined as mean sys-\ntolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood\npressure 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medica-\ntions. Dyslipidemia was defined by use of medications to\ntreat hypercholesterolemia, fasting total serum cholesterol\nby self-report of high cholesterol. Framingham risk score\nwas also calculated for all subjects (38). History of stroke,\nMI, and congestive heart failure was obtained by self-\nreport of a physician diagnosis. Information on current use\nof postmenopausal hormone (PMH) and use of vitamin or\nmineral supplements was obtained by self-report. Nutrient\nintake was estimated from a 24-hour dietary recall (36).\nAlcohol consumption was determined from a food fre-\nquency questionnaire. Physical activity was based on lei-\nsure-time physical activity in the past month (39) and was\nreported in metabolic equivalent units. Sedentary lifestyle\nwas defined by denial of any leisure-time physical activity.\nAnthropometric measures such as body weight, height,\nand waist and hip circumferences were obtained from\nphysical examination. BMI was calculated as weight (in\nkg) divided by the square of height (in meters). Waist\ncircumference was measured at the level of the high point\nof the iliac crest and hip circumference was measured at\nthe level of maximum extension of the buttocks. The\nwaist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as waist circum-\nference divided by hip circumference (in cm).\nAssessment of rheumatoid arthritis. RA was defined\nbased on the 1987 American College of Rheumatology\n(ACR; formerly the American Rheumatism Association)\ncriteria for classification of RA using self-report of morning\nstiffness, objective findings of synovitis from physical ex-\namination, and positive rheumatoid factor (40). Radio-\ngraphs of the hands and wrists were obtained in all sub-\njects older than 60 years, but interpretation of the\nradiographs was not available at the time of this study.\nTherefore, 6 of the 7 ACR criteria for RA classification\nwere available.\nParticipants who met at least 3 of 6 available ACR cri-\nteria were defined as having RA as previously described\n(41\u00ad43). Briefly, a recent study identified subjects with RA\nin NHANES-III (41) by applying the \"n of k\" rule (40)\nidentifying subjects with 3 of 6 ACR criteria. Recent RA\nstudies used these methods to define RA cases in NHANES\n(42, 43). Participants who met no ACR criteria were de-\nfined as non-RA subjects. Subjects who met 1\u00ad2 ACR cri-\nteria were excluded from the analysis.\nMedication data. We assessed use of nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral corticosteroids, and\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Infor-\nmation on medication use in the last month was based on\nself-report of a prescription (41).\nStatistical analysis. Summary statistics are presented as\nthe mean  SD for continuous measures and frequencies\nfor all discrete variables. First, we compared RA subjects\nwith non-RA subjects. Second, we compared seropositive\nRA individuals with seronegative RA individuals in a\nsubset analysis. We used multivariate linear and logistic\nregression models for each novel and traditional CVD risk\nfactor, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex.\nMultiple linear regression was used to determine\nwhether the level of antioxidant micronutrients was inde-\npendently associated with RA. In addition to age, race/\nethnicity, sex, poverty index, and education, these models\nwere adjusted for known determinants of antioxidant mi-\ncronutrient levels including vitamin intake, carotenoid in-\ntake, total caloric intake, BMI, total cholesterol, HDL,\nsmoking, diabetes, PMH, and alcohol consumption. Carot-\nenoid intake was entered in the multivariate model as a\ncontinuous variable. An exploratory model further ad-\njusted for CRP level.\nMultivariate linear regression models were used to de-\ntermine whether the level of biomarkers was indepen-\ndently associated with RA. The analyses were conducted\namong subjects with complete information on each bio-\nmarker. The models were adjusted for age, race, sex, smok-\ning, diabetes, BMI, PMH, WHR, alcohol intake, previous\nCVD, poverty index, and education.\nMultivariate logistic regression was used to determine\nwhether a given traditional CVD risk factor was associated\nwith RA, adjusting for potential confounders including\nsmoking, PMH, alcohol intake, diabetes, BMI, WHR, pre-\nvious CVD, poverty index, and education. Finally, to eval-\nuate to what extent differences in physical activity or\nantiinflammatory medications explain differences be-\ntween RA and non-RA subjects, sedentary lifestyle and\nphysical activity and/or medications were entered in the\nmultivariate models.\nWe used Stata software (StataCorp, College Station, TX)\nsurvey data commands and applied NHANES-III weights\nto all analyses. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as\nstatistically significant. Formal alpha adjustments were\nRESULTS\nA total of 727 subjects were excluded.

Seropositive RA participants were more likely to be\ntaking DMARDs (P  0.03) but not NSAIDs (P  0.3) or\nsteroids (P  0.4) compared with those with seronegative\nRA.

However, these differences were not significant after\nadjustment for potential confounders. Framingham risk\nAntioxidants and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in RA 955\nscore was similar among RA and non-RA participants\n(20% versus 19%). None of the differences in smoking,\nprevious CVD, BMI, WHR, and leisure-time physical ac-\ntivity were statistically significant (Table 1).\nDISCUSSION\nAmong novel CVD risk factors, the levels of antioxidants\n-carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lyco-\npene were significantly lower in RA participants com-\npared with non-RA participants in this large population-\nbased study. These associations remained significant after\nadjustment for known and potential confounders. CRP\nlevel was significantly higher in subjects with RA. Further-\nmore, seropositive RA subjects were more likely to have a\nhigher CRP level than seronegative RA subjects. Partici-\npants with RA in NHANES-III had a similar prevalence of\ntraditional CVD risk factors and personal history of CVD\ncompared with non-RA controls.\nOur findings of lower antioxidant micronutrient levels\nin RA compared with non-RA participants may be ex-\nplained by inflammation. Several studies have demon-\nstrated inverse associations between inflammation and\nplasma concentrations of carotenoids and retinol (15\u00ad\n17). An inverse relationship between markers of inflam-\nmation and antioxidant levels has been observed among\nindividuals with RA (47). A prospective cohort study of\nwomen found an inverse association of -cryptoxanthin\nwith risk of RA (48) and a recent population-based study\nreported an inverse association between intake of\n-cryptoxanthin and risk of inflammatory polyarthritis\n(49), suggesting that intake of certain antioxidant micro-\nnutrients may be protective against the development of\nTable 1.

Adjusting for dietary nutrient intake is helpful in\nestablishing how much of the antioxidant deficit may be\nattributable to inadequate intake of antioxidants. After ad-\njusting for nutrient intake, subjects with RA still had lower\nconcentrations of antioxidants. This finding suggests that\nincreased metabolism of antioxidants probably results in\nthe reduced antioxidant concentrations found among par-\nticipants with RA.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that plasma carot-\nenoid concentrations are reflective of dietary intake (50\u00ad\n54). The magnitude of the correlation varies depending on\nthe specific carotenoid and the dietary assessment tool\n(55). Overall, there was a significant correlation between\ncarotenoid intake and carotenoid plasma levels. Lower\nplasma concentrations of the carotenoids -carotene,\n-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lycopene in RA\nsubjects compared with controls persisted after controlling\nfor age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes,\nBMI, PMH, total cholesterol, HDL, vitamin, carotenoid,\nand energy intake, suggesting that RA may cause an in-\ncreased metabolic turnover of antioxidants.\nCigarette smoking is a dose- and time-dependent risk\nfactor for RA (56). Smoking also affects the serum concen-\ntrations of antioxidant micronutrients (57). Therefore, re-\nsidual confounding by smoking is a concern. However,\nadjusting for smoking using pack-years did not alter the\nresults (data not shown).\nControlling for CRP level attenuated the difference be-\ntween the groups but results remained significant. The\ninflammatory process in RA, through the production of\nreactive oxygen species, may deplete stores of antioxi-\ndants, but we cannot rule out other causes such as de-\ncreased intake, decreased absorption, or transport of anti-\noxidant micronutrients in subjects with RA. Nevertheless,\na low antioxidant status might increase the potential for\noxidative damage. Several epidemiologic studies have\nfound inverse associations between serum carotenoid lev-\nels and CVD (18\u00ad20). The magnitude of the reduction has\nranged from only small decreases to a more than 50%\nreduction in risk (18). In addition, cohort studies of dietary\ncarotenoid intake and CVD found a lower risk of coronary\nevents in individuals consuming greater amounts of caro-\ntenoids (58,59). Plasma levels of lycopene are inversely\nrelated to risk of ischemic stroke (19), risk of MI (60), and\nrisk of atherosclerosis (61\u00ad63). In general, the epidemio-\nlogic evidence suggests that a diet rich in high carotenoid\nfoods is associated with a reduced risk of CVD. Further\nresearch should evaluate the causal pathway of the lower\ncarotenoid levels in RA and whether they account for the\nobserved increased incidence of CVD in patients with RA.\nAn inverse association between CVD risk and CVD risk\nfactors and low levels of vitamin D has been suggested\n(64\u00ad66). Low intake of vitamin D and low serum levels of\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly predictive of\nacute MI and stroke when adjusted for age, sex, smoking,\nand functional capacity in a recent study of subjects older\nin a cohort of elderly women, a greater intake of vitamin D\nhad an inverse association with incident RA (68). How-\never, we did not find differences in vitamin D concentra-\ntions between RA cases and controls.\nThe inflammatory markers CRP and fibrinogen are asso-\nciated with CVD and its severity (7,10,69), and it has been\npostulated that atherosclerosis and RA share common in-\nflammatory mechanisms (5,6). CRP level was significantly\nhigher in subjects with RA, which is expected given the\ninflammatory nature of the disease. CRP is an acute-phase\nprotein produced by the liver in response to interleukin-6.\nEvidence suggests that CRP has atherosclerosis-promoting\nTable 4.

Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that\nCRP level is a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in\npatients with RA and inflammatory polyarthritis, indepen-\ndent of disease severity (75). Therefore, chronic inflamma-\ntion in RA may lead to accelerated atherosclerosis, which\nin turn may be responsible for the higher incidence of CVD\nConventional risk factors for CVD appear to account for\napproximately 80\u00ad90% of all coronary heart disease\nevents in the general population (77,78). However, previ-\nous studies have demonstrated that RA is associated with\nexcess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is not\nentirely explained by traditional risk factors for CVD (1\u00ad\n4). A recent prospective study found that women with RA\nhad a significantly 2-fold increased risk of MI compared\nwith those without RA, adjusting for age, traditional risk\nfactors, oral glucocorticoid use, NSAID use, and intake of\nfolate, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin E supplements (2),\nsuggesting that the disease itself is responsible for in-\ncreased risk. In a recent retrospective cohort study, pa-\ntients with RA were twice as likely to experience unrec-\nognized MI and sudden deaths compared with non-RA\nsubjects. Also, patients with RA were less likely to have\nsymptoms of angina and were less likely to receive coro-\nnary artery bypass graft, suggesting that CVD manifests\ndifferently in RA (79). Patients with RA may have altered\nlipid profiles as a result of the rheumatoid inflammatory\nprocess (80); however, the adverse lipid profiles associated\nwith active RA have been shown to improve substantially\nfollowing effective treatment of RA without the use of\nlipid-lowering agents (81). In the present study, we did not\nfind altered lipid profiles in RA participants, and in con-\ntrast to previous observations of excess cardiovascular\nmorbidity in persons with RA, the prevalence of CVD in\nRA participants was similar to non-RA controls. Similarly,\nthe prevalence of traditional risk factors for CVD in sub-\njects with RA was similar to non-RA controls, in contrast\nto previous studies suggesting that patients with RA may\nhave a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors com-\npared with subjects without RA (82\u00ad87). The results are in\nagreement with the findings of a recent study of the dis-\ntribution of known CVD risk factors in women participat-\ning in the Nurses' Health Study, where most traditional\nCVD risk factors were similar between women with RA\nand controls. However, as expected, biomarkers of inflam-\nmation associated with CVD were generally elevated in\nwomen with RA (88). Advantages of our study include the\npopulation-based design, inclusion of both women and\nmen, and the evaluation of novel risk factors for CVD\nincluding antioxidant levels.\nStrengths of the present study include the weighted\nestimates that were generalizable to the US population at\nthe time of NHANES-III. In addition, this is the first pop-\nulation-based study examining the prevalence of novel\nand traditional CVD risk factors in RA. Also, the RA case\ndefinition was based on findings on physical examination\nfor ACR criteria for classification of RA based on a previ-\nously described method for case definition in NHANES-III\nThe analyses of associations between novel and tradi-\ntional CVD risk factors and RA involved multiple tests of\nsignificance. A potential limitation relates to multiple test-\ning, because multiple comparisons are associated with an\nincreased chance for a Type I error. However, the utility of\nformal adjustments for multiple comparisons in an epide-\nmiologic context has been questioned (44\u00ad46). We there-\nfore chose not to perform any formal alpha adjustments in\nthe present study, but we acknowledge the need to con-\nsider with caution the statistical significance of such asso-\nciations.\nThe definition of RA was based on objective criteria\n(40,41). However, our findings may not be generalizable to\nyounger individuals with RA because the study sample\nincluded subjects ages 60 years or older. Misclassification\nis possible because RA diagnosis was not confirmed by\nmedical record review. Indeed, the use of ACR criteria that\nrely on the presence of signs and symptoms of disease may\nlead to an underascertainment of RA cases (89,90). For\ninstance, persons with severe RA could have been missed\nbecause they were unable to attend the MEC evaluations or\nchose not to participate. Similarly, participants in a period\nof inactive, mild, or early disease may not have fulfilled a\nminimum of 3 ACR criteria for RA. We excluded partici-\npants with 1 or 2 ACR criteria from the analyses to reduce\nthis misclassification.\nSeropositivity was present in 27% of this population\nsample, suggesting that seronegative RA may be overrep-\nresented in this sample, or it may be that the case defini-\ntion captured a less severe disease with inflammatory\npolyarthritis. However, a similarly low prevalence of rheu-\nmatoid factor has been described in other recent samples\n(91\u00ad93). Moreover, given that RA joint deformity is not\npart of the ACR criteria, subjects with inactive disease at\nthe time of the examination who had joint deformity could\nhave been misclassified as controls. In a sensitivity analy-\nsis, we excluded all controls with hand deformities and\nthe results were unchanged.\nIn this large population study, the prevalence of tradi-\ntional CVD risk factors in RA cases compared with con-\ntrols was similar. Among novel CVD risk factors, CRP level\nwas significantly higher, and antioxidant levels were sig-\nnificantly lower in RA subjects compared with non-RA\nsubjects. Further research should evaluate whether antiox-\nidant differences account for the observed increased inci-\ndence of CVD in persons with RA.\n"
