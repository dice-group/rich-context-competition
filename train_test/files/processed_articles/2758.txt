How-\never, there is evidence that the attrition rate for sexual assaults reported\nto the police remains high, and that the locus of case attrition is arresting\nand charging decisions. In this paper, we analyze police and prosecutorial\ndecision-making in sexual assault cases using quantitative data on sexual\nassaults reported to the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles\nCounty Sheriff's Department in 2008. We argue that decisions made by\npolice and prosecutors should not be examined in isolation from one\nanother and that researchers who analyze arrest decisions by examining only\ncases that are formally cleared by arrest or who focus only on charging\ndecisions that follow the arrest of a suspect may be ignoring important\naspects of police and prosecutorial decision-making. This is confirmed by\nthe results of our study, which reveal that a significant proportion of cases\nin which the police appear to have probable cause to make an arrest do not\nresult in the arrest of the suspect and that a substantial number of cases\nare rejected for prosecution by the district attorney before an arrest is\nmade. Moreover, the factors that predict arrest and charging vary depend-\ning upon the way in which the outcome is operationally defined. These\nresults have a number of important policy implications for police and prose-\ncutors handling sexual assault cases.\nKeywords sexual assault case outcomes; police and prosecutor decision\nmaking\nCassia Spohn is a Foundation Professor and Director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Jus-\ntice.

Victims are\nreluctant to report crimes to the police and, when they do, are often met with\nskepticism and suspicion on the part of police and prosecutors. This results in\na substantial number of cases being unfounded, a low arrest rate, and shock-\ningly low rates of prosecution and conviction (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Spohn\nIn this paper, we analyze police and prosecutorial decision-making in sexual\nassault cases using data on sexual assaults reported to the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) in 2008.\ncerns perspective developed to explain judges' sentencing decisions (Steffens-\nmeier, Ulmer, & Kramer, 1998), we examine the effects of victim\ncharacteristics, indicators of case seriousness, and measures of evidentiary\nstrength on the decision to arrest and the decision to charge, with both deci-\nsions conceptualized in multiple ways. We contend that decisions made by\npolice and prosecutors cannot be examined in isolation from one another and\nthat researchers who analyze arrest decisions by examining only cases that are\nformally cleared by arrest or who focus only on charging decisions that follow\nthe arrest of a suspect may be ignoring important aspects of police and prose-\ncutorial decision-making. They also may be reaching misleading conclusions\nabout the factors that influence arrest and charging decisions. Our goal in this\nstudy is to disentangle these overlapping decisions and, in so doing, to illumi-\nnate the ways in which the policies and practices of these law enforcement\nagencies contribute to high rates of case attrition in sexual assault cases.\nPrior Research on Sexual Assault Case Outcomes\nThere is compelling evidence that sexual assault is a seriously underreported\ncrime. Tjaden and Thoennes (2006, p. 33), who analyzed the results of the\nNational Violence Against Women Survey, found that only 19.1 percent of\nwomen who were raped since their 18th birthday reported the crime; a similar\nsurvey in Canada found that only 6 percent of sexual assaults were reported to\nthe police (Du Mont, Miller, & Myhr, 2003). There is also evidence that victims\nof sexual assault who report the crime and are willing to cooperate with police\nand prosecutors as the case moves forward may confront criminal justice offi-\ncials who are skeptical of their allegations and who question their credibility\n(Estrich, 1987). The process begins with the police, who decide whether a\ncrime has occurred, the amount of investigative resources to devote to identi-\nfying the suspect, whether to make an arrest of an identified suspect and, if\nso, the charges to file, and whether to refer the case to the prosecutor. These\n\"gatekeeping\" (Kerstetter, 1990) decisions, which largely determine the fate\nof the case, do not necessarily produce the outcome--arrest and successful\nprosecution--that the victim expected. As Taylor (1987, p. 89) explains, \"After\ngiving a valid rape report and fully cooperating with the police, a woman may\nfind herself in the unexpected and bewildering predicament of having come to\nthe police for aid ... only to have the door slammed firmly in her face.\"\nThere is very limited research on police decision-making in sexual assault\ncases and much of the research that does exist is dated. Researchers have\nexamined the decision to unfound the charges (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Ker-\nsent the case to the prosecutor for charge evaluation (Alderden & Ullman,\nthe investigation of the crime (Alderden & Long, 2016). These studies reveal\nthat police decision-making is influenced by a combination of legal and extra-\nlegal factors. An early study (LaFree, 1981), for example, found that the deci-\nsion to arrest was affected by the victim's ability to identify the suspect, the\nvictim's willingness to prosecute, whether the victim engaged in any type of\nmisconduct at the time of the incident, the promptness of the victim's report,\nwhether the victim was assaulted by an acquaintance rather than a stranger,\nand the suspect's use of a weapon. On the other hand, the arrest decision was\nnot affected by the victim's race, whether the victim resisted, the location of\nthe incident, whether there was a witness who could corroborate the victim's\nallegations, or whether the victim was injured. These findings led LaFree\n(1981, p. 592) to conclude that the emphasis on the role played by the victim's\nbackground characteristics was \"greatly overstated\" and that \"legally relevant\nvariables were paramount.\" However, more recent research calls this conclu-\nsion into question. Bouffard (2000) found that arrest was more likely if the vic-\ntim and suspect had a prior relationship, the victim agreed to undergo a sexual\nassault exam, and the credibility/seriousness score of the crime was higher.\nAlderden and Ullman (2012) similarly found that police decision-making was\ndetermined primarily by extra-legal factors--the victim's preference for how\nthe case should be handled, discrepancies in victim statements, and victim\nresistance, while Schuller and Stewart (2000) found that police officers'\nresponses to sexual assault vignettes were affected by the intoxication and\ncredibility of the complainant.\nThe findings regarding prosecutors' charging decisions in sexual assault cases\nare very similar. This research, which is much more extensive than the\nresearch on police decision-making, reveals that although these decisions are\nstrongly influenced by legally relevant factors such as the seriousness of the\ncrime, the offender's prior criminal record, and the strength of the evidence\nvictim characteristics also play a role. Studies have documented the influence\nof the victim's age, occupation, and education (McCahill, Meyer, & Fischman,\n1979), \"risk-taking\" behavior such as hitchhiking, drinking, or using drugs\nutation of the victim (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Feldman-Summers & Lindner,\nResearch also has demonstrated that the relationship between the victim\nand the accused has a significant effect on charging decisions in sexual assault\ncases. Consistent with Black's (1976) relational distance theory, these studies\nconclude that reports of sexual assaults by strangers are less likely than\nreports of sexual assaults by acquaintances or intimate partners to be rejected\nSpohn, 2008); sexual assaults involving strangers also are more likely to result\nin police and prosecutor agreement on the severity of charges to be filed (Hol-\nleran, Beichner, & Spohn, 2010). Other studies find that different predictors\naffect charging decisions in stranger and acquaintance cases (Kingsnorth et al.,\nthat characteristics of the victim affected charging decisions only in cases\ninvolving non-strangers and that the suspect's use of a gun or knife affected\ncharging only in cases involving strangers.\nTwo studies used qualitative data to explore in more detail the reasons why\nprosecutors reject charges in sexual assault cases (Frohmann, 1991; Spohn\ncases are affected by the \"typifications of rape held by processing agents\"\n(LaFree, 1989, p. 241) plays a central role in the research conducted by Froh-\nscreening process and interviews with prosecutors to analyze explanations of\nand justifications for case rejection. Frohmann (1991) asserted that prosecu-\ntors' concerns about convictability led them to question the credibility of the\nrape victim and the veracity of her story. She found that prosecutors used\ninconsistencies in the vicitm's story, incongruities between the victim's\naccount and prosecutors' beliefs about \"typical\" rapes, and assertions about\nulterior motives on the part of the victim to justify case rejection. Spohn and\nher colleagues (Spohn et al., 2001) used data on sexual assaults cleared by\narrest in Miami to replicate and extend Frohmann's (1991) research. Their\nexamination of prosecutors' written justifications for rejecting charges in these\ncases led them to conclude that the prosecutor's assessment of the likelihood\nof conviction was based on factors other than typifications of rape and rape\nvictims. In a substantial number of their cases, the decision to reject charges\ncould be traced to the victim's failure to appear for a pre-file interview, the\nvictim's refusal to cooperate in the prosecution of the case, or the victim's\nadmission that the charges were fabricated. As they noted, in these types of\ncases \"the odds of conviction were low (or nonexistent), not because the pros-\necutor believed that the facts in the case contradicted potential jurors'\nassumptions about rape and rape victims, but because the unavailability of a\nvictim who was willing to testify made it impossible to proceed with the case\"\nIn summary, prior research on police and prosecutorial decisions in sexual\nassault cases suggests that these decisions are affected by a combination of\nlegal and extra-legal factors. As they evaluate cases and assess the likelihood\nof prosecution and conviction, police and prosecutors consider, not only the\nseriousness of the offense and the strength of evidence against the defendant,\nbut also the characteristics, behavior, and reputation of the victim, the rela-\ntionship between the victim and the suspect, and the willingness of the victim\nto cooperate in the investigation of the case.\nTheoretical Perspectives on Police and Prosecutor Decision Making\nResearch on police and prosecutor decision-making is somewhat a-theoretical.\nfrom the sociological theory of law,\" which holds that the quantity of law\napplied in any particular situation depends on factors such as the social status\nof those involved, the relational distance between the parties, and the degree\nof informal social control to which the parties are subjected. In discussing the\ninvestigation of crimes by detectives, Black (1980) argued that the amount of\ntime and energy that will be devoted to a case will depend, not only on the seri-\nousness of the crime, but on the social status, background, reputation, and\ncredibility of the victim and suspect. Although this perspective has not been\napplied to decisions made by prosecutors, it clearly is relevant. Prosecutors,\nlike police, will devote more resources to cases that have a strong likelihood of\na successful outcome.\nAnother theoretical perspective applicable to decision-making in sexual\nassault cases is the focal concerns perspective (Steffensmeier et al., 1998).\nAlthough this perspective was developed to explain judges' sentencing deci-\nsions, it has been applied to prosecutors' charging decisions (see, for example,\nSpohn et al., 2001) and, as we explain below, is also relevant to police deci-\nsion-making. According to this perspective, judges' sentencing decisions are\nguided by three focal concerns: their assessment of the blameworthiness of\nthe offender; their desire to protect the community by incapacitating danger-\nous offenders or deterring potential offenders; and their concerns about the\npractical consequences, or social costs, of sentencing decisions. The first focal\nconcern--offender blameworthiness--reflects judges' assessments of the seri-\nousness of the crime, the offender's prior criminal record, and the offender's\nmotivation and role in the offense. By contrast, the second focal concern--\nprotecting the community--rests on judges' perceptions of the dangerousness\nand threat posed by the offender and the offender's likelihood of recidivism.\nJudges' concerns about the practical consequences or social costs of sentenc-\ning decisions reflect their perceptions regarding the offender's ability \"to do\ntime\" and the costs of incarcerating offenders with medical conditions, mental\nhealth problems, or dependent children, as well as their concerns about main-\ntaining relationships with other members of the courtroom workgroup and pro-\ntecting the reputation of the court.\nWe suggest that the focal concerns that guide police and prosecutor deci-\nsion-making in sexual assault cases are similar, but not identical, to those that\nguide judges' sentencing decisions. Like judges, police officers and prosecuting\nattorneys consider the seriousness of the crime, the degree of injury to the\nvictim, and the blameworthiness and dangerousness of the offender. They also\nare concerned about the practical consequences or social costs of their deci-\nsions, but their concerns focus more on the likelihood of conviction than the\ncosts of incarceration. Although, technically, police decisions to unfound the\nreport or arrest the suspect do not rest on an assessment of convictability, as\na practical matter the police do take this into consideration. They view the\ndecision to arrest as the first step in the process of securing a conviction in\nthe case; as a result, they are reluctant to make arrests that are unlikely to\nlead to the filing of charges against the suspect.\nWe suggest that this concern with convictability creates what Frohmann\n(1997, p. 535) refers to as a \"downstream orientation\" to decision makers who\nwill handle the case at subsequent stages of the process. Whereas Frohmann\n(1997), whose work focused on charging decisions in sexual assault cases, argued\nthat prosecutors consider how the judge, jury, and defense attorney will react\nto the case, we contend that the downstream orientation of detectives investi-\ngating sexual assault cases is to the prosecutors who make filing decisions. That\nis, detectives attempt to predict how prosecutors will assess and respond to the\ncase. Because prosecutors' assessments of cases are based on a standard of con-\nvictability that encourages them \"to accept only `strong' or `winnable' cases for\nprosecution\" (Frohmann, 1991, p. 215), this means that detectives' decisions\nsimilarly will reflect their assessment of the likelihood of conviction should an\narrest be made. In sexual assault cases, in which the victim's testimony is cru-\ncial, these assessments rest squarely on an evaluation of the victim's credibility.\nAs a result, if the victim's allegations are inconsistent or do not comport with\ndetectives' beliefs about the typical sexual assault or if the detective believes\nthat the victim has ulterior motives for reporting the crime or will not cooperate\nas the case moves forward, the likelihood of arrest will decrease.\nBoth the sociological theory of law and the focal concerns perspective sug-\ngest that the \"social structure\" (Black, 1989) of the case influences how the\ncase will be handled. As Black (1989, p. 21) put it, \"the handling of a case\nalways reflects the social characteristics of those involved in it.\" Similarly, the\nfocal concerns perspective holds that the limited information available about\nthe case, especially at early stages in the process, means that decision makers\nwill \"rely on attributional decision-making processes that invoke societal\nand prosecutor decision-making generally and decisions to arrest and charge\nspecifically, these perspectives suggest not only that the social status of the\ncomplainant and suspect will be influential, but that stereotypes of \"real\nrole. Thus, decisions to arrest and to charge the suspect will be based on a\ncombination of factors related to crime seriousness and victim credibility.\nThese perspectives suggest that arrest and prosecution will be more likely if\nthe crime is serious, the victim and suspect are strangers, the victim was\ninjured, the victim's allegations are consistent with detectives' \"typifications\nof rape scenarios\" (Frohmann, 1991, p. 217), and the victim is viewed as credi-\nble and without ulterior motives for making allegations against the suspect.\nThe Current Study\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the decisions made by police and pros-\necutors in sexual assault cases and to identify the predictors of those decisions\n(Spohn & Tellis, 2012). As noted above, the focal concerns perspective sug-\ngests that police and prosecutorial decisions in these types of cases will be\naffected by a combination of legally relevant indicators of crime seriousness\nand evidentiary strength and legally irrelevant victim characteristics. Our pur-\npose also is to demonstrate the ways in which police and prosecutorial deci-\nsions overlap. To illustrate this, we present descriptive data on case outcomes\nand we analyze arrest and charging decisions using multiple indicators of those\noutcomes. Our results indicate that the conclusions one would draw regarding\nthe factors that influence outcomes in sexual assault cases vary depending\nupon the way in which arrest and charging decisions are conceptualized.\nIn the next section, we discuss the policies and practices that guide the\ninvestigation and prosecution of sexual assault cases in Los Angeles County. This\ninformation was gleaned from interviews conducted with detectives and assis-\ntant district attorneys (ADAs) who handle sexual assault cases in Los Angeles.1\nPolicies and Practices in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual\nAssault Cases\nLos Angeles Law Enforcement Agencies\nReports of sexual assault are handled differently by the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment (LAPD) and the LASD. Crimes reported to the LAPD are initially\n1. To enhance our understanding of policies and practices that guided the handling of sexual\nassault cases and to enable us to more accurately interpret the quantitative data, we also con-\nducted interviews with LAPD and LASD detectives who had experience investigating sexual assaults,\nand ADAs from the Victim Impact Program (VIP). During June and July of 2010, we interviewed 52\ndetectives from the LAPD, 24 detectives from the LASD, and 30 attorneys from the Los Angeles\nCounty District Attorney's Office. For a more detailed description of the policies and procedures in\nLos Angeles, see (Spohn & Tellis, 2014).\nhandled by a uniformed patrol officer in one of the LAPD's 21 divisions. The\nresponding officer will prepare the initial report of the crime based on the\nstatements of the victim and witnesses (if any); included will be a description\nof the suspect and, if known, identifying information about the suspect. If the\ncrime was reported promptly, the responding officer also will collect evidence\nfrom the scene of the crime and from the victim and, if she agrees, transport\nthe victim to a rape treatment center or other medical facility for a forensic\nmedical exam. The case is then investigated by one of the detectives in that\ndivision who handles sex crimes.\nThe LASD has (or, rather, had at the time of data collection) a bifurcated\napproach to the investigation of sexual assault based on the age of the victim.\nCrimes involving victims 18 years old or older are handled in much the same\nway as are all sexual assaults reported to the LAPD; the initial report is taken\nby a sheriff's deputy in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred and the case\nis then assigned to a detective from the station house in that jurisdiction.\nCrimes involving victims under the age of 18 are referred to the Special Vic-\ntims Bureau; detectives assigned to this unit take the report from the victim\nand investigate the crime.\nFor both the LAPD and the LASD, the follow-up investigation of a sexual\nassault is handled by the detective assigned to the case, who will pursue leads,\ninterview the victim and any witnesses, and attempt to identify, locate, and\ninterview the suspect. If the detective believes that the complaint is false or\nbaseless, s/he can unfound the report. If there is an identified suspect and\nprobable cause to make an arrest, the detective can clear the case by arrest\nor, under specified circumstances, by exceptional means. If a suspect has not\nbeen identified or there is not probable cause to make an arrest, the case can\nbe kept open or, in the vernacular of the LAPD, \"IC'd\" (investigation continu-\ning).\nLos Angeles District Attorney's Office\nSince 2001, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has had a special-\nized sex crimes unit, the VIP, that vertically prosecutes sexual assault. Each of\nthe 11 branches of the District Attorney's Office utilizes a VIP team approach,\nwith an experienced attorney designated as the VIP Deputy-in-Charge (DIC).\nThe VIP DIC works closely with the ADAs assigned to the VIP team to ensure\nthat sexual assault cases are appropriately prepared and prosecuted. All ADAs\nassigned to a VIP team receive enhanced, on-going training focusing on legal\nissues, potential defenses, and trial tactics.\nAlthough all of the prosecutors interviewed for this project affirmed that\nthe VIP is philosophically committed to the notion of vertical prosecution,\nmany noted that the case screening process varied by branch and by the VIP\nDIC. In some branches case screening and filing decisions are handled by the\nDIC, in others there is a designated case screener, and in still others all\nmembers of the VIP team participate in case screening and make filing deci-\nsions. In branches where \"everyone screens cases,\" if the ADA screening the\ncase decides to file charges, s/he is assigned to prosecute the case. As one\nrespondent noted, \"After filing, we own the case so we take the filing decision\nvery seriously.\" Another respondent expressed a more cynical attitude, noting\nthat \"If you file the dog, you walk the dog.\" In some branches, the VIP DIC\nscreens cases initially and decides whether the case should be rejected; cases\nthat are not rejected outright are assigned to a member of the VIP team, who\nwill conduct the pre-filing interview with the victim and decide whether\ncharges should be filed and, if so, what the charges should be. In other\nbranches, the VIP DIC conducts the interview with the victim and makes the\nfiling decision; cases that are filed are assigned to a member of the VIP team\nfor prosecution.\nIt is important to point out that the standard used by the Los Angeles\nCounty District Attorney's Office in screening cases is a trial sufficiency stan-\ndard (Jacoby, 1980). That is, the ADA will file charges only if there is sufficient\nevidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt at a jury trial. More-\nover, the policy in sexual assault cases is that charges will not be filed without\nsome type of corroboration of the victim's testimony--DNA evidence that\nestablishes the identity of the perpetrator, injuries to the victim, witnesses\nwho can corroborate the victim's testimony, or physical or medical evidence\nthat is consistent with the victim's account of the incident. Although there are\nsome exceptions, a pre-filing interview designed to assess the victim's credibil-\nity and willingness to cooperate in the prosecution of the case also is required.\nThe Process of Case Clearance\nAccording to the Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook (Federal Bureau of Inves-\ntigation, 2004), law enforcement agencies can clear offenses either by arrest\nor by exceptional means. The handbook states that \"an offense is cleared by\narrest, or solved for crime reporting purposes, when at least one person is\n(1) arrested, (2) charged with the commission of the offense, and (3) turned\nover to the court for prosecution (whether following arrest, court summons, or\npolice notice)\" (p. 79). Regarding exceptional clearances, the handbook notes\nthat there may be occasions where law enforcement has conducted an investi-\ngation, exhausted all leads, and identified a suspect but is nonetheless unable\nto clear an offense by arrest. In this situation, the agency can clear the\noffense by exceptional means, provided that each of the following questions\ncan be answered in the affirmative (pp. 80\u00ad81):\n\u00b7 Has the investigation definitely established the identity of the offender?\n\u00b7 Is the exact location of the offender known so that the subject could be\ntaken into custody now?\n\u00b7 Is there enough information to support an arrest, charge,2 and turning over\nto the court for prosecution?\n\u00b7 Is there some reason outside law enforcement control that precludes\narresting, charging, and prosecuting the offender?\nTo illustrate the types of cases that might be cleared by exceptional means,\nthe handbook provides a list of examples, many of which involve the death of\nthe offender or an offender who is unable to be arrested because s/he is being\nprosecuted in another jurisdiction for a different crime or because extradition\nhas been denied. One of the examples provided is when the \"victim refuses to\ncooperate in the prosecution,\" but there is an added proviso, which states that\nthis alone does not justify an exceptional clearance and that the answer must\nalso be yes to the first three questions outlined above (Federal Bureau of\nAnalysis of case outcomes and interviews with detectives and district attor-\nneys revealed that both the LAPD and the LASD have complicated rules for\nclearing cases, misinterpret UCR guidelines regarding the two types of case\nclearances (cleared by arrest and cleared by exceptional means), and overuse\n(misuse) the exceptional clearance (for a more detailed discussion of this pro-\ncess, see Spohn & Tellis, 2011). If the detective investigating the crime has\nidentified a suspect and has probable cause to arrest the suspect, the detec-\ntive will either arrest the individual and present the case to an ADA from the\nVIP of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for a filing decision, or\ndelay making an arrest and present the case to an ADA for a pre-arrest charge\nevaluation.\nThe ADA reviewing the case following the arrest of the suspect can either\naccept the case for prosecution, send the case back to the investigating officer\n(IO) for further investigation (although this is complicated by the fact that\ncharges must be filed within 48 hours of the suspect's arrest), send the case to\nthe city attorney for prosecution as a misdemeanor, or decline the case for\nprosecution. Because LAPD policy states that cases can be cleared by arrest\nonly if the district attorney files charges, if charges are declined, the LAPD\ndetective changes the case clearance category from cleared by arrest to\ncleared by exceptional means. The LASD does not have a similar policy, but,\ndepending on the preferences of the detective's supervisor and/or the detec-\ntive's own interpretation of UCR policies on exceptional clearances, a LASD\ndetective may also recategorize the case from cleared by arrest to cleared by\nexceptional means if the district attorney declines to file charges against the\nsuspect. Because the UCR Handbook clearly states that cases can be cleared\nby exceptional means only if there is something beyond the control of law\nenforcement that prevents them from making an arrest, this is a misuse of the\n2. This refers to a police booking procedure; not a prosecutorial filing decision (FBI Section Chief\nexceptional clearance. Cases in which a suspect is arrested should be cleared\nby arrest, regardless of whether charges are filed by the district attorney.\nSimilar procedures are followed if the case is evaluated by the district attor-\nney prior to the arrest of the suspect. If the evidence in the case meets the\ndistrict attorney's standard for filing, the suspect will be arrested and the case\nwill be cleared by arrest. If the case is sent back for further investigation or if\nthe evidence is deemed insufficient to justify charging, the IO will either con-\ntinue the investigation and, once additional evidence is obtained, resubmit the\ncase for a second review by the district attorney, or--and this is what more\ntypically happens--end the investigation and clear the case by exceptional\nmeans. This, too, may be a misuse of the exceptional clearance. If the detec-\ntive has probable cause to make an arrest but the victim tells the district\nattorney that she does not want the suspect arrested or is unwilling to cooper-\nate in the prosecution of the case, the case can be cleared by exceptional\nmeans (provided that the identity and location of the suspect are known).\nAlthough one might argue that the suspect should be arrested if there is proba-\nble cause to make an arrest, the victim's unwillingness to cooperate is some-\nthing that is beyond the control of law enforcement. On the other hand, the\ncase should not be cleared by exceptional means if the district attorney decli-\nnes to file charges because the evidence in the cases does not meet the filing\nstandard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If there is probable cause to\narrest the suspect and the victim is cooperative, the suspect should be\narrested and the case cleared by arrest, as there is nothing beyond the control\nof law enforcement that prevents them from making an arrest. Alternatively,\nthe detective could continue the investigation and, once additional evidence is\nobtained, resubmit the case to the district attorney.\nResearch Design and Methods\nThis study entailed the collection of quantitative data on sex crimes reported\nto the Los Angeles Police Department and the LASD. From each agency, we\nobtained the complete case files for sexual assaults involving female victims\nover the age of 12 that were reported in 2008; the LAPD and the LASD\nredacted all information that could be used to identify the victims, suspects,\nwitnesses, or law enforcement officials assigned to investigate the case and\nthen provided us with a copy of the redacted file. From the LASD we obtained\ncase files for all reports that met our selection criteria (N = 543). Due to the\nlarge number of cases reported to the LAPD in 2008, we selected a stratified\nrandom sample of cases (N = 401). Because we wanted to ensure an adequate\nnumber of cases from each of the LAPD's 19 divisions,3 as well as an adequate\nnumber of cases from each case clearance category (i.e. cleared by arrest,\ncleared by exceptional means, investigation continuing, and unfounded), the\nsample was stratified by LAPD division and, within each division, by the type of\ncase clearance.4 For this study, we include only cases in which the most seri-\nous charge was rape or attempted rape (N = 650); cases in which sexual bat-\ntery (i.e. sexual contact) was the most serious charge were deleted.\nBecause we were provided with the complete case file for each of the 2008\ncases, we were able to extract very detailed quantitative and qualitative infor-\nmation on each case. The case file included the crime report prepared by the\npatrol officer who responded to the crime and took the initial report from the\nvictim, all follow-up reports prepared by the detective to whom the case was\nassigned for investigation, and the detective's reasons for unfounding the\nreport or for clearing the case by arrest or by exceptional means. The case\nfiles also included either verbatim accounts or summaries of statements made\nby the victim, witnesses (if any), and the suspect (if the suspect was inter-\nviewed); a description of physical evidence recovered from the alleged crime\nscene; and the results of the forensic medical sexual assault exam of the vic-\ntim (if she reported the crime within 72 hours of the alleged assault). Members\nof the research team read through each case file and recorded data in an SPSS\ndata file. Coding protocols were developed by the researchers, who reviewed\nand double-coded a sample of the files to ensure that there was consistency\nand intercoder reliability (Alpha = .91)\nData for the Study\nBecause our focus is on arrest and charging decisions, and because arrest (and\ncharging) is not possible unless there is an identified suspect, for this project\nwe selected all rape and attempted rape cases in which the police knew the\nidentify and location of the suspect. Of the 650 cases in the original sample,\n530 (81.5 percent) were cases with an identified suspect. Because there were\nvery few victims who were not white, Black, or Hispanic, we also eliminated\ncases (N = 31) involving victims who were Asian American or other races. This\nresulted in a data file with 491 cases; 171 were cases reported to the LAPD\nand 320 were cases reported to the LASD.\n4. Our goal was to select 6 cases from each case closure type from each of the 19 divisions that\nexisted in 2008. This would have produced a sample of 456 cases. Because each division did not\nnecessarily have 6 cases from each case closure type in 2008, the final sample included 401 cases.\nWe created a weighted sample that divided the percentage of each stratum (that is, each case clo-\nsure type for each division) in the population of cases by the percentage of each stratum in the\nsample (see footnote 1). We use the unweighted data when we are focusing on a particular type of\ncase closure (e.g. unfounded cases or cases that were cleared by exceptional means). We use the\nweighted data when discussing 2008 case outcomes and when providing descriptive statistics for\nthese cases.\nDependent and Independent Variables\nOur dependent variables are measures of decisions made by police and prose-\ncutors in sexual assault cases. Beginning with the decision to arrest, we con-\nceptualize this decision in two ways. The first is a dichotomous measure of\nwhether the case was cleared by arrest and the second is a dichotomous indi-\ncator of whether the suspect was arrested. As explained above, both the LAPD\nand, to a lesser extent, the LASD change the case clearance category from\ncleared by arrest to cleared by exceptional means in cases in which they make\nan arrest but the district attorney does not file felony charges. Focusing only\non cases that were cleared by arrest, in other words, means that not all cases\nthat resulted in the arrest of a suspect are \"counted\" as arrests. Our third\ndependent variable is a dichotomous indicator of whether the investigating\ndetective presented the case to an ADA for pre-arrest charge evaluation. This\nvariable is coded 1 if the case was presented to the district attorney prior to\nthe arrest of the suspect; it is coded 0 if the case was presented following the\narrest of the suspect. We also conceptualize the charging decision in two\nways.5 The first, which is the conceptualization used by prior research, exami-\nnes charging outcomes only for cases that resulted in the arrest of a suspect\n(N = 210); the second, which we argue more accurately captures the decisions\nthat prosecutors make, examines charging decisions in all cases that were pre-\nsented to the district attorney for a charge evaluation, regardless of whether\nthe suspect was arrested or not (N = 357). For both variables, cases in which\ncharges were filed are coded 1 and cases in which charges were rejected are\ncoded 0. We use binary logistic regression analysis to analyze each of our\ndichotomous dependent variables.\nOur independent variables are drawn from Black's sociological theory of law\nand from the focal concerns perspective (as applied to police and prosecutor\ndecision-making). They include victim characteristics, indicators of crime seri-\nousness, and measures of the strength of evidence in the case. The victim\ncharacteristics include the victim's age, race/ethnicity, relationship with the\nsuspect, whether the victim engaged in what might be perceived as risky\nbehavior at the time of the incident, and whether the case file indicated that\nthe victim had characteristics that would make police and prosecutors question\nher credibility. The victim's age is a continuous variable that ranges from 12\nto 60 (mean = 26.03). The victim's race/ethnicity is coded as white, black, or\nHispanic (whites are the reference category) and the relationship between the\nvictim and the suspect is coded as intimate partners, nonstrangers, or stran-\ngers (strangers are the reference category). The risk-taking variable, which\nreflects legally irrelevant stereotypes about real rapes and genuine victims, is\ncoded 1 if the case file indicated that at the time of the incident the victim\n5. We were unable to separately analyze cases that were presented to an ADA for a pre-arrest\ncharge evaluation due to the fact that all of 9 of these 147 cases were rejected for prosecution.\neither was walking alone late at night, accepted a ride from a stranger, volun-\ntarily went to the suspect's house, invited the suspect to her residence, was in\na bar alone, was in an area where illegal drugs were sold, was drinking alcohol,\nwas drunk, was using illegal drugs, or had passed out after drinking alcohol\nand/or using illegal drugs. We use this composite variable, rather than the\nindividual variables, because of the small number of victims who were engaged\nin any of these types of behavior at the time of the incident. Of the cases in\nwhich the most serious charge was rape or attempted rape, 35.1 percent\n(N = 125) involved some type of risky behavior, typically walking alone late at\nnight or drinking alcohol.\nThe character/reputation variable is also a composite of several factors that\nmight lead officials to question the victim's credibility. This variable was\ncoded 1 if there was information in the case file indicating that the victim had\na pattern of alcohol or drug abuse, had a disreputable job (e.g. stripper, exo-\ntic dancer), or was a prostitute, or had a criminal record. There were 49 cases\n(13.8 percent) with one or more of these character issues.6 The final two vic-\ntim characteristics measure whether there was information in the case file to\nindicate that the victim had a mental illness or mental health issues (yes = 1;\nno = 0)7 or to indicate that the victim had a motive to lie about being sexually\nConsistent with the focal concerns perspective, our model also includes a\nnumber of indicators of the seriousness of the sexual assault and the danger-\nousness of the suspect, including whether the most serious charge was rape\n(which includes oral copulation, sodomy, and penetration with an object in\naddition to penile-vaginal penetration) rather than attempted rape, whether\nthe suspect used a weapon during the assault (yes = 1; no = 0), and whether\nthe suspect physically as well as sexually assaulted the victim (yes = 1; no = 0).\nIn addition, our indicators of case seriousness include a variable that measures\nwhether the victim suffered some type of collateral injury (e.g. bruises, cuts,\n6. This variable was coded 1 if the case file indicated that the victim was currently or had been in\nthe past a patient at a mental health facility, that the victim was taking medication for a mental\nhealth problem, or if a family member or friend told the responding officer or the detective that\nthe victim had a mental illness or mental health issues.\n7. Information about whether the victim had a motive to lie was obtained either from the victim's\nstatement, the interview of the victim by the IO, or the statement of witnesses. Examples of the\ntypes of statements found in the case file regarding the victim's motive to lie are the following:\n\"all informants interviewed said the victim fabricated the incident because her parents found out\nshe was sexually active,\" \"victim was angry with suspect because he would not give her crack\ncocaine,\" \"the victim was angry that the suspect returned to his wife,\" \"the victim is involved in a\ncustody dispute with the suspect,\" \"victim was angry with suspect because he broke off the affair\nwith her,\" \"victim did not want her mother to find out what she did,\" \"victim was cheating on her\nhusband with the suspect,\" \"suspect (victim's boyfriend) was flirting with another woman at a\nparty,\" \"suspect has nude photos of victim and victim found out that suspect has another girl-\nfriend,\" \"the girls were afraid that they would get in trouble for coming home late.\"\n8. This information was obtained from the report of the sexual assault examination, from the\nresponding officer's description of the victim's physical condition, and/or from the victim's and/or\nwitnesses' statements in the case file.\nchoke marks) during the assault (yes = 1; no = 0) (see footnote 8). Finally, we\nmeasure whether the victim verbally or physically resisted the suspect using a\nset of dummy variables that includes no verbal or physical resistance, verbal\nresistance only, physical resistance only, and both verbal and physical resis-\ntance (no verbal or physical resistance is the reference category).9\nBecause of the importance of evidentiary factors in arrest and charging\ndecisions, we control for several variables that measure the strength of evi-\ndence in the case. The first is whether the victim made a prompt report\n(yes = 1; no = 0), which we define as a report within one hour of the incident.10\nOther evidentiary factors include the number of witnesses to the alleged\nassault and whether the victim was willing to cooperate as the case moved for-\nward (yes = 1; no = 0).11 Our final evidentiary factor is a composite measure\nthat is coded 1 if any of the following types of evidence were collected from\nthe victim or from the scene of the incident: fingerprints, blood, hair, skin\nsamples, clothing, bedding, or semen. To capture differences between the two\nlaw enforcement agencies, we include a variable measuring whether the case\nwas reported to the LAPD (coded 1) or the LASD (coded 0).\nFindings\nCase Outcomes\nThe outcomes of the sexual assault cases reported to the LAPD and the LASD\nare shown in Tables 1 and 2. The data presented in Table 1 indicate that, for\nboth agencies combined, the percentage of rape and attempted rape cases\nwith an identified suspect in which a suspect was arrested was 46.8 percent;\n9. The type of resistance was obtained from the victim's statement. We originally coded six types\nof verbal resistance (cried, screamed, refused/protested/said stop, attempt to dissuade/fool, calls\nnames/denigrates suspect, passive/saying nothing) and five types of physical resistance (fled/at-\ntempted to flee, resisted/struggled, fought (hit, scratched, bit), used a weapon to defend, pas-\nsive/did nothing to resist). Because there could be multiple types of resistance, we coded verbal\nresistance 1 if the case file indicated that there was any type of verbal resistance; similarly, we\ncoded physical resistance 1 if the file indicated that there was any type of physical resistance.\n10. One fourth of the victims in these cases reported the incident within one hour. We opera-\ntionalized a prompt report in this way based on our interviews with detectives, who emphasized\nthat the failure to report the crime within an hour or two made it more likely that the victim\nwould shower or launder clothing or bedding, which would reduce the likelihood of collecting phys-\nical evidence from the victim or the crime scene.\n11. Whether the victim was willing to cooperate with the detective assigned to the case was deter-\nmined from the case file. If the victim was uncooperative, it would be noted in the file by the IO.\nFor example, the IO might have noted that he/she had attempted to contact the victim but the\nvictim refused to talk to him/her (either via telephone or in person), that the victim stated that\nshe did not want anything to happen to the suspect/that she did not want the suspect arrested,\nthat the victim said (for a variety of reasons) that she did not want to take the case to court, that\nthe victim stated that she was no longer interested in pursuing a criminal prosecution, or that the\nvictim refused to participate in a pre-filing interview with the district attorney's office.\nthe arrest rate was 40.4 percent for the LAPD and 50.3 percent for the LASD.\nOf the cases that resulted in an arrest, only 71.3 percent were cleared by\narrest; the remaining cases (28.7 percent) were cleared by exceptional means\nwhen the district attorney refused to file felony charges. The rate at which\narrested cases were formally cleared by arrest was higher for the LASD (75.2\npercent) than for the LAPD (62.3 percent). Considering both law enforcement\nagencies, there were 357 cases in which the district attorney made a charging\ndecision. As shown in Table 2, 147 cases (41.2 percent) were presented to an\nADA before the suspect was arrested and 210 cases (58.8 percent) were pre-\nsented after the suspect was arrested. Of the cases presented before arrest,\nthe ADA filed charges in only 9 (6.1 percent) cases. By contrast, charges were\nfiled in 106 (50.5 percent) of the cases presented to the ADA following the\narrest of the suspect. The discrepancy in outcomes for cases reviewed by the\nprosecutor before and after the arrest of the suspect--and especially the fact\nthat cases reviewed prior to the suspect's arrest rarely resulted in the filing of\ncharges--suggests that detectives present weak or problematic cases to the\nTable 1 Indicators of arrest: rape and attempted rape cases with an identified sus-\nAll cases\nLAPD cases\nLASD cases\nN % N % N %\nTable 2 Outcomes of cases presented to the Los Angeles District Attorney for charge\nevaluation before and after arrest of suspect, 2008\nCharge evaluation\nbefore suspect's\nCharge evaluation\nafter suspect's\nN % N %\nDistrict attorney filed charges\nCase clearance--cases rejected by LADA\nADA prior to making an arrest, perhaps with an expectation that charges will\nbe rejected and the case can be closed. Coupled with the fact that more than\na fourth of the rape and attempted rape cases in which the police made an\narrest were not cleared by arrest but by exceptional means, this suggests that\nthe decision to arrest is not adequately measured by examining only cases that\nwere cleared by arrest and that the charging decision is not effectively mea-\nsured by examining only cases that were evaluated following the arrest of the\nsuspect.\nPredictors of Police Decision Making\nThe results of our analysis of the two arrest variables (suspect arrested and\ncase cleared by arrest) and of the detective's decision to present the case to\nthe district attorney for charge evaluation prior to the arrest of the suspect\nare presented in Table 3. The decision to arrest the suspect was not affected\nby any of the victim characteristics; instead, this decision was affected by all\nof the indictors of crime seriousness except the type of resistance offered by\nthe victim and by all four measures of the strength of evidence in the case.\nConsistent with our theoretical expectations, arrest was more likely if the\ncrime was more serious, as measured by whether the suspect physically, as\nwell as sexually, assaulted the victim, whether the suspect used a weapon,\nand whether the victim suffered some type of collateral injury; by contrast,\narrest was less likely if the crime involved rape rather than attempted rape.\nThe police were more likely to arrest the suspect if the victim reported the\ncrime within one hour, the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation,\nand there was physical evidence from the victim or the crime scene; the likeli-\nhood of arrest also increased as the number of witnesses increased.\nIn contrast to these results, which suggest that arrest decisions are based on\nlegally relevant factors, the results of the analysis of cases that were officially\ncleared by arrest indicate that this outcome was affected by a combination of\nindicators of crime seriousness and evidentiary strength and victim characteris-\ntics. The case was less likely to be cleared by arrest if the case file contained\ninformation that raised questions about the victim's reputation or character,\nthe victim had a motive to lie, or the case involved rape rather than\nattempted rape. Consistent with the results for the arrest decision, the case\nwas more likely to be cleared by arrest if the suspect used a weapon, the vic-\ntim suffered collateral injuries, the victim reported the crime within one hour,\nand the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation of the crime. Nei-\nther outcome, on the other hand, was affected by the victim's age, race/eth-\nnicity, or relationship with the suspect; by whether the victim engaged in\nbehavior that could be perceived as risky at the time of the incident or had a\nmental illness or mental health issues, or by the type of resistance offered by\nthe victim.\nTable 3 Results of the logistic regression analyses of three indicators of arrest out-\ncomes\nSuspect arrested\nCase cleared by\narrest\nCase presented to\nthe DA For charge\nevaluation prior to\nsuspect's arrest\nExp\n(B) B SE\nExp\n(B) B SE\nExp\n(B)\nVictim characteristics\nRace/Ethnicity\nRelationship with Suspect\nQuestions about\ncharacter/reputation\nMental illness or\nmental health issues\nIndicators of crime seriousness\nMost serious charge is\nrape\nSuspect physically\nassaulted victim\nSuspect used a\nweapon\nVictim suffered\ncollateral injury\nType of resistance\nVerbal resistance\nonly\nPhysical resistance\nonly\nBoth verbal and\nphysical resistance\nStrength of evidence\nVictim reported crime\nwithin one hour\n(Continued)\nWe also analyzed whether the detective investigating the crime presented\nthe case/case file to the district attorney for a pre-arrest charge evaluation.\nThe frequency with which sexual assault cases are presented to the district\nattorney for charge evaluation prior to the suspect's arrest, coupled with the\nfact that the outcomes of cases evaluated prior to and following the arrest of\nthe suspect differ significantly, suggests that it is important to identify the fac-\ntors that predict whether cases will be presented to the ADA and evaluated\nbefore or after arrest. As shown in the third column of Table 3, only one vic-\ntim characteristic--whether the victim engaged in any risky behavior at the\ntime of the alleged assault--influenced whether the case would be presented\nto the district attorney for a pre-arrest charge evaluation. Cases involving vic-\ntims who engaged in what could be perceived as risky behavior were 1.9 times\nmore likely to be presented to the district attorney prior to the arrest of the\nsuspect. Surprisingly, given the comments of detectives, many of whom stated\nthat cases involving non-strangers were much more likely to be subjected to\npre-arrest charge evaluation, the relationship between the suspect and the vic-\ntim did not affect the likelihood that the case would be presented to the dis-\ntrict attorney prior to the arrest of the suspect.\nThe odds of a pre-arrest charge evaluation also were affected by two indica-\ntors of crime seriousness and all four measures of evidentiary strength. Com-\npared to cases in which the most serious charge was attempted rape, cases in\nwhich rape was the most serious charge were over six times more likely to be\npresented to the district attorney before the suspect could be arrested. The\nlikelihood of a pre-arrest charge evaluation was significantly lower for cases in\nwhich the suspect used some type of weapon, the victim reported the crime\nwithin one hour, the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation, there\nwas some type of physical evidence, and there were one or more witnesses.\nTable 3 (Continued)\nSuspect arrested\nCase cleared by\narrest\nCase presented to\nthe DA For charge\nevaluation prior to\nsuspect's arrest\nExp\n(B) B SE\nExp\n(B) B SE\nExp\n(B)\nVictim is willing to\ncooperate\nNote. Significant coefficients are in bold.\nThese results, then, suggest that detectives bring cases in which the evidence\nis weaker or there are questions about the victim's behavior at the time of the\nincident to district attorneys for a pre-arrest charge evaluation.\nPredictors of Prosecutors' Charging Decisions\nAs noted above, the outcomes of cases presented to the district attorney for a\ncharging decision before and after the arrest of the suspect were very differ-\nent: only 9 of the 147 cases evaluated before the suspect was arrested were\naccepted for prosecution; by contrast, 106 of the 210 cases evaluated after\nthe suspect was arrested were accepted for prosecution. We therefore analyze\ntwo indicators of charging--whether the district attorney accepted the case\nfor prosecution following the arrest of the suspect and whether the district\nattorney accepted the case for prosecution either before or after the arrest of\nthe suspect--and we argue that the latter is a more accurate and valid mea-\nsure of prosecutors' charging decisions.\nThe results of our analysis of these variables, which are shown in Table 4,\nreveal that different factors affect the two outcomes. Beginning with the more\ntraditional conceptualization of charging--charging decisions that follow the\narrest of the suspect--only three variables affect this outcome: the victim's\nage (charging is four and a half times more likely if the victim is under the age\nof 18); whether the victim had a motive to lie; and whether the victim was\nwilling to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of the case. In fact,\nprosecutors were nearly 19 times more likely to file charges if the victim was\ncooperative and they were about 6 times more likely to accept the case for\nprosecution if the victim did not have a motive to lie. Although our broader\nindicator of charging, which includes charging decisions made before or after\nthe arrest of the suspect, is affected in the same way by these three variables,\nit also is affected by victim behavior that can be perceived as risky, whether\nthe most serious charge was rape rather than attempted rape, whether the\nsuspect used a weapon, and whether the victim reported the crime within one\nhour. Consistent with the results of the arrest decisions, charging was not\naffected by the victim's race/ethnicity or relationship with the suspect,\nwhether the victim had a mental illness or mental health issues, or the type of\nresistance offered by the victim.\nDiscussion\nThe results of our analysis reveal that arresting and charging decisions in sex-\nual assault cases are affected by legally relevant indicators of case seriousness\nand evidentiary strength and, depending upon the way in which the outcome is\noperationally defined, by legally irrelevant indicators of the victim's behavior\nat the time of the incident and her character, reputation, and motivation in\nreporting the crime to the police. These findings are consistent with the focal\nconcerns perspective and, to a lesser extent, with Black's sociological theory\nof law. They suggest that the decisions of police and prosecutors, like those of\njudges, are affected by their perceptions of crime seriousness and offender\nTable 4 Results of the logistic regression analyses of charging decisions\nCase presented to DA\nafter suspect's arrest\nand DA filed charges\nCase presented to DA\nbefore or after\nsuspect's arrest and\nDA filed charges\nExp\n(B) B SE Exp(B)\nVictim characteristics\nRace/Ethnicity\nRelationship with suspect\nIndicators of crime seriousness\nType of resistance\nStrength of evidence\nVictim reported crime within one\nhour\nNote. Significant coefficients are in bold.\ndangerousness and by their assessments of the likelihood of conviction, which\nare themselves influenced not only by the strength of evidence in the case but\n1997) of rape and rape victims. Our results thus provide further evidence of\nthe utility of the focal concerns perspective and of its applicability to decisions\nother than sentencing.\nOur findings are not consistent with Black's (1989, p. 21) assertions that the\n\"handling of a case always reflects the social characteristics of those involved\nin it.\" The race/ethnicity of the victim did not affect any of the case out-\ncomes and the age of the victim affected charging, but not arrest, decisions.\nIn contrast to prior research (Frazier & Haney, 1996; Holleran et al., 2010; Tel-\nlis & Spohn, 2008), which found that sexual assaults involving strangers were\ntreated more harshly than those involving acquaintances or intimate partners,\nwe also found that the victim/suspect relationship did not affect any of the\noutcomes we examined. This is surprising, given Black's (1976) contention that\ncase outcomes are affected by the \"relational distance\" between the victim\nand the suspect and given that all of the cases included in our study were\ncases with an identified suspect. We expected that in cases with an identified\nsuspect, the police would be more likely to arrest and the prosecutor would be\nmore likely to file charges if the victim and the suspect were strangers. The\nfact that the relationship between the victim and suspect did not affect case\noutcomes once other victim characteristics, indicators of case seriousness, and\nmeasures of evidentiary strength were taken into consideration suggests that it\nis not the victim/suspect relationship per se that influences arresting and\ncharging decisions; rather, the characteristics of cases and the strength of the\nevidence vary depending on the type of relationship.\nThe findings of our study also make a number of important methodological\ncontributions.\nPrior research on police and prosecutorial decision-making has been criti-\ncized for failure to control adequately for crime seriousness and strength of\nevidence in the case, with critics arguing that models that lack these measures\nare misspecified. Because we had access to the case files, we were able to col-\nlect detailed data on physical evidence, witnesses, whether the victim was\nwilling to cooperate at various stages in the process, and whether the victim\nreported the crime promptly. We also were able to collect several indicators\nof crime seriousness--whether the suspect used a weapon or physically\nassaulted the victim and whether the victim suffered some type of collateral\ninjury. The fact that we were able to control for these legally relevant factors\nmay explain why some of the factors identified by prior research did not affect\nthe arrest and charging decisions we examined.\nWe also demonstrate the importance of the ways in which arrest and charg-\ning decisions are conceptualized and operationalized. The concept of \"cleared\nby arrest\" plays a key role in research on police and prosecutorial decision-\nmaking. Policing researchers often operationalize the decision to arrest based\non whether the crime was cleared by the arrest of a suspect and researchers\nexamining prosecutorial charging decisions typically examine data on cases\nthat resulted in an arrest and were presented by law enforcement for a formal\ncharging decision. These operational definitions are based on assumptions that\nall cases that result in the arrest of a suspect are cases that are cleared by\narrest and that the only cases on which prosecutors make charging decisions\nare cases in which a suspect was arrested. As we have shown, these assump-\ntions are not necessarily valid. At least in this jurisdiction (Los Angeles) and\nfor this type of crime (sexual assault), a substantial proportion of cases in\nwhich a suspect was arrested were not cleared by arrest; this occurred when\nthe district attorney reviewing the case following the arrest of the suspect\nrejected the case for prosecution and the detective investigating the crime\nchanged the case clearance from cleared by arrest to cleared by exceptional\nmeans. Moreover, a significant number of cases were evaluated--and rejected\nfor prosecution--by the district attorney prior to the arrest of the suspect.\nDefining the decision to arrest as cases that were formally cleared by arrest\nand operationalizing the charging decision as cases that were evaluated follow-\ning arrest is misleading, as doing so undercounts both types of decisions.\nFurther evidence of this surfaced in our multivariate analyses of arresting\nand charging decisions. We found that the predictors of these outcomes varied\ndepending on the way in which the outcome was defined. For example, none\nof the victim characteristics affected whether the suspect was arrested by the\npolice, but whether there were questions about the victim's character or repu-\ntation and whether the victim had a motive to lie about the incident predicted\nthe likelihood that the crime would be cleared by arrest. These differences\nreflect the fact that many of the cases that resulted in the arrest of the sus-\npect, but did not result in the filing of charges by the prosecutor, are not\ndefined as cases that are cleared by arrest (due to the fact that the detective\nchanged the case clearance from cleared by arrest to cleared by exceptional\nmeans). The cleared by arrest variable, in other words, conflates decisions\nmade by police and prosecutors. The fact that these victim characteristics\naffected whether the case was cleared by arrest but not whether the police\nmade an arrest suggests that the police are willing to make arrests in poten-\ntially problematic cases but that prosecutors are not willing to file charges in\nthese cases. Alternatively, it may be that questions about the victim's charac-\nter, reputation, or motivation for filing the complaint do not surface--or do\nnot raise red flags if they do--until the victim is interviewed by the district\nattorney.\nWe also found that different variables affected our two indicators of charg-\ning. When we used the traditional operational definition--the suspect was\narrested and the district attorney evaluated the case for prosecution--we\nfound that only three variables (the victim's age, whether the victim was will-\ning to cooperate, and whether the victim had a motive to lie) affected the\nlikelihood of charging. Our analysis of the charging variable that combined\ncases screened before and after the arrest of the suspect revealed that four\nadditional variables--whether the victim engaged in risky behavior, whether\nthe most serious charge was rape, whether the suspect used a weapon, and\nwhether the victim reported the crime within one hour--had an effect. These\nresults suggest that detectives present problematic cases in which there is an\nidentified suspect and in which there may be probable cause to make an arrest\nto the district attorney for a charge evaluation before arresting the suspect\nand that these cases are rejected for prosecution. That this is, in fact, what is\noccurring was confirmed by our analysis of the detective's decision to present\nthe case to the district attorney for a pre-arrest charge evaluation. Detectives\nwere significantly more likely to bring the case to the district attorney before\narresting the suspect if the victim engaged in risky behavior, did not report\nthe crime promptly, and was unwilling to cooperate as the case moved for-\nward; if the suspect did not use a weapon; if there was no physical evidence,\nand if there were no or few witnesses. In fact, we found that the various mea-\nsures of the strength of evidence in the case had a positive effect on whether\nthe suspect would be arrested and whether the case would be cleared by\narrest, but a negative effect on whether the case would be presented to the\ndistrict attorney for charge evaluation prior to the arrest of the suspect. Cou-\npled with the fact that all but 9 of the 147 cases evaluated by the district\nattorney prior to the arrest of the suspect were rejected for prosecution, this\nsuggests that pre-arrest charge evaluation is an important component of both\npolice and prosecutorial decision-making.\nThe detectives and district attorneys we interviewed acknowledged that\npre-arrest charge evaluation either was unique to sexual assault or occurred\nwith much greater frequency in sexual assault cases than in other types of\ncases. They attributed this to the fact that many sexual assaults involve vic-\ntims and suspects who are acquainted in some way and that a good portion of\nthese involve a consent defense, delayed reporting, and/or alcohol or drug use\nby the victim. Although a number of respondents--especially district attorneys\n--justified pre-arrest charge evaluation as a means of ensuring that the evi-\ndence in the case was solid before the suspect was arrested, many detectives\nacknowledged that they presented cases to the district attorney before arrest-\ning the suspect with the expectation that the case would be rejected for pros-\necution. This suggests that pre-arrest charge evaluation is being used, not to\nensure that \"all of the i's are dotted and the t's crossed,\" but to dispose of\nweak or problematic cases. This is confirmed by the fact that all but three of\nthe 138 cases rejected for prosecution prior to the arrest of the suspect were\ncleared by exceptional means. Rather than arresting the suspect, detectives\npresent cases that they believe will be rejected for prosecution to the district\nattorney and, when that happens, they clear, or solve, these cases exception-\nally.\nOne other finding merits comment. We found that only one variable--\nwhether the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation and prosecu-\ntion of the case--affected all five of the outcomes we examined. In fact, vic-\ntim cooperation had a substantial effect on each outcome. The police were six\ntimes more likely to arrest the suspect and were nearly 10 times more likely\nto clear the case by arrest if the victim was cooperative; they were signifi-\ncantly less likely to present the case to the district attorney for a pre-arrest\ncharge evaluation if the victim was willing to cooperate. The effect of victim\ncooperation on charging decisions was even more pronounced; cases with a\ncooperative victim were almost 15 times more likely to result in the filing of\ncharges before or after the suspect's arrest and were almost 19 times more\nlikely to result in the filing of charges following the arrest of the suspect.\nThese findings, although not surprising, point to the importance of the individ-\nual-level dynamic between victims and detectives and between victims and\nprosecutors. They also suggest that a fruitful avenue for future research would\nbe to determine why victims withdraw their cooperation after making a sexual\nassault report.\nOur results have important policy implications. We found that law enforce-\nment officials in Los Angeles overuse (in fact, misuse) the exceptional clear-\nance in two important situations: when an arrest does not lead to the filing of\nfelony charges and when cases are rejected for prosecution during the pre-ar-\nrest charge evaluation. Regarding the first situation, cases that result in the\narrest of a suspect should be cleared by arrest, as these cases do not meet the\nfourth requirement for clearing cases by exceptional means. Given that the\nsuspect was arrested, there is by definition nothing beyond the control of law\nenforcement that prevents an arrest. Thus, cases in which a suspect is arrested\nshould be cleared by arrest. The second situation in which cases may be\ncleared incorrectly by exceptional means is where probable cause to arrest the\nsuspect exists but the detective chooses instead to present the case to the dis-\ntrict attorney's office, where charges are rejected based on insufficient evi-\ndence. Like the first scenario, this situation is problematic in that it does not\ninvolve something beyond the control of the law enforcement that prevents\nthe arrest of the suspect. There is probable cause to make an arrest but the\ncase is cleared exceptionally because a prosecutor determined that the evi-\ndence is insufficient to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.\nWhether a suspect is arrested should not be contingent on whether the pros-\necuting attorney believes that the evidence meets the standard of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and that the case therefore would result in a jury\nconviction. Doing so subjects the decision to arrest to a higher standard of\nproof than is required by law and effectively gives the prosecutor control over\nthe decision to arrest. It also means that individuals who may have committed\na serious crime are not held accountable for their behavior and denies justice\nto victims who made a difficult decision to report the crime and are willing to\ncooperate with the police and prosecutor as the case moves forward. Failure\nto make an arrest in spite of probable cause to do so is reminiscent of police\ninaction in response to domestic violence prior to the implementation of\nmandatory arrest policies. Although we are not suggesting that police depart-\nments should adopt mandatory arrest policies for sexual assault cases, they\nshould make an arrest when there is sufficient evidence that a crime occurred\nand that the suspect is the person who committed the crime.\nClearly, there are cases where the police cannot--indeed should not--make\nan arrest. If probable cause to arrest does not exist or if the prosecutor rejects\nthe case for further investigation as a result of a pre-arrest screening process,\nthe case should be left open and investigated further. These cases should not\nbe cleared by exceptional means, as they do not meet the UCR criterion that\nthere must be \"enough information to support an arrest, charge, and turning\nover to the court for prosecution.\" The case cannot be solved--that is,\ncleared--if probable cause to make an arrest does not exist. Cases in which\nthe police know who and where the suspect is and in which probable cause\nexists to make an arrest, but the victim refuses to cooperate with the police\ncan legitimately be cleared by exceptional means if the victim's lack of coop-\neration means that the police cannot make an arrest.\nWe believe that our study, which was conducted in one of the largest and\nmost diverse cities in the United States, makes important theoretical and\nmethodological contributions to our understanding of police and prosecutorial\ndecision-making. However, our approach is not without limitations, the most\nimportant of which stems from our reliance on the information contained in\nofficial case files. Although we were provided with redacted copies of all docu-\nments in the case files, the material contained in the files ultimately reflects\nthe perceptions and biases of individual law enforcement officers, who\ndescribe the incident, recount the victim's allegations, and document the\nresults of interviews with victims, witnesses, and suspects. Although we have\nno reason to believe that their accounts were slanted or written in such a way\nas to make the department \"look good,\" there is obviously a possibility of \"bi-\nased reporting,\" which we cannot measure or take into consideration.\nConclusion\nLike prior researchers, we began our project on police and prosecutorial deci-\nsion-making in sexual assault cases with an assumption that law enforcement's\ndecision to arrest and the district attorney's decision to file charges were sep-\narate decisions that reflected different standards of proof and different deci-\nsion rules. We recognized that prosecutors' filing decisions would be based in\npart on the adequacy of the investigation conducted by law enforcement and\non the willingness of the victim to cooperate, which, in turn, would be\naffected by the handling of the case by the IO. We also recognized that the\nIO's decision to arrest or not might reflect to some extent his/her beliefs\nabout the likelihood of successful prosecution. However, we did not expect to\nfind that the decision to arrest the suspect or not would in many cases be de-\ntermined by the prosecutor's evaluation of the case or that a substantial pro-\nportion of cases would be rejected for prosecution prior to the arrest of the\nsuspect.\nThe findings of our study illuminate the ways in which the decisions of police\nand prosecutors overlap and influence one another. Our findings also illustrate\nthat, at least in the context of sexual assault, it is misleading to assume that\ndata on cases cleared by arrest accurately reflect police arrest decisions and\nthat data on cases that were evaluated for charging following the arrest of the\nsuspect accurately capture prosecutors' charging decisions. More importantly,\nour findings illustrate that the conclusions we draw about the factors that\ninfluence sexual assault case outcomes depend to some extent on the concep-\ntualization and operationalization of decisions to arrest and charge. Our\nresearch has attempted to disentangle these complicated relationships in one\njurisdiction and with respect to one type of crime. Future research should\nfocus on determining whether these overlapping decision rules are found in\nother jurisdictions and for other types of crimes.\nIt is also important to point out that the findings of our study confirm what\nresearch conducted 30 or 40 years ago revealed about the response of the\ncriminal justice system to the crime of sexual assault. Although legally rele-\nvant indicators of crime seriousness and evidentiary strength predicted\nwhether the suspect would be arrested and charged, legally irrelevant victim\ncharacteristics also played a role. The rape reform movement and more recent\nattention to the problematic nature of attrition in sexual assault cases\nnotwithstanding, police and prosecutors continue to make decisions based at\nleast in part on their assessments of the victim's character, reputation, behav-\nior at the time of the incident, and motivation for reporting. This suggests that\nstereotypes about real rapes and genuine victims have endured and that they\ncontinue to negatively affect the likelihood of arrest and successful prosecu-\ntion of those who commit this violent crime.\n"
