Two related literatures on the topic have emerged--\nthe intergroup interaction literature and the intergroup contact literature--in which divergent conclusions have\nbeen reported. Intergroup interaction is typically found to have negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing\nheightened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have\npositive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and lower prejudice. We examine these\nparadoxical findings, proposing that researchers contributing to the two literatures are examining different levels\nof the same phenomenon and that methodological differences can account for the divide between the literatures.\nFurther, we introduce a mathematical model by which the findings of the two literatures can be reconciled.

Two related literatures on the topic of\nintergroup interactions have emerged: the intergroup\ninteraction literature and the intergroup contact literature.\nAlthough intergroup interaction and intergroup contact\nessentially have the same definition (i.e., social interaction\namong members of different groups),1 the two literatures\nyield contradictory conclusions when it comes to whether\nintergroup interactions positively or negatively impact\nintergroup relations. In the present article, we use the term\nintergroup bias as an overarching construct that represents\nrelatively negative beliefs (e.g., stereotypes), feelings/eval-\nuations (e.g., prejudice), and behaviors (e.g., discrimina-\ntion) toward an outgroup. Although multifaceted, the term\nintergroup bias is used to represent general negativity\ntoward outgroups. Intergroup interaction is typically found\nto exacerbate intergroup bias, producing heightened\nstress, anxiety, or outgroup avoidance (Shelton, Dovidio,\nHebl, & Richeson, 2009; Trawalter, Richeson, & Shelton,\n2009). Intergroup contact, however, is typically found to\nreduce intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxi-\nety and lower prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). The\nparadoxical nature of these findings is rarely recognized\nand has yet to be systematically examined. We propose\nthat methodological differences may account for this\ndivide and that these two literatures can be integrated by\nconsidering an overall model of negotiating intergroup\nexperience over time.

However,\nthese two constructs have not been rigorously disambig-\nuated in either the contact or interaction literatures,\nincluding some notable examples of a complete merging\nof the two constructs (Wilder & Thompson, 1980). We\nsee these constructs as naturally conflated, but they\nnonetheless have disambiguating features.\nIn intergroup interaction studies, researchers typically\nexamine short interactions between ingroup and outgroup\nmembers. By design, these studies are typically stranger\ninteractions (i.e., neither participant knows each other)\nthat take place in a laboratory setting. These interactions\nare often structured or guided by researchers, in which\ninteraction partners complete tasks such as playing a party\ngame (Blascovich et al., 2001) or answering questions pro-\nvided by researchers (Avery et al., 2009; Hyers & Swim,\nsome cases, however, these interactions are unstructured\n(Ickes, 1984), which has the potential to amplify anxiety\nthe interaction, the quality of the interaction and its down-\nstream consequences are measured subjectively (e.g., self-\nbehaviorally (Plant & Devine, 2003; Richeson & Shelton,\nPage-Gould et al., 2008). In the majority of these studies,\nresearchers have examined interactions among people\nbelonging to different ethnic or racial groups (i.e., interra-\nKumhyr, 2001; but for an exception, see Blascovich et al.,\nGenerally, these studies demonstrate that intergroup\ninteractions produce negative outcomes for individuals,\nsuch as anxiety and discomfort. People report that they\nfeel anxious during intergroup interactions (i.e., inter-\nanticipating intergroup interactions can induce concerns\nabout being viewed negatively by one's partner (Vorauer,\nHunter, Main, & Roy, 2000) and avoidance of the interac-\ntion, which is detrimental for the individual as well as\nsociety at large (Mallett et al., 2008; Plant & Devine,\n2003). Actually engaging in these interactions can pro-\nShelton, 2003), a threatened social identity (Shelton,\nRicheson, & Vorauer, 2006), and patterns of physiological\nresponses consistent with threat (Blascovich et al., 2001;\nsion from the intergroup interaction literature is that\nintergroup interactions are stressful and anxiety-provok-\ning and that these reactions predict increased intergroup\nbias (Paolini, Hewstone, Voci, Harwood, & Cairns, 2006).\nThe findings from intergroup contact studies, how-\never, typically reflect long-term contact with outgroup\nmembers (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Most often, partici-\npants provide self-reports of the quantity and quality of\ninteractions they have had with outgroup members.\nSome measures of intergroup contact specify the content\nof the intergroup interactions (e.g., \"How often have you\nhad informal conversations with . . .\"; Islam & Hewstone,\n1993), but many intergroup contact measures are\ndesigned to assess the quantity of intergroup contact\nwithout regard to the content or goal of the intergroup\ninteractions that comprised the contact (Harwood,\nHewstone, Paolini, & Voci, 2005). Typically, researchers\nof these studies aim to estimate the association between\nthis contact and some form of intergroup bias (e.g., prej-\nudice, intergroup anxiety, discriminatory behavior).\nWhen intergroup contact is actually observed rather than\nassessed through self-reports, the contact is typically\nstructured or guided by researchers (Barnard & Benn,\nin some cases, observed contact is allowed to be unstruc-\ntured (Shook & Fazio, 2008). Several types of intergroup\ncontact have been examined, including contact among\npeople with dissimilarities in race (Dhont & Van Hiel,\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 309\nIntergroup contact studies portray a positive picture of\nhow intergroup interactions relate to intergroup bias.\nAcross hundreds of studies, there is a consistent, small\nnegative relationship between intergroup contact and\nsuggesting that contact is beneficial for individuals, inter-\npersonal relations, and society overall. Contrasting the\nheightened anxiety observed in intergroup interactions,\ncontact studies typically demonstrate that intergroup con-\ntact is associated with less intergroup anxiety (Islam &\nVoci & Hewstone, 2003) and more positive attitudes\ntoward outgroups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Moreover,\nlower intergroup anxiety explains some of the relation-\nship between contact and lower prejudice (Binder et al.,\n& Hewstone, 2003), and lower prejudice also leads to\nincreased contact (Binder et al., 2009). Overall, therefore,\nthe negative relationship between intergroup contact and\nintergroup bias is explained in part through the promo-\ntion of positive intergroup interactions.\nAt first glance, it appears as if studies on intergroup\ninteraction and intergroup contact contradict each other,\nbut this is simply a matter of scale. An intergroup interac-\ntion is the atomic unit of intergroup contact. People who\nhave any degree of intergroup contact (e.g., ranging from\nnone at all to daily) can engage in an intergroup interac-\ntion, but not all people who find themselves in intergroup\ninteractions would be said to have much intergroup con-\ntact. It is possible that people at the low end of intergroup\ncontact are pulling down the average quality of intergroup\ninteractions. In other words, when a person has his or her\nfirst few intergroup interactions, his or her experiences\nmay be quite variable. After a certain critical number of\ngood intergroup interactions have occurred, then subse-\nquent intergroup interactions are likely to be positive\npositive intergroup interactions improve intergroup atti-\ntudes (Paolini et al., 2006). That is, we predict that after\nsomeone has reached a certain degree of intergroup con-\ntact, then the small linear relationship observed across the\nintergroup contact literature (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006) will\ndescribe the relationship between intergroup interactions\nand intergroup bias. We label this the contact threshold\n(which we elaborate on later). In other words, there may\nbe short-term \"costs\" to intergroup interactions (e.g.,\nheightened anxiety) but long-term intergroup gains (e.g.,\nlower prejudice). People may reach a point or threshold\nwhereby intergroup interactions are no longer costly to\nindividuals or society at large but are, instead, beneficial\nfor intergroup relations.\nAccounting for the Divide\nAlthough the terms intergroup interaction and intergroup\ncontact have been used interchangeably--and not erro-\nneously so--their differing conclusions suggest that they\nare capturing two distinct processes. We propose that this\nis because different levels of the same phenomenon are\nbeing examined in the two literatures. Concomitant with\nthis difference in scale, studies on intergroup interaction\nand intergroup contact systematically differ in their meth-\nodological approaches. As a result, one or more interre-\nlated methodological differences between the two\nliteratures, as we discuss later, may account for their\ndivergent conclusions (see Table 1 for a summary of\nthese differences).\nContext\nThe dominant study designs in the intergroup interaction\nand intergroup contact literatures--experimental and\ncross-sectional, respectively--may partially account for\nthe divide between the two literatures. Next, we discuss\ntwo potential reasons for this.\nArtificial versus real-life setting. Intergroup interac-\ntions in the laboratory are inherently artificial because\nthe experimenter stages them. When people are report-\ning their intergroup contact, however, they are most\nlikely reflecting on real intergroup interactions that\noccurred and progressed naturally. Although the experi-\nmental control afforded in laboratory-based intergroup\ninteraction studies provides superior evidence for causal\ninference, it also limits ecological validity (see Blascovich\net al., 2002, for discussion of more ecologically valid,\nlaboratory-based approaches). Intergroup interactions in\nartificial settings may produce more negative outcomes\n(e.g., stress, anxiety) than those occurring in more natu-\nral settings because laboratory participants (a) may have\nfew past contact experiences, (b) have no control over\nthe laboratory situation (Amat et al., 2005; S. Cohen,\n1980), (c) may experience evaluation apprehension\n(Weber & Cook, 1972), and (d) may typically avoid inter-\ngroup interactions in everyday life (Mallett et al., 2008).\nIn other words, those self-reporting more intergroup con-\ntact are likely to be lower in intergroup anxiety and less\nlikely to avoid intergroup contact, whereas participants in\nlaboratory studies may have little past contact and may\neven actively avoid intergroup interactions until they find\nthemselves in the anxiety-provoking laboratory setting,\ninflating the negative effects observed.\nIndeed, laboratory-based intergroup interactions pro-\nduce threat reactions primarily among those with little\nintergroup contact, with those reporting more intergroup\ncontact experiencing less threat (Blascovich et al., 2001).\nSome evidence also suggests that intergroup contact not\nonly reduces intergroup anxiety but that intergroup anxi-\nety reduces intergroup contact (Swart, Hewstone, Christ,\n& Voci, 2011), suggesting a selection bias consistent with\nthe observed bidirectional association between inter-\ngroup contact and intergroup bias (Binder et al., 2009;\nSwart et al., 2011; but for an exception, see van Laar,\nLevin, Sinclair, & Sidanius, 2005). Further, given the\napparent anxiety plaguing intergroup interactions\n(Shelton et al., 2009), increased anxiety and conflict\nwould be expected in real-life intergroup versus ingroup\ninteractions. This main effect of intergroup context on\nanxiety and conflict, however, is only sometimes observed\nin longitudinal studies of intergroup interactions (cf.\nCook, Calcagno, Arrow, & Malle, 2012, and Shelton et al.,\npeople who are prone to anxiety in intergroup interac-\ntions avoid these interactions, then most intergroup inter-\nactions that occur outside the laboratory may be among\npeople who are least apprehensive about intergroup\ninteractions. It is possible that, in the real world, inter-\ngroup interactions may not be any more stressful than\ningroup interactions because (a) the people who are\nstressed by intergroup interactions avoid them and (b)\nthe people who are not stressed by intergroup interac-\ntions approach them because they are equipped to han-\ndle any negativity that may arise (Page-Gould, 2012;\nPage-Gould, Mendes, & Major, 2010; Paolini et al., in\npress).2 Of course, when real-life intergroup interactions\nare not easily avoidable, evidence suggests that they are\nindeed more stressful than ingroup interactions (Shelton et\nextent that people can avoid intergroup interactions in\neveryday life, then this avoidance will likely not occur ran-\ndomly (i.e., the people who elect to avoid will be those\nwith low intergroup contact and high intergroup anxiety,\nwhereas the people who choose to have intergroup inter-\nactions will be people that tend to have more positive inter-\nactions). Therefore, it is possible that natural (unavoidable)\nintergroup interactions are just as stressful as laboratory-\nobserved intergroup interactions for people who are prone\nto negative responses to intergroup interactions through\nprejudice or intergroup anxiety, but these may be avoided\nwhen feasible. Simply put, it may be that most naturally\noccurring intergroup interactions are positive and facilitate\nongoing reductions in intergroup bias, because contact\nbegets contact, so they are occurring mainly among people\nwho elect to have those types of interactions.\nSusceptibility to demand characteristics. In within-\nsubjects designs, participants have all the information\nthey need to guess the researcher's hypothesis because\nthey are presented with all the constructs that are rele-\nvant to the hypothesis. In contrast, in between-subjects\ndesigns, participants only know the conditions that they\nwere randomly assigned to receive. Thus, participants in\nwithin-subjects research have greater amounts of infor-\nmation, on the basis of which they are likely better able\nto accurately guess the researcher's hypothesis. Correla-\ntional research (i.e., in which there is no experimental\nmanipulation) is akin to a within-subjects design, as all\nparticipants are exposed to the same information.\nApplied to research on intergroup interactions and con-\ntact, between-subjects designs do not give access to the\ninformation needed to know that the intergroup context of\nthe social interaction or intergroup contact was\nTable 1.

There are exceptions, as discussed in the article.\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 311\nbeing systematically manipulated. It is more likely, then,\nthat participants may report less anxiety, less bias, and\nmore contact in within-subjects studies relative to between-\nsubjects studies because participants can more accurately\ninfer the hypotheses. However, accurate suspicion is cer-\ntainly possible in between-subjects designs (Vorauer,\nMartens, & Sasaki, 2009). All the same, it comes down to\ninformation: The hypothesis in much of intergroup rela-\ntions research is concealed because the research topic is\ntypically controversial. Participants have access to all varia-\ntions of the independent variables in within-subjects\ndesigns, but they will see at least one independent vari-\nable as being invariant in between-subjects designs.\nResearch on intergroup interaction has relied less on\n\nsurvey and within-subjects designs than research on inter-\ngroup contact, despite plenty of examples of between-\nsubjects designs in intergroup contact research. Of course,\nthe measurement of contact itself cannot be solely attribut-\nable to demand characteristics or controlled responding\nbecause observer reports suggest that self-reports of inter-\ngroup contact are accurate (Hewstone, Judd, & Sharp,\n2011) and that socially desirable responding is a concern\nin all studies in which intergroup bias is assessed. We sug-\ngest, however, that socially desirable responding is greater\nin survey and within-subjects studies, which are more com-\nmon in the intergroup contact than intergroup interaction\nliteratures. Nevertheless, we want to emphasize that many\nintergroup contact studies have used other methods than\nself-reports (Barnard & Benn, 1987; Clunies Ross & O'Meara,\ninteraction studies take place in the laboratory (Shelton\nFrequency\nResearchers of intergroup interaction studies typically\nobserve intergroup interaction on a single occasion\nKumhyr, 2001), whereas intergroup contact is typically\noperationalized as the quantity of intergroup interactions\nor even close cross-group relationships that a person has\nor has had in his or her past (Islam & Hewstone, 1993;\nintergroup interactions may produce more positive indi-\nvidual, interpersonal, and societal outcomes than occa-\nsional intergroup interactions for a number of reasons.\nNumber of interactions.Intergroup interactions\nmanipulated in the laboratory could be a rare event in\nthe life of someone who is low in intergroup contact\nwhile being more natural to someone who has a rela-\ntively high degree of past intergroup contact. Naturally\noccurring intergroup interactions are more likely for peo-\nple with a high degree of past contact. Therefore, experi-\nences during laboratory intergroup interactions may be\nquite variable because they could be either a person's\nfirst intergroup interaction or his or her thousandth inter-\ngroup interaction. Supporting the idea that frequent\ninteractions facilitate the positive effects of intergroup\ncontact, researchers of studies involving multiple inter-\ngroup interactions have observed a greater reduction in\nintergroup bias compared with a single intergroup inter-\naction (Barnard & Benn, 1987; Clunies Ross & O'Meara,\n& Sommers, 2012). Cross-group friendships, which by\ndefinition involve multiple intergroup interactions as a\nfriendship develops, are especially effective in reducing\nintergroup bias (Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew, & Wright,\n2011). More frequent intergroup interactions may attenu-\nate the use of group stereotypes (Shelton & Richeson,\n2006), encouraging more intimate and personalized inter-\nactions and hence less intergroup bias (Brewer & Miller,\nintergroup interactions also equips people with the social\nskills and resources to appraise intergroup interactions as\nnonstressful (Mendes, Blascovich, Hunter, Lickel, & Jost,\n2007), which can promote subsequent intergroup contact\nand more positive intergroup relations (Page-Gould,\nInteraction duration.Intergroup interaction studies\ntypically involve short interactions among group mem-\nbers (e.g., often lasting less than 10 min; Avery et al.,\nford et al., 2005), whereas intergroup contact studies are\nbetter able to measure contact among group members\nthat lasts for a longer period of time (e.g., meetings that\nlast for hours, long-term close relationships; Islam &\n2012). Interacting with an outgroup member for a long\nduration may result in less intergroup bias by facilitating\nbonding (Wright, Aron, & Tropp, 2002; Wright, Brody, &\nAron, 2005) or the adoption of the outgroup member's\nperspective, which is associated with lower intergroup\nanxiety (Aberson & Haag, 2007). Relative to longer term\nintergroup contact, an interaction lasting only a few min-\nutes may not provide enough time to achieve these out-\ncomes. Although under certain circumstances less\nintergroup bias has been observed following relatively\nshort intergroup interactions (Gaertner et al., 1999; Grack\n& Richman, 1996), we suggest that longer duration inter-\nactions are likely to have the most positive impact on\nintergroup bias, especially when these interactions occur\nrepeatedly as per the preceding section on interaction\nfrequency. We expect that the relationship between\ninteraction duration and intergroup bias is linear overall,\nbut we recognize that, like any time-based process (S. G.\nWest & Hepworth, 1991), this linear trend will only be\napparent in the long run, after short-term, periodic\nincreases and decreases have been taken into account.\nFamiliarity.\nIntergroup interaction studies typically\ninvolve an anticipated or actual interaction with an\nunknown outgroup member (i.e., a stranger), whereas\nintergroup contact measures do not commonly distin-\nguish between contact with both known and unknown\noutgroup members. Outcomes are more likely to be posi-\ntive when the outgroup member is familiar because the\ninteraction partner is more readily predictable and inter-\npretable. A more predictable partner is less threatening\nand less anxiety-provoking than an unpredictable out-\ngroup member (Mendes et al., 2007). Moreover, when\npeople judge their current and previous intergroup con-\ntact, they likely consider familiar people more than unfa-\nmiliar people, given the chronic salience of close others\n(Andersen, Glassman, Chen, & Cole, 1995). Thus, research\non intergroup contact captures variance in partner famil-\niarity. For example, someone could have a lot of interre-\nligious contact because (a) he or she has family members\nwho practice different religions, and therefore he or she\ninteracts repeatedly with the same outgroup members, or\n(b) he or she holds a retail job in a religiously diverse\ncommunity and interacts repeatedly with many different\noutgroup strangers. By contrast, in intergroup interaction\nresearch, the partner is almost always unfamiliar.\nExperience.Participants in intergroup interaction stud-\nies may have less experience interacting with outgroup\nmembers because the interaction could be one of their\nfirst intergroup interactions. By default, participants who\nreport more contact in intergroup contact studies have\nprior experience with intergroup interactions. Intergroup\nexperience may promote positive outcomes for individu-\nals in new intergroup interactions by making these inter-\nactions equally predictable as ingroup interactions. When\ninteractions are predictable versus unpredictable, they\nare less demanding and less stressful (Bettencourt, Dill,\nGreathouse, Charlton, & Mulholland, 1997; Mendes et al.,\n2007). This may partially account for the increased anxi-\nety observed in intergroup interactions relative to inter-\ngroup contact.\nOutcome measures\nIntergroup interaction and intergroup contact studies\ntypically are concerned with different overall questions,\nand thus, different outcomes are assessed. First, research-\ners of intergroup interaction studies typically use state-\nlevel outcome measures (e.g., measuring how anxious\nparticipants feel during the interaction), whereas\nresearchers of intergroup contact studies typically use\ntrait-level measures (e.g., measuring participants' general\nexpectations of anxiety during intergroup interactions).\nSecond, researchers of intergroup interaction studies typ-\nically focus on self-relevant intrapsychic or individual\noutcomes (e.g., one's emotional reactions), whereas\nresearchers of intergroup contact studies focus on other-\nrelevant or societal outcomes (e.g., intergroup attitudes).\nThird, researchers of intergroup interaction studies typi-\ncally compare these outcomes in intergroup interactions\nwith those observed in same-group interactions, but most\nresearchers of intergroup contact studies assess inter-\ngroup contact without comparisons with ingroup con-\ntact. Integrating across the literatures, participants may\nexperience changes in state affect during a single inter-\ngroup interaction, but as a whole, intergroup interactions\nmay lessen anticipatory intergroup anxiety at the trait\nlevel. That is, intergroup interactions may have short-\nterm, self-relevant costs but long-term, other-relevant\ngains.\nThere are a number of notable exceptions to the typi-\ncal set of outcome measures used in each literature. Many\nresearchers of intergroup interaction studies have\nassessed trait-level or intergroup outcomes, and many\nresearchers of intergroup contact studies have assessed\nstate-level or intrapsychic outcomes. For example,\nSinclair, Lowery, Hardin, and Colangelo (2005) found that\ninterracial interactions reduced racial bias; Trawalter,\nAdam, Chase-Lansdale, and Richeson (2012) found that\nintergroup contact can be associated with increased per-\nsonal stress; and Trail et al. (2009) found that students\nengaging in intergroup versus same-group contact expe-\nrienced less positive emotions. These findings suggest\nthat the typical outcome measures examined within each\nliterature may account for their seemingly paradoxical\nfindings.\nIntergroup domain\nIntergroup interactions typically involve an interaction\nwith a racial or ethnic outgroup member (for reviews, see\nBlack interracial interactions (Toosi et al., 2012).\nIntergroup contact studies, however, have examined con-\ntact with a broader range of outgroup targets. In their\ncomprehensive meta-analysis of intergroup contact,\nexamined contact with a racial or ethnic outgroup mem-\nber, whereas the remaining samples examined contact\nwith another type of outgroup member (e.g., including\ncontact with older adults, people with dissimilar sexual\norientation, people with mental illness, and people with\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 313\ndisabilities). However, the effect size for intergroup con-\ntact was small and negative for all outgroup targets exam-\nined, with interracial contact having essentially the same\neffect size (i.e., Pearson's r = -.21) as the effect size across\nall forms of contact (i.e., r = -.21; Pettigrew & Tropp,\n2006). Thus, it is possible that research in which intereth-\nnic relations are examined is reasonably generalizable to\nother intergroup domains.\nThe impact of target group may have downstream\nconsequences for the quality of intergroup interactions,\nall the same. As laboratory intergroup interactions have\nalmost exclusively involved nonconcealable groups (e.g.,\nethnicity, sex), participants in these studies had immedi-\nate awareness of the intergroup nature of the interaction,\npotentially evoking intergroup anxiety (Stephan &\ncase of concealable groups. When the intergroup nature\nof an interaction is not readily apparent (e.g., sexual ori-\nentation or religious outgroups), as may have been the\ncase for some interactions reported by participants in\nintergroup contact studies, this interaction may be\napproached as an ingroup interaction. Hence, the inter-\naction may not generate intergroup anxiety and negativ-\nity, at least not upfront (Buck & Plant, 2011; Kaufman &\ntion, see MacInnis & Hodson, 2014). It may also be that\ninterracial interactions are simply more stressful than\nother types of intergroup interactions (Critcher, Mazziotta,\nDovidio, & Brown, in preparation). Regardless, the pro-\nportion of different intergroup domains examined across\nthe intergroup interaction and intergroup contact litera-\ntures may account for their differing conclusions.\nIntegrating the Literatures\nOverall, the intergroup interaction literature demonstrates\nthat, in the short term, contact with outgroup members has\na negative impact on intergroup bias, producing height-\nened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance\nintergroup contact literature demonstrates that intergroup\ninteractions have a positive impact on intergroup bias in\nthe long run, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and\nlower prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Considering\nthe methodological differences between the two literatures\nnoted earlier, we introduce a novel model by which these\nseemingly paradoxical findings can be unified. Specifically,\nwe propose that one's first intergroup interaction with a\nstranger is anxiety-provoking, with some exceptions (e.g.,\nthose high in self-expansion motives; Wright et al., 2002),\nconsistent with the intergroup interaction literature (Littleford\nety leads to the avoidance of subsequent intergroup\nStephan, Ybarra, Martinez, Schwarzwald, & Tur-Kaspa,\n1998). We propose that if subsequent intergroup interac-\ntions occur, however, that stress and anxiety are progres-\nsively reduced (Page-Gould et al., 2008; White &\nAbu-Rayya, 2012). Engaging in these subsequent interac-\ntions promotes the building of resources to cope with\nstressful intergroup interactions (Mendes et al., 2002; Page-\net al., 2009) and increases the familiarity of intergroup\ninteractions, which also likely reduces the stress of inter-\ngroup interactions (Mendes et al., 2007). At some point, a\nthreshold will be reached whereby a person's history of\nintergroup interactions assumes the properties of inter-\ngroup contact. That is, intergroup interactions eventually\nproduce positive outcomes, such as less intergroup anxi-\nety and more positive intergroup attitudes (Binder et al.,\noutcomes are maintained through the ongoing facilitation\nof positive intergroup interactions by past intergroup\ncontact.\nEssentially, we posit that a threshold in experience\nwith intergroup interactions is reached whereby the ini-\ntially negative effect of intergroup interactions on inter-\ngroup bias progressively approaches the inverse linear\nrelationship estimated from the intergroup contact litera-\nture (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Similar thresholds have\nbeen described in the field of organizational behavior.\nFor example, according to critical mass theory, when a\nminority group reaches a certain size (e.g., ranging from\n10% to 35% of a larger society), a qualitative change\noccurs whereby the previously conforming minority\ngroup members become influential and assertive within\nthe larger society (Studlar & McAllister, 2002). Similarly,\nsome support has been demonstrated (P. B. Jackson,\nThoits, & Taylor, 1995; Stichman, Hassell, & Archbold,\nthat workplaces marked by group conflicts become\nmore harmonious when the proportion of employees\nfrom historically underrepresented groups reaches a tip-\nping point of 15%. In the specific context of historically\nmale-dominated symphony orchestras, Allmendinger\nand Hackman (1995) found that several outcomes,\nincluding relationship quality, steadily worsened as the\nproportion of women in the orchestra increased. As the\nproportion of women approached a threshold of 50%,\nhowever, orchestra functioning no longer decreased,\nand for some outcome measures, it improved. Compar\nable with these group composition thresholds, we pro-\npose that there are many objective and subjective factors\nthat lead to individual variance in the onset of the con-\ntact threshold we describe, which provides many ave-\nnues for future research.\nThe Limiting Function of Intergroup\nInteraction and Intergroup Contact\nUltimately, we posit that intergroup contact reflects the\nstate of intergroup bias as the number of intergroup inter-\nactions approaches infinity. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006)\npredicted that the impact of intergroup contact on preju-\ndice reduction would eventually asymptote, essentially\nreflecting the idea that intergroup contact can only keep\nreducing prejudice while a person still has prejudice to\nreduce. We build off this work by proposing that the linear\nrelationship between intergroup interactions and inter-\ngroup bias is itself asymptotic. Specifically, as a person\ncontinues to have more intergroup interactions, the rela-\ntionship between this past contact and intergroup bias\ntakes the form of an oblique asymptote, which is a slanted\nlinear asymptote (Howison, 2005; see Figure 1). The\nasymptote reflects the well-established negative associa-\ntion between intergroup contact and intergroup bias (i.e.,\nthat approaches the asymptote reflects the volatile rela-\ntionship between intergroup interactions and intergroup\nbias when intergroup interactions are close to zero. When\nintergroup interaction quantity is low, the association\nbetween intergroup interactions and intergroup bias will\nbe quite variable. As intergroup interactions increase, the\nassociation between intergroup interactions and inter-\ngroup bias becomes more reliable and consistent with\nrelations observed in the intergroup contact literature.\nFor Figure 1, the asymptote is plotted with the\nequation,\ny Default Intergroup Bias\nContact Effect x\n= ( ) +\n( )\u00d7 ,\nwhere y represents intergroup bias; the intercept, Default\nIntergroup Bias, is a constant that represents the default\nlevel of intergroup bias in the absence of any intergroup\ncontact; and the Contact Effect is the slope, which repre-\nsents the relationship between intergroup contact and\nintergroup bias. For the purposes of this article, we\nassume the Contact Effect is equivalent to the effect size\nfor contact that has been estimated through meta-analysis\ncount of a person's lifetime intergroup interactions. The\nintercept of the asymptote is expected to vary depending\non the intergroup bias outcome measure used (e.g.,\nimplicit attitudes, behavioral intentions) and its measure-\nment scale (e.g., bias measured with a 100-point feeling\nthermometer may use an intercept of 35; bias measured\nwith an implicit associations test may use an intercept of\nD = .7). Given its meta-analytic origins, we chose to use\nlation that represents the small but reliable association\nbetween intergroup contact and prejudice as the stan-\ndardized slope of intergroup interactions predicting inter-\ngroup bias. Of course, the asymptote may vary when\nzeroing in on a specific intergroup domain (e.g., r = -.27\nfor contact with heterosexual\u00adhomosexual people; r =\n-.24 for contact with people with physical disabilities;\nand r = -.18 for contact with older adults; Pettigrew &\nFigure 1, given that it represents the mean effect size\nacross group domains, recognizing the limitation that\ninterracial interactions were examined in 51% of the stud-\nies in Pettigrew and Tropp's meta-analysis. Further, we\nrecognize that prejudice is only one component of inter-\ngroup bias (e.g., stereotyping and discrimination being\nother components) and that the slope of the asymptote\nmay also vary depending on the measure of intergroup\nbias used. Although we recognize that differences in\ndefault levels of intergroup bias will exist across different\ntypes of outcomes, we expect that the association between\nintergroup contact and other forms of intergroup bias is\ngenerally similar (i.e., reliably negative and small).\nAfter hundreds of studies and thousands of partici-\npants, we believe that the fields of intergroup contact and\nintergroup interaction are both sufficiently rich. At this\nFig. 1.Graph representing the relationship between intergroup inter-\nactions and intergroup bias as an oblique asymptote. The dashed line\nrepresents the oblique asymptote. The dotted line represents the curve\nfunction under good conditions (e.g., multiple high-quality interactions\nwith the same outgroup member with little time between interactions).\nThe dotted-and-dashed line represents the curve under relatively poorer\nconditions (e.g., superficial interactions with different group members\nwith a long time period between interactions). The solid line represents\nthe curve function on average.\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 315\npoint, researchers in the field can benefit from formaliz-\ning our knowledge. This equation could be used to pro-\nspectively predict intergroup bias at varying amounts of\nintergroup interactions. However, as represented by the\ncurve function that approaches the oblique asymptote,\nwe expect that the relationship between intergroup inter-\nactions and intergroup bias is neither linear nor homosce-\ndastic, such that early intergroup interactions are likely to\nproduce more variable and more negative individual and\nsocietal outcomes. Thus, we propose that the true rela-\ntionship between intergroup interactions and intergroup\nbias is curvilinear, approaching a linear relationship as\nintergroup interactions approach infinity. The contact\nthreshold is the point at which the tangents of this curve\nfunction become effectively parallel to the oblique\nasymptote.\nWe hypothesize a general form for the curve function\nto be as follows:\ny Contact Effect x Default Intergroup Bias\nx Rate x\n= \u00d7 + ( )\n\u00d7 + -\n[\n] / (\nwhere y and x represent the same variables as in Equation\n1 (i.e., intergroup bias and the count of a person's life-\ntime intergroup interactions, respectively), and Rate rep-\nresents the rate at which intergroup interactions\nprogressively approach the asymptote. This rate param-\neter is analogous to the degree to which a single interac-\ntion leads to a proportional decrease in intergroup bias,\nand we suspect that the rate parameter is most directly\naffected by contact quality, although we later discuss the\nrole of contact quality along with other factors affecting\nthe rate parameter. Figure 1 depicts this curvilinear func-\ntion with three different rate parameters of Rate = 10\n(dotted line), Rate = 100 (solid line), and Rate = 500 (dot-\nted-and-dashed line) to represent higher, average, and\nlower quality interactions leading to faster, average, and\nslower routes to the contact threshold, respectively. That\nis, each curve will eventually become effectively parallel\nto the -.21 slope but each at a different rate. Each curve\ncan be considered effectively parallel at the point where\nthe discrepancy between the curve and the asymptote\ncannot be disambiguated from the reliability of the mea-\nsures used. Although we believe that interaction quantity\nand quality cannot be divorced from one another, with\neach dimension augmenting and amplifying the other,\nwe expect the rate parameter to be heavily influenced by\nquality of interactions. If interactions are of higher qual-\nity, the rate parameter will be smaller; if interactions are\nof lower quality, the rate parameter will be larger. All the\nsame, our model predicts that being \"high\" on quantity or\nquality can result in reaching the contact threshold, even\nin the absence of the other (but see Barlow et al., 2012;\nTrail et al., 2009). However, we expect that the contact\nthreshold will be reached most quickly when both con-\ntact quantity and quality are optimized, which may be\nwhy close intergroup relationships, such as cross-group\nfriendship, are more strongly related to intergroup con-\nThe numerical constants in the curve function also\nhave semantic meaning and should be amended through\nempiricism. Two of the numbers are necessary to force\nthe function to approach the asymptote as intergroup\ninteractions increase to infinity: -0.21 is the slope of the\nasymptote, and we have plotted our example figures with\nan outcome measure on a 0\u00ad100 scale of intergroup bias\nand with 35 as the intercept of the asymptote, arbitrarily\non the basis of values reported on a feeling thermometer\nby Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001). The denominator in\nEquation 2 represents the stochastic nature of intergroup\ninteractions. By subtracting the constant of \"1\" from the\ncurrent number of intergroup interactions, two specific\npurposes are served: (a) A vertical asymptote is created\nat the first intergroup interaction, suggesting that we can-\nnot predict how the first intergroup interaction a person\never has will relate to his or her intergroup bias; (b) sym-\nbolically, this also represents that the current intergroup\ninteraction is a function of the number of intergroup\ninteractions a person has previously had in his or her\nlifetime.\nNote that we are not necessarily proposing an asymp-\ntote at \"zero\" prejudice like Pettigrew and Tropp (2006)\ndid. Although we expect that the zero point is rarely\ncrossed, we want to allow for the possibility that inter-\ngroup bias and perceived group membership can entirely\nshift in favor of outgroups (e.g., expatriates who chose to\nlive in a different culture solely for internal reasons). Our\nmodel predicts that the state at which a person begins to\nally with outgroups more than ingroups will only be\nobserved at the higher end of the intergroup contact con-\ntinuum; however, we suspect that this exceptional behav-\nior is driven as much if not more by social experiences\nwith ingroup members than with outgroup members.\nAltogether, the curve function (Equation 2) reflects the\nhypothesized relationship between intergroup interac-\ntions and intergroup bias in natural data, and the oblique\nasymptote (Equation 1) represents the relationship\nbetween intergroup interactions and intergroup bias as\nintergroup interactions approach infinity. We generally\nplot these functions on an axis representing contact\nquantity because intergroup interactions are discrete,\nobservable events in a person's life. However, we expect\nthat contact quality, which is inherently subjective, is one\nof the primary contributors to the rate parameter in the\ncurve function. Putting these ideas together, using our\nmodel we predict that contact quantity is the primary\ndimension that determines whether a person's intergroup\ninteractions reflect processes of intergroup contact, but\ncontact quality more strongly determines how each inter-\ngroup interaction affects intergroup bias and advances a\nperson toward the contact threshold. Future research is\nnecessary to determine factors influencing the speed at\nwhich one reaches the contact threshold (i.e., when the\nslope of the curve becomes almost parallel to the oblique\nasymptote) and, thus, to determine these actual values.\nNext, we discuss such potential factors as well as means\nby which to detect the threshold itself.\nExploring the Contact Threshold:\nAvenues for Future Research\nOur proposed model introduces a variety of new ques-\ntions for intergroup researchers. To bridge the gap\nbetween the intergroup interaction and intergroup con-\ntact literatures, we need to explore the nature of the con-\ntact threshold. As a starting point, we introduce three\nspecific research questions for future examination, pro-\nviding potential, falsifiable answers to these questions.\nWhat factors influence when the\ncontact threshold is reached?\nNext, we identify potential factors that influence how\nmany intergroup interactions a person must have before\nmore intergroup interactions have positive, rather than\nnegative, individual, interpersonal, and societal inter-\ngroup bias outcomes, such as lower prejudice, lower\nintergroup interaction avoidance, and lower intergroup\nanxiety. We discuss each factor independently, but we\nrecognize that these factors probably covary and may\ninteract with one another to have an impact on the con-\ntact threshold.\nFactors expected to influence the Rate parameter of\nEquation 2.\nArtificial versus real-life setting. We speculate that the\ncontact threshold can be achieved through either labo-\nratory-based or real-world intergroup interactions. How-\never, given the quantity and quality of interactions that\nare likely required to give a person relatively high inter-\ngroup contact, the contact threshold is likely to be reached\nmore readily when interactions occur in real-world versus\nlaboratory settings. Although laboratory-based interactions\nafford empirical control, they also are more contrived, are\nmore unpredictable, and, as noted earlier, may be more\nanxiety-provoking. Real-world intergroup interactions have\nthe possibility of being chosen by each interaction partner,\nwhereas laboratory interaction partners are rarely chosen\nby the participant. In addition, it is resource-intensive to\nmanipulate multiple intergroup interactions in the labora-\ntory. However, it is more difficult to manipulate intergroup\ninteractions in the field, limiting causal inferences on the\nimpact of intergroup interaction versus any social interac-\ntion. Overall, therefore, a combination of both laboratory\nand real-world intergroup interactions may provide the\nmost accurate picture of intergroup interactions.\nFuture researchers should unpack the contact quantity\nquestion systematically to answer the question of the\namount of interactions required before a change on inter-\ngroup bias is observed (i.e., the point at which the contact\nthreshold is reached), considering moderating factors such\nas laboratory-based and real-world settings. We expect con-\ntact setting to impact the Rate parameter in Equation 2.\nSpecifically, we expect that fewer real-world versus labora-\ntory-based interactions would be required, but this remains\nan open question. Researchers may identify procedures\nwherein laboratory-based interactions can result in a rapid\nreaching of the contact threshold, which could be applied\nas a prejudice intervention strategy. For example, it may be\nnecessary to manipulate the quality of laboratory interac-\ntions (Page-Gould et al., 2008) for laboratory intergroup\ninteractions to affect intergroup bias.\nTime between interactions.Although it has not been\naddressed in the extant literature, we propose that, in\naddition to the amount of interactions, the time between\nthese interactions is an important factor contributing to\nwhen the contact threshold is reached. We speculate that\na shorter time interval between intergroup interactions\nresults in fewer intergroup interactions being needed to\nreach the contact threshold. If multiple intergroup inter-\nactions occur within a short time interval wherein the\ninitial interactions are still accessible in working mem-\nory, subsequent interactions may be more familiar and\npredictable and, hence, less stressful (see Mendes et al.,\n2007) than the same number of intergroup interactions\nthat were separated by greater expanses of time. Given\nfamiliarity and predictability, resources to effectively\ndeal with an intergroup interaction and to appraise it\nas nonstressful are likely to be built more quickly, and\nhence the contact threshold is likely to be reached more\nquickly. We suspect that even if there are days or weeks\nbetween intergroup interactions, the contact threshold\nwill be reachable, but the point at which the threshold\nis reached will depend on between-interactions time\nintervals. When the time between intergroup interac-\ntions moves beyond weeks and spans months or years,\nwe expect that intergroup interactions would remain\nrelatively unfamiliar and that each intergroup interaction\nwould be as stressful as the last. Extended time inter-\nvals between intergroup interactions likely render the\naccumulation of resources to effectively manage inter-\ngroup interactions more difficult. Indeed, those report-\ning rare intergroup interactions report more intergroup\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 317\nThus, it is possible that people who engage in intergroup\ninteractions only every few months or years may never\nreach the contact threshold, such that they continually\nhave anxiety-prone intergroup interactions that feed\navoidance of future intergroup interactions.\nWe anticipate that time between interactions will influ-\nence the Rate parameter of Equation 2. We hypothesize that\nthe relationship between inter-interaction interval and ben-\nefits that come from accumulated intergroup interactions\nwill be related to normal processes of memory decay. Using\nexperimental or daily diary methods, researchers could\nexamine the impact of time intervals between intergroup\ninteractions on intergroup bias. Shorter versus longer time\nintervals between intergroup interactions may result in a\nquicker reduction of intergroup bias, indicating a faster\nreaching of the contact threshold. Consistently, with espe-\ncially extended time intervals between intergroup interac-\ntions, intergroup bias may be unchanged, indicating a\nfailure to reach the contact threshold. It is also possible,\nhowever, that the contact threshold is robust to these time\nintervals and that the threshold will be reached by merely\nengaging in multiple intergroup interactions, regardless of\nthe interval between interactions.\nFactor expected to influence the x parameter of\nEquation 2: Number of interactions. It is almost a\ncertainty that multiple intergroup interactions are neces-\nsary to arrive at the contact threshold. For most people,\nthe first intergroup interaction will produce at least some\nintergroup anxiety, given that the first intergroup interac-\ntion represents an unfamiliar and potentially threatening\n2000). The degree to which a person's first intergroup\ninteraction is threatening probably highly depends on\nthe degree of stigma involved in the intergroup domain\n(Blascovich et al., 2001). We propose that the specific\nnumber range or proportion of intergroup interactions\n(i.e., out of all social interactions) required to reach the\ncontact threshold can be identified by conducting inter-\nmediate and long-term longitudinal work that has\nenough resolution to observe the number of intergroup\ninteractions that an individual has. In laboratory or field\ncontexts, the number of intergroup interactions that\nhave occurred before a change is observed in intergroup\nbias (e.g., intergroup anxiety, prejudice) will provide\ninsight into the number or proportion of intergroup\ninteractions required to reach the contact threshold.\nThere is likely a minimum number of intergroup interac-\ntions that a person must have before his or her history\nof intergroup interactions assumes the properties of\nintergroup contact.\nOne initial guess at the necessary number of intergroup\ninteractions before a change in intergroup behavior is\nobserved is three intergroup interactions. Page-Gould et al.\n(2008) found that implicitly biased participants exhibited\nphysiological stress to an initial intergroup interaction with\nan ethnic outgroup stranger, but they did not respond with\nphysiological stress to two subsequent intergroup interac-\ntions with the same person. Furthermore, after engaging in\nthese three intergroup interactions, participants who were\ninitially prejudiced initiated more intergroup interactions--\nresponses consistent with decreased intergroup bias. Of\ncourse, Page-Gould et al. (2008) examined intergroup inter-\nactions that were relatively long (i.e., each interaction was 1\nhr) and designed to promote interpersonal closeness\nthrough self-disclosure (Aron, Melinat, Aron, Vallone, &\nBator, 1997), thereby amplifying the normal development of\nfamiliarity. In addition, each intergroup interaction was\ninvariantly 1 week apart, so inferences cannot be made\nabout the impact of the timespan between interactions on\nthe contact threshold. The number or proportion of inter-\ngroup interactions necessary to reach the contact threshold\nwill likely depend on the duration and quality of the inter-\nactions, with more short, superficial interactions being\nrequired than long, intimate interactions. Regardless, initial\nresearch in which multiple intergroup interactions are\nexamined suggests that positive outcomes from intergroup\ninteractions may appear between the first and second inter-\ngroup interactions, assuming those interactions facilitate\ncloseness and are 1 week apart. These past findings likely\nreflect the earliest stage in the development of an ongoing\nrelationship with an outgroup member and, thus, may pro-\nvide a good starting point for examining the point at which\nthe contact threshold is reached. Future researchers examin-\ning the number of interactions should also vary whether\nmultiple interactions occur with the same outgroup mem-\nber or a series of outgroup strangers. The number of inter-\nactions is the x parameter of Equation 2.\nFactor expected to influence the slope of the asymp-\ntote: Intergroup domain. The contact threshold we\ndescribe refers to outgroups in general. We recognize,\nhowever, that the contact threshold may differ by inter-\ngroup domain (e.g., race, sexual orientation). It may even\nbe necessary to calculate a different contact threshold for\neach specific group domain (e.g., an interracial contact\nthreshold, an intersexual orientation threshold). We\nexpect that different intergroup domains would moderate\nthe slope of the asymptote itself (i.e., having an impact\non the Contact Effect parameter). Although our focus is\non a general contact threshold, we believe it would be\nfruitful for future researchers to examine specific group\ndomains separately as well.\nFactors expected to have multiple influences.\nForm of contact. Intergroup interactions can take many\nforms. Imagined contact (i.e., mentally simulating positive\ncontact with outgroup members; Crisp & Turner, 2012),\nextended contact (i.e., knowledge of ingroup members\nwho are friends with outgroup members; Wright, Aron,\nMcLaughlin-Volpe, & Ropp, 1997), and media contact\n(i.e., viewing or reading about positive intergroup con-\ntact in the media; Ortiz & Harwood, 2007) represent\nindirect forms of contact, with more substantial forms of\ncontact including direct, face-to-face intergroup interac-\ntions and online intergroup contact (MacInnis & Hodson,\n2014). We expect that the more psychologically investing\nthe form of contact, the faster the contact threshold will\nbe reached, with direct contact representing the fastest\nroute. Engaging in multiple forms of contact versus only\none form may also positively impact the rate at which\nthe threshold is reached. We anticipate that contact form\nwill have an impact on the asymptote itself or the Rate\nparameter in Equation 2, but these are empirical ques-\ntions. Future researchers can compare the influence of\nthese different forms of contact on the contact threshold.\nFamiliarity/experience.\nAs noted earlier, multiple\nintergroup interactions are required to reach the con-\ntact threshold whereby intergroup interactions assume\nthe properties of intergroup contact. These interactions,\nhowever, may take three possible forms: (a) multiple\ninteractions with the same outgroup member, (b) mul-\ntiple interactions with different members of the same\noutgroup, and (c) multiple interactions with different\nmembers of different outgroups. We predict that each of\nthese forms of intergroup interactions will result in the\ncontact threshold being reached but that multiple interac-\ntions with the same outgroup member will produce the\nlargest and most positive effect on intergroup bias, repre-\nsenting the fastest route to the threshold. Multiple inter-\nactions with the same outgroup member likely increase\nfamiliarity and experience such that the outgroup mem-\nber becomes more predictable and hence less threat-\nening (Mendes et al., 2007). Outgroup members likely\nbecome more familiar and predictable through Forms b\nand c of intergroup interaction as well, but we expect\nthat this process occurs more quickly through Form a.\nIndeed, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) found generalization\npatterns whereby interactions with single outgroup mem-\nbers are associated with less bias toward the outgroup\nas a whole (relevant to Form b), and interactions with\noutgroup members are associated with less bias toward\nother outgroups (relevant to Form c). These generaliza-\ntion or \"secondary transfer\" effects, however, are often\nlimited to similar or related outgroups (Pettigrew, 2009).\nFurther, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) found that the ame-\nliorative effects of intergroup contact on intergroup bias\nwere strongest for intergroup friendships, which involve\nrepeated interactions with the same outgroup member\n(relevant to Form a).\nCross-group friendships are widely recognized as\npowerful means by which to reduce intergroup bias\n(Davies et al., 2011). Outgroup friends may represent\npositive exemplars of outgroup members that modify ini-\ntial bias toward the outgroup. When an outgroup friend\nis made, one has an outgroup member whom they asso-\nciate with acceptance, positive affect, and positive atti-\ntudes (Mendoza-Denton, Page-Gould, & Pietrzak, 2006).\nThis new information is likely to replace previous nega-\ntive information about the outgroup (Wright et al., 1997).\nThus, multiple interactions with the same outgroup mem-\nber that result in a cross-group friendship may induce a\nchange whereby intergroup interactions are less strongly\nassociated with bias and stress. Indeed, having a cross-\nrace friend predicts less discomfort in everyday interra-\ncial interactions, such that comfort in cross-race\ninteractions was on par with comfort levels reported in\nsame-race interactions (Cook et al., 2012). The contact\nthreshold is likely to be reached sooner with this unique\nform of intergroup interaction relative to other forms.\nResearchers can examine the degree to which engag-\ning in interactions with the same outgroup member, mul-\ntiple members of the same outgroup, or multiple members\nof different outgroups has an impact on the point at\nwhich the contact threshold is reached. This may have an\nimpact on the intercept (Default Intergroup Bias) or Rate\nparameters of Equation 2, or it may have an impact on\nthe way that the x-axis is operationalized in both equa-\ntions. As we speculate, multiple interactions with the\nsame individual may represent the fastest route to the\ncontact threshold. Of course, multiple interactions with\ndifferent members of the same outgroup, or multiple\ninteractions with different members of different out-\ngroups, may allow the contact threshold to be reached\njust as quickly. Alternatively, it is possible that engaging\nin a combination of all three intergroup interaction forms\nrather than only one form allows the contact threshold to\nbe reached most quickly. Future laboratory experiments,\ndiary studies, and field studies are necessary to examine\nthese possibilities.\nIndividual differences.Individual differences, which\ncan strongly influence both intergroup bias and inter-\ngroup contact (Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002; Hodson,\nCostello, & MacInnis, 2013), are also likely to influence\nthe point at which the contact threshold is reached. We\nexpect these individual differences to have an impact on\nnot only the Rate parameter of Equation 2 but also the\nintercept (Default Intergroup Bias).\nTwo individual differences that have been identified as\nstrong predictors of intergroup bias and moderators of the\nrelationship between intergroup contact and intergroup\nbias are likely to be especially influential: right-wing\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 319\nauthoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation\n(SDO; Hodson et al., 2013). RWA is characterized by con-\nventionalism, submission to authority, and aggression\ntoward norm violators (Altemeyer, 1996), whereas SDO is\ncharacterized by the support of group hierarchies and\ngroup inequality (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle,\n1994). Although the motivational goals underlying preju-\ndice differ for those relatively high in RWA or SDO\n(Duckitt, 2005), in general, individuals relatively high in\nRWA or SDO tend to avoid interacting with outgroup\nmembers, preferring instead to interact with similar others\n(Hodson et al., 2013). However, when contact with out-\ngroup members is unavoidable, it is associated with sig-\nnificantly lower intergroup bias for those high in RWA\n(Dhont & Van Hiel, 2009; Hodson, Harry, & Mitchell,\nHodson, 2008; but for an exception, see Asbrock, Christ,\nDuckitt, & Sibley, 2012). In fact, it has been suggested that\nintergroup contact best reduces prejudice among those\nhigh in RWA or SDO (Hodson et al., 2013). That is, inter-\ngroup contact is most beneficial to those who have the\nmost to gain: those who are prone to prejudice.\nThese findings suggest, on the one hand, that it may\ntake longer for the contact threshold to be reached\namong people high in RWA or SDO, given that these\nindividuals avoid interacting with outgroup members. If\nthere are no intergroup interactions or only very rare\nintergroup interactions, it is unlikely that the contact\nthreshold will be reached. On the other hand, however,\ngiven that contact is strongly associated with less inter-\ngroup bias among those high in RWA or SDO (Hodson et\nal., 2013), only a small amount of interactions may be\nrequired to reach the contact threshold for these indi-\nviduals. A third possibility is that the contact threshold\ncan never truly be reached among those high in RWA or\nSDO. Whereas intergroup bias is reduced more so for\nthese individuals relative to the reduction in bias observed\nfor people low in RWA or SDO or people high in RWA or\nSDO who do not engage in contact, intergroup contact\nmay not be associated with low intergroup bias for those\nhigh in RWA or SDO in an absolute sense. That is,\nrepeated interactions may result in a relative reduction in\nintergroup bias, but a complete lack of bias or positivity\ntoward the outgroup (i.e., the contact threshold) may\nnever be achieved, given the inherent susceptibility of\nthese individuals to intergroup bias.\nIt is imperative that these possibilities be reconciled to\nunderstand the impact of these individual differences on\nthe point at which the contact threshold whereby inter-\ngroup interactions assume the properties of intergroup\ncontact is reached. This research will be especially diffi-\ncult in naturalistic settings, given the tendency of people\nhigh in RWA or SDO to avoid outgroup members (Hodson\net al., 2013). However, experimental studies, or studies of\nenvironments in which intergroup interaction is unavoid-\nable, will be informative. Researchers can investigate the\namount of intergroup interactions required among those\nhigh in RWA or SDO before a qualitative reduction in\nintergroup bias is observed. Future researchers can also\nexamine other individual differences related to bias or\nintergroup contact that may have an impact on the point\nwherein the contact threshold is reached, such as open-\nness to experience (Hodson, Hogg, & MacInnis, 2009),\nconservatism (Van Hiel, Pandelaere, & Duriez, 2004), or\nneed for self-expansion (Wright et al., 2002).\nWhat observations can be used to\nidentify when the contact threshold\nhas been reached?\nIn addition to determining factors influencing the point at\nwhich the contact threshold is reached, it is important to\nuncover observable means by which to identify exactly\nwhen the threshold has been reached.\nQuantitative observations. Quantitatively, the contact\nthreshold has been reached when reductions in inter-\ngroup bias as a function of intergroup contact are not\nsignificantly different from a standardized slope of -.21.\nA t value can be hand-calculated from the results of a\nregression equation. Assuming the appropriate data have\nbeen collected, intergroup bias can be regressed on the\nnumber of intergroup interactions, and the unstandard-\nized slope of intergroup interactions and its standard\nerror should be saved. Normally, the unstandardized\nslope is divided by its standard error to obtain a t statistic\nthat can be used to test whether the slope is significantly\ndifferent from zero. Thus, to determine whether the slope\nis significantly different from -.21, this value should be\nsubtracted from the unstandardized slope, and this differ-\nence would be divided by the standard error to obtain a\nt value for this test. The probability of observing this t\nvalue can be obtained with the same degrees of freedom\nthat were used to estimate this slope in the original\nregression, although this approach would only be legiti-\nmate in sample sizes large enough to detect a very small\neffect (J. Cohen, 1992). Bayesian linear modeling can\nalso be used to estimate the slope given an observed set\nof data, and this approach would be preferable in small\nto moderate sized samples. In this case, the researcher\nwould conclude that the contact threshold had been\nreached if the 95% highest posterior density interval\nderived from Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simula-\ntions of the slope did not include -.21.\nQualitative observations.Reaching the contact thresh-\nold likely involves a number of qualitative changes in a per-\nson, whereby intergroup interactions no longer produce\nintergroup bias and may even promote positivity toward\nthe outgroup. There are likely identifiable means to pin-\npoint when this shift has occurred or is imminent. Next,\nwe discuss two possible means to determine that the\ncontact threshold has been reached.\nInitiating contact.One behavioral \"marker\" demon-\nstrating that the contact threshold has been reached is\nthe initiation of intergroup interactions. Individuals high\nin intergroup anxiety and intergroup bias generally are\nunlikely to initiate contact with outgroup members (J. W.\nonce intergroup bias begins to decrease with succes-\nsive intergroup interactions, a person is likely to become\nmore comfortable initiating intergroup interactions. Self-\nexpansion theory purports that people are motivated to\n\"expand\" the self to include resources, identities, and\nperspectives that will enhance their self-efficacy and per-\nsonal value (Aron, Norman, & Aron, 1998). This theory\nhas been extended to the intergroup domain, such that\ndeveloping closeness with outgroup members and includ-\ning outgroup members in the self can represent a means\nof self-expansion (Wright et al., 2002). One likely has to\nreach a point in which connecting with outgroup mem-\nbers represents a worthwhile means of self-expansion,\nhowever. The contact threshold may be this point. That\nis, once bias begins to dissipate following multiple inter-\ngroup interactions, one may seek out interactions with\noutgroup members as a means of self-expansion. Future\nresearchers may investigate this possibility by measuring\nwho initiates daily social interactions.\nViewing outgroup members as friends or potential\nfriends.\nAnother possible indicator that the contact\nthreshold is reached is that outgroup members become\nviewed as friends or potential friends. Pettigrew (1998)\nsuggested the opportunity for friendship as an essen-\ntial condition for intergroup contact. When outgroup\nmembers are viewed as potential friends, subsequent\nintergroup interactions are more likely, providing more\nopportunity to reduce intergroup bias and to maintain\npositive intergroup attitudes (Pettigrew, 1998). Feelings of\nfriendship or closeness with outgroup members have also\nbeen described as the means by which contact reduces\nintergroup bias (Wright et al., 2005). At least some initial\nintergroup interactions would likely be required before\noutgroup members are viewed as potential friends,\nand indeed we have argued in this article that repeated\nfriendly interactions with the same outgroup member\nwould produce a relatively faster reaching of the contact\nthreshold. Further, it may be that a defining characteristic\nof the contact threshold is viewing outgroup members\nas potential friends. Once this occurs, future intergroup\ninteractions are unlikely to be plagued by intergroup bias\nbut instead to be approached with positivity (i.e., the\ncontact threshold is reached). Future researchers could\ntest this speculation by asking about friendship potential\nwhen measuring intergroup interactions or contact.\nDo the effects of reaching the contact\nthreshold disappear if intergroup\ncontact is ceased?\nOne interesting question for future research concerns\nwhether the effects of reaching the contact threshold are\npermanent. If intergroup contact decreases significantly\nor ceases completely (e.g., if a person moves from a\ndiverse to nondiverse area), the effects of the contact\nthreshold may be lost over time. That is, ongoing inter-\ngroup interactions may be required to maintain the con-\ntact threshold. Without regular intergroup interactions, a\nperson may return to his or her original, prethreshold\nlevels of intergroup bias--or the effects of the contact\nthreshold may be permanent. Three possible answers to\nthis question are discussed next.\nThe effects of the contact threshold would disap-\npear completely. It is possible that if intergroup contact\nis ceased, the effects of the contact threshold would dis-\nappear. That is, a person may reach the contact threshold\nby partaking in multiple intergroup interactions but even-\ntually return to initial levels of intergroup bias if inter-\ngroup interactions stopped altogether. If this person then\nresumed intergroup interactions after a period of no\nintergroup interactions, just as many interactions as were\noriginally required to reach the contact threshold may be\nneeded again. The ideal means to test this possibility\nwould be longitudinal work in which researchers follow\npeople over many years or cross-sectional work in which\nresearchers examine people who have recently moved\nbetween geographical areas that differ in diversity. If the\nintergroup bias of those who significantly reduce or\ncease intergroup contact completely returns to baseline\nlevels, this possibility would be supported.\nThe effects of the contact threshold would not com-\npletely disappear and would be recovered quickly.\nAnother possibility is that once the contact threshold is\nreached, an individual will never return to his or her orig-\ninal level of intergroup bias, even if he or she ceases\nintergroup contact completely. The effects of the contact\nthreshold may remain intact or decay only somewhat,\ngiven that one would likely retain a behavioral script for\nintergroup interactions (Abelson, 1981; Husnu & Crisp,\nProcedural memory is relatively robust to decay (M. D.\nCohen & Bacdayan, 1994). Thus, even after ceasing\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 321\nintergroup contact, one would maintain the resources to\nevaluate intergroup interactions as predictable and non-\nstressful and continue to view outgroup members as\npotential friends. In this way, once the contact threshold\nis reached, intergroup interaction may be something like\nriding a bicycle--one never forgets how to do so effec-\ntively. This could be investigated through longitudinal\nwork. If the intergroup bias of those having previously\nreached the contact threshold is unchanged or changed\nonly slightly when intergroup contact is significantly\nreduced or ceased, then this possibility would be sup-\nported. Further, in the event that the effects of the contact\nthreshold decay somewhat, they may be recovered\nquickly similar to \"savings\" effects of memory (Nelson,\n1978). That is, when intergroup contact ceases, a person\nwho had previously reached the contact threshold may\nreach it more quickly when resuming intergroup interac-\ntions than a person who has never reached the threshold.\nThis could also be examined in longitudinal work.\nIt depends. The degree to which the effects of the con-\ntact threshold endure when intergroup contact is ceased\nmay depend on several factors. First, this could depend\non individual differences. Those individuals particularly\nprone to intergroup bias (e.g., those high in RWA or SDO;\nDuckitt, 2005) may be more susceptible to returning to\ntheir original levels of intergroup bias when intergroup\ncontact ceases than those who are not especially prone\nto bias. These bias-prone individuals may revert back to\noriginal intergroup bias levels after only a short period\nwithout intergroup contact. Another individual difference\nthat may be relevant is motivation to respond without\nprejudice (Plant & Devine, 1998). Individuals high on this\nconstruct actively strive to appear nonprejudiced for\ninternal or external reasons. Such individuals may be\nespecially motivated, when reaching the contact thresh-\nold, to actively maintain the positive effects obtained.\nThus, those higher on motivation to control prejudice\nmay be more likely to retain the positive effects of the\ncontact threshold even in the absence of intergroup con-\ntact. By contrast, the construct of motivation to respond\nwith prejudice has begun to be recently explored\n(Forscher & Devine, under review). For individuals who\nare highly motivated to be prejudiced toward an out-\ngroup for either normative or personal reasons, the con-\ntact threshold may be particularly permeable.\nThe degree to which the effects of the contact thresh-\nold endure following a stoppage of intergroup contact\nmay also depend on whether an individual engages in\nalternative forms of contact. Although environments\ncompletely devoid of any type of intergroup interactions\nare likely rare, engaging in some alternative form of con-\ntact may serve to maintain the positive effects of the con-\ntact threshold for people with a complete lack of\nintergroup interaction. Imagined contact (Crisp & Turner,\ncontact (Ortiz & Harwood, 2007) may prove effective in\nreducing intergroup bias when there are no opportuni-\nties for direct intergroup contact. An individual who\nengages in one or more of these alternative forms of\ncontact may be more likely to maintain the positive\neffects of the contact threshold. Again, longitudinal work\nin which researchers follow those who have reached the\ncontact threshold will be necessary to investigate these\npossibilities.\nLimitations\nThere are a number of limitations existing across the\nintergroup interaction and intergroup contact literatures\nthat warrant examination. First, although wide varieties\nof social groups have been examined, the largest propor-\ntion of work across the literatures has focused on racial\nor ethnic groups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Toosi et al.,\n2012). The field would benefit from more balanced cov-\nerage of social groups to further expand the understand-\ning of intergroup interactions in general. Second,\nresearchers of both intergroup interaction and intergroup\ncontact studies primarily use majority group members as\nparticipants. Although this is likely a more practical\napproach, it is incomplete given that the association\nbetween intergroup contact and intergroup bias is sub-\nstantially weaker among minority group members (Tropp\n& Pettigrew, 2005). Our model is limited by the research\nin which it is grounded. Additional research is necessary\nto examine intergroup interactions from the perspective\nof minority group members.\nAlthough we point out discrepancies between the\nintergroup interaction and intergroup contact literatures,\nit would be inaccurately simplistic to infer that one litera-\nture is \"right\" and one literature is \"wrong.\" Indeed, both\nliteratures have produced valuable and informative\nresults, with each perspective providing its own unique\ncontributions to the understanding of intergroup pro-\ncesses. A greater proportion of intergroup interaction\nstudies, for example, have been experimental and have\nprovided a degree of control and causal inference that is\nimpossible in cross-sectional studies. Researchers of a\ngreater proportion of intergroup contact studies, how-\never, have assessed contact in everyday, natural settings\nthat provide ecological validity that is impossible to\nobtain in laboratory studies. Each literature provides\nfindings that we consider true, but these findings are spe-\ncific to the given context in which they are situated. That\nis, the findings of the intergroup interaction literature are,\nfor the most part, specific to first-time, short interactions\nwith an unknown outgroup member. In the same vein,\nthe findings of the intergroup contact literature are, for\nthe most part, specific to longer term, more frequent, and\nfamiliar intergroup interactions. As a result, it may be\nineffective to extrapolate the findings from intergroup\ninteraction studies to intergroup contact contexts and\nvice versa. For example, it cannot be assumed, on the\nbasis of the intergroup interaction literature, that a per-\nson's interaction with his or her long-term, cross-group\nfriend will produce greater anxiety than interactions with\na same-group stranger. Likewise, it cannot be assumed,\non the basis of the intergroup contact literature, that a\nperson's first interaction with an outgroup member is\ngoing to immediately result in less prejudice toward that\noutgroup. In the absence of recognizing the divide\nbetween the intergroup interaction and intergroup con-\ntact literatures, such inferential errors are common.\nIs Reaching the Threshold Enough?\nWhen reaching the contact threshold, intergroup interac-\ntions are associated with lower intergroup bias, consistent\nwith the intergroup contact literature (Pettigrew & Tropp,\n2006). With intergroup contact considered by some as \"our\nbest hope\" for improving intergroup relations (Wright et al.,\nsidered an ideal outcome. However, assuming an overall\ngoal of intergroup harmony, is reaching the threshold\nenough? Intergroup contact is not exclusively associated\nwith positive outcomes. As noted earlier, the association\nbetween intergroup contact and intergroup bias is weaker\nfor minority group members. Further, given its tendency to\nblur group differences, intergroup contact can reduce the\nlikelihood that disadvantaged group members will engage\nin collective action, which is a critical strategy for achieving\nsocial change (Saguy, Tausch, Dovidio, & Pratto, 2009;\nWright & Lubensky, 2008). Thus, reaching the contact\nthreshold may have a small positive impact on bias but\nnonetheless maintain group inequality.\nFor intergroup contact to not undermine collective\naction, an explicit recognition of intergroup inequality as\nillegitimate during intergroup interaction appears to be key\n(Becker, Wright, Lubensky, & Zhou, 2013). We speculate\nthat this is most likely to occur naturally in cross-group\nfriendships, which involve a strong interpersonal connec-\ntion, sense of shared reality, and inclusion of other in the\nself (Davies, Wright, Aron, & Comeau, 2013; Page-Gould,\nMendoza-Denton, Alegre, & Siy, 2010; Turner, Hewstone,\nVoci, & Vonofakou, 2008). Although reaching the contact\nthreshold is not a panacea for intergroup relations, it may\nrepresent a starting point to more harmonious intergroup\nrelations by promoting cross-group friendships and encour-\naging subsequent intergroup contact. Reaching the contact\nthreshold may be associated with heightened openness to\nmaking cross-group friends. We suggest viewing outgroup\nmembers as potential friends as a possible defining feature\nof the contact threshold. If, when reaching the threshold,\none indeed develops a cross-group friendship or friend-\nships, this is likely to be much more beneficial to intergroup\nrelations as a whole than reaching the threshold alone.\nConclusion\nDecades of research have demonstrated that intergroup\ninteractions have a negative impact on intergroup bias in\nthe short term but a positive impact in the long term.\nAlthough this apparent paradox has been recognized else-\nunique and timely contribution to the scientific study of\nintergroup relations, presenting means by which the dis-\ncrepant findings from the intergroup interaction and inter-\ngroup contact literatures can be resolved and reconciled.\nEssentially, researchers of intergroup interaction and inter-\ngroup contact studies examine the same constructs but on\ndifferent scales. Whereas researchers of intergroup interac-\ntion studies typically assess one intergroup interaction,\nresearchers of intergroup contact studies typically assess a\nperson's history of intergroup interactions. Given these dif-\nferent levels of analysis, the methodological approaches of\nthe two literatures have varied substantially, likely account-\ning for their discrepant results. Overall, we demonstrate that\ntwo literatures that seem to produce very different outcomes\nmay simply tell different parts of the same story.\nTo clarify the complex association between inter-\ngroup interactions and intergroup bias then, we pro-\npose a mathematical model that will reconcile the\ndifferences between the two literatures and generate\ninnovative new research avenues. Specifically, we\ndescribe the relationship between intergroup interac-\ntions and intergroup bias as an oblique asymptote, and\nwe use this model to identify the point at which the\ncurvilinear function produced by natural data aligns\nwith the linear relationship identified through meta-\nanalysis (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). We refer to this\npoint as the contact threshold, whereby intergroup\ninteractions assume the positive bias-reducing proper-\nties of intergroup contact. We propose that thinking\nabout the connection between intergroup interactions\nand intergroup contact in terms of the contact threshold\nis a useful means to integrate the seemingly paradoxical\nfindings of the intergroup interaction and intergroup\ncontact literatures. We hope that researchers will use\nand amend this framework to deepen people's under-\nstanding of the way that social interactions affect the\nhealth of intergroup relations in this diverse world.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared that they had no conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the authorship or the publication of this article.\nReconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 323\n"
