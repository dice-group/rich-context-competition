Just like neighborhoods, schools differ in terms of their level\nof structural characteristics such as the concentration of immigrant children and children from disrupted families. Such\ncharacteristics may also shape delinquency. The present study aims to test the relationship between structural characteristics\nof schools and child antisocial behavior, using a sample of elementary school children (N = 779, aged 10-12 years in the urban\ncontext of Ghent, Belgium). This study found that the concentration of children from disrupted families has an independent\neffect on child delinquency, independent of social bonds, moral cognitions, and moral emotions. The contextual effect is fully\nmediated by exposure to peer delinquency.\n",

Out of all ecological setting characteristics, the nega-\ntive effects of neighborhood disadvantage (the concentration\nof poor people in areas of residence) have been studied most\nintensively (Oberwittler, Rabold, & Baier, 2013; Sampson,\n2012). Very often, the \"contextual effects\" literature is con-\nducted from the social disorganization perspective. This per-\nspective highlights the negative effects of the spatial\nconcentration of disadvantage, such as concentrated disad-\nvantage, immigrant concentration, residential mobility, and\nfamily disruption. In the present study, we translate key ideas\ndeveloped in the rich social disorganization tradition to the\nschool context. Shaw and McKay (1942) were among the\nfirst to empirically demonstrate that neighborhood structural\ncharacteristics were correlated with delinquency rates. It was\nargued that neighborhood social disorganization weakens the\nability of local social institutions to control residents' behav-\nior and results in the breakdown of informal control in the\ncommunity. These ideas have been further developed by\nSampson and Groves (1989), Grasmick, Tittle, Bursik, and\nArneklev (1993), and Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls\n(1997). Especially, collective efficacy theory spawned a rich\nbody of empirical research (Sampson, 2012). One of the key\nlocal institutions that is affected by structural disadvantage is\nthe (elementary) school in the local community. Reiss (1995)\nnoted, \"Schools are rarely a microcosm of the communities\nin which they are located\" (p. 307). Given that structural\ncharacteristics of schools are affected by both local and\nextra-local factors (such as policy decisions taken at the\nregional and national level), it is reasonable to assume that\nthe same mechanisms that apply to neighborhoods as eco-\nlogical units also apply to schools as ecological units. Schools\nmay indeed have an impact on youth behavior that is inde-\npendent of neighborhood and family influences. From a his-\ntorical point of view, school contextual effects have been less\nstudied than neighborhood effects (Sellstr\u00f6m & Bremberg,\nscholars often--implicitly or explicitly--neglected school\ncontextual effects because they sometimes assume that\nschools vary predominantly as a function of the demographic\nand social organizational characteristics of neighborhoods,\n1Ghent University, Belgium\n2Malm\u00f6 University, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nLieven J.

Thus, to fully comprehend the\netiology of antisocial behavior, scholars should not ignore\nschool contextual effects. Just like neighborhoods, schools\nare an important agent of socialization, which may be of rel-\nevance for the unfolding of antisocial behavior (DiPietro,\nSlocum, & Esbensen, 2014; Herrenkohl, Hawkins, Chung,\nHill, & Battin-Pearson, 2000). Pupils pass substantial hours\nper day in schools. Thus, the amount of time that pupils are\nexposed to different features in the school setting may leave\na mark on the adolescent who takes part in a school context.\nContemporary European research on adolescent offending\nsuggests that unique contextual effects of school-level char-\nacteristics on offending exceed neighborhood contextual\nPauwels, Weerman, Bruinsma, & Bernasco, 2014).\nStructural Determinants of School-\nLevel Disorganization and Delinquency\nThere exists an ongoing debate about the negative conse-\nquences of concentrations in schools of economically disad-\nvantaged adolescents together with collective and subcultural\nvalues with regard to offending (Bernburg & Thorlindsson,\n& Mcnulty, 1994). Building on previous work of Bradshaw,\nPauwels (2013), we apply social disorganization theory to\nthe school context and search for (a) independent contextual\neffects of structural determinants of school-level social dis-\norganization such as immigrant concentration and family\ndisruption at the school level on offending and (b) mediators\nof school contextual effects such as informal controls, moral\nbeliefs, moral emotions, and exposure to peer delinquency.\nSocial disorganization theory has long been recognized as\na fruitful theoretical background to study the effects of segre-\ngation in neighborhoods and schools (D. Gottfredson, 2001).\nSocial disorganization theory deals basically with the nega-\ntive consequences of segregation and the weakening of tradi-\ntional institutions of socialization (Bruinsma, Pauwels,\nWeerman, & Bernasco, 2013). The theory has pointed to fam-\nily disruption as one of the major structural characteristics that\nhas implications for informal control (Sampson & Groves,\n1989). Applying social disorganization theory to schools, we\nhypothesize that structural characteristics of schools impede\nthe maintaining of informal controls (such as attachment and\ncommitment to parents and schools), which in turn may\nimpede the development of prosocial moral beliefs and moral\nemotions, and stimulate unstructured routine activities and\nexposure to peer delinquency (Laub & Sampson, 2003;\nOsgood, Wilson, O'Malley, Bachman, & Johnston, 1996).\nHowever, much of the evidence is based on samples of youths\nin early- to midadolescence (Vynckier & Pauwels, 2010). It is\nless common that school effects of disadvantage on antisocial\nbehavior are tested on samples of elementary school children.\nUsing hierarchical multilevel models, we evaluate the inde-\npendent effects of two key structural characteristics of\nschools that originate from social disorganization theory.\nThe focus of this study lies on school-level family disruption\n(i.e., the percentage of children from a one-parent family)\nand school-level immigrant concentration (the percentage of\nchildren who have an immigrant background).1\nThe contextual effects literature points to distinct individ-\nual-level mediators of the relationship between structural\ncharacteristics of schools and delinquency: Control theorists\nhave stressed the importance of informal controls such as\nsocial bonds and prosocial beliefs, while social learning the-\nories (R. Akers, 2006) and the routine activities theory of\ngeneral deviance (Osgood et al., 1996) have stressed the\nimportance of exposure to peer delinquency and unstruc-\ntured socializing. There exists a tremendous body of evi-\ndence of the inhibiting effects of pupils'attachment to school\nand positive relationships with teachers on adolescent delin-\nKillias, & Junger-Tas, 2012) and deviant beliefs and delin-\nquency (R. Akers, 2006). The relationship between peer\ndelinquency, unstructured socializing, and juvenile delin-\nquency has been established in numerous studies. Spending\ntime with peers in an unstructured setting and in the absence\nof adult supervision may seduce adolescents to take opportu-\nnities to break rules for symbolic rewards like status and repu-\nare assumed to influence juvenile delinquency by providing\ndefinitions and attitudes which are favorable to the violation\nof laws, and by reinforcing delinquent behavior through\nWeerman, 2004). In addition, these aforementioned charac-\nteristics have been identified as mediators of school charac-\nteristics in previous multilevel studies (L. Pauwels, 2013).\nThis means that they were able to account for school contex-\ntual effects on antisocial behavior. While many studies have\nestablished a relationship between moral beliefs (either pro-\nsocial or antisocial moral beliefs) and antisocial behavior (for\na discussion, see Svensson, Pauwels, & Weerman, 2011),\nonly a few studies have focused on moral emotions such as\nshame and guilt (Blackwell, 2000; Hosser, Windzio, & Grev,\n& Tibbetts, 2010; Svensson, Weerman, Pauwels, Bruinsma,\nTreiber, & Hardie, 2012).2 However, none of the above-men-\ntioned studies investigated to what extent the moral emotions\nof anticipated guilt and shame can account for school-level\ndifferences in child antisocial behavior. To summarize, the\nunique goal of the present study to the empirical literature is\n(a) to evaluate contextual effects of school characteristics\nfrom social disorganization theory on child antisocial behav-\nior and (b) to evaluate the unique contribution of potential\nmediators from different theoretical traditions, that is, social\nbonds, prosocial moral beliefs and moral emotions, and expo-\nsure to peer delinquency.\nPauwels and Svensson 3\nContext or Composition?\nThe study of school contextual stems comes originally from\neducational research. Much attention in educational research\nhas been given to understanding how internal school ties\ninfluence school effectiveness. Theory and research in this\narea are often categorized under the rubric of communal\nschool organization, that is, the social organization of schools\nas a community with a set of traditions, values, and a shared\nexistence (Bryk & Driscoll, 1988; Bryk, Lee, & Holland,\n1993; G. D. Gottfredson, Gottfredson, Payne, & Gottfredson,\nand organizational characteristics of a school, as well as its\nsocial climate, consistently correlate with unsatisfactory\nexam results (Goldstein & Sammons, 1997), school failure\nwell-being (De Fraine, Van Landeghem, & Van Damme,\n2005). Many scholars have investigated the role of the school\ncontext in the explanation of juvenile delinquency (Demanet\n2013). The literature reviews by Sellstr\u00f6m and Bremberg\neffects of structural characteristics of schools (such as disad-\nvantage) on delinquency vary between countries, from small-\nOusey and Wilcox (2005) found that all of the differences\nbetween schools are due to their differential composition.\nHowever, some scholars have found substantial contextual\neffects. Lindstr\u00f6m (1995) found small but substantial con-\ntextual effects on juvenile delinquency, but only for boys.\neffects of the school social climate (values) which were inde-\npendent of individual-level conventional beliefs of adoles-\ncents. A study by Sapouna (2010) showed that school-level\ncollective efficacy is significantly related to school bullying.\nSome Belgian studies found that school-level disadvantage\nwas related to violent youth group involvement (L. Pauwels,\n2008) and juvenile delinquency in early adolescence (L.\nMany explanations have been given for the observed dif-\nferences between findings: Studies differ in terms of the\npopulation of interest (adolescents, children), units of analy-\nsis (the classroom vs. school effect), sampling design and\nsampling error, the measurement of concepts, measurement\nerror, and model specifications. Despite the differences\nbetween studies, it seems fair to conclude that--if school\ncontextual effects are found on measures of antisocial behav-\nior--they are usually small and the magnitude of the effect is\ndepending on the measure of offending: Intra class correla-\ntions seem to be somewhat larger for serious offending ver-\nsus more common offending (L. Pauwels, Hardyns, & Van\nSocial Bonds, Moral Beliefs and\nEmotions, and Peer Exposure as\nMediators of School Effects\nThe conceptual theory-driven model outlined in Figure 1 is\nbased on insights from integrated theories (e.g., Laub &\ntextual effects are rather indirect and should be mediated\nthrough a series of individual-level mechanisms. Social\nbonds, moral beliefs, and moral emotions are key mediators\nthat are stressed in control theories. The development of\nmoral beliefs and moral emotions of shame and guilt emerge\nduring the process of primary socialization, and the family is\nessential for the development of these emotions (e.g., Abell\nthrough school and the peer group may consolidate or adjust\nthe socialization process is completed, norms are internal-\nized and the individual develops a moral sense of what is\nSchool-level family disrupon\nSchool-level immigrant\nconcentraon\nParental control\nParental\naachment\nSchool social\nbond\nSex\nImmigrant\nbackground\nFamily structure\nChild ansocial\nbehavior\nSchool differences\nin child ansocial\nbehavior\nExposure to peer\ndelinquency\nProsocial moral\nbeliefs\nShame\nGuilt\nFigure 1.

This leads the individual to\nfeel ashamed in relation to significant others and experience\nthe painful feeling of guilt when the individual breaks a\nmoral rule (e.g., by committing an offense; see Svensson,\nIn short, in today's influential integrative theories of\noffending, such as Laub and Sampson's (2003) age-graded\ntheory of informal control and Wikstr\u00f6m's (2010) situational\naction theory, social bonds are seen as important mechanisms\nwith implications for the youth's moral beliefs and emotions,\nwhich in turn have implications for unstructured routines,\nexposure to peer delinquency, and offending. In situational\naction theory, moral beliefs together with moral emotions,\nsuch as shame and guilt, are seen as a \"moral filter\" through\nwhich seeing crime as an alternative is affected. In short,\nsituational action theory argues that juvenile delinquency is\nany action that is guided by (moral) rules about what it is\nright or wrong to do, or not to do, in particular circumstances.\nActs of crime are actions that breach moral rules defined in\nlaw (Wikstr\u00f6m, 2010). To explain acts of crime is essentially\nto explain moral action. Whether crime is perceived as an\naction alternative depends on the individual's perception of\nwhat it is right and wrong to do. Moral evaluations of crimi-\nnal behavior and associated emotions such as anticipated\nshame and guilt are three important dimensions that make up\none's overall morality in this theoretical framework.\nAlthough attitudes that are supportive of lawbreaking are\nstable covariates of offending that mediate the relationship\nbetween social bonds and offending (Svensson et al., 2013),\nless is known empirically from criminological inquiries\nabout the mediating role of moral feelings.\nShame emerges when an individual commits an act that\nviolates internalized norms, and feels that he or she fails to\nlive up to the norms of the group (Elster, 1999; Svensson,\n2004). The individual feels ashamed in front of other people.\nIt has been pointed out that \"we often do everything we can\nto avoid the feeling of shame . . . the anticipation of shame\nacts as a powerful regulator of behaviour\" (Elster, 1999,\np. 154). Guilt, on the contrary, emerges when an individual\ncommits a specific act that violates prevailing norms and val-\nues and then judges the violation of the norm as a morally\nwrong act (Elster, 1999). Guilt is considered as less painful\nthan shame as the emotion of guilt is related to a specific act\nwhile shame relates to the individual's perception of the self\nthrough the eyes of others and of these others' disapproval\nFinally, exposure to peer delinquency is considered as a\nmediating mechanism. Exposure to peers can be interpreted\nfrom different angles: From a social learning perspective, peers\n2011), but from a routine-activities/lifestyle perspective, crime\nprone individuals selectively are drawn toward delinquent peers,\nwho in turn act as situational instigators. Although we acknowl-\nedge the complexity of the peer delinquency and offending\nrelationship, we consider exposure to peer delinquency to be\nboth a consequence of selection effects and consider the effect\nof peers on delinquency at the same time as a situational trig-\nger (see Wikstr\u00f6m & Butterworth, 2006; Wikstr\u00f6m et al.,\nHypotheses\nTo analyze whether school-level family disruption and immi-\ngrant concentration are relevant factors that explain child\ndelinquency, a series of blockwise multilevel negative bino-\nmial regression models are run. Several hypotheses are tested\nas follows:\nHypothesis 1: There are substantial differences between\nschools in child antisocial behavior independent of the\ncomposition of the school.\nHypothesis 2: Family disruption and immigrant concen-\ntration are positively related to child antisocial behavior\nindependent of the school composition.\nHypothesis 3: Informal controls are inversely related to\nchild antisocial behavior and partially account for school\ncontextual effects.\nHypothesis 4: Moral beliefs and moral emotions are\ninversely related to child antisocial behavior and mediate\nthe effects of informal controls and school-level\nvariables.\nHypothesis 5: Exposure to peer delinquency is positively\nrelated to child antisocial behavior and further mediates\nthe effects of school-level variables and individual-level\nmechanisms.\nData\nThe data used in the present study come from a self-reported\ndelinquency study conducted in the urban context of Ghent,\nBelgium. Ghent is one of the Belgian cities that has more\nthan 100,000 inhabitants. It is a city located in the Flemish\nregion of Belgium. It is the capital and largest city of the East\nFlanders province. Currently, Ghent comprises of nearly\n300,000 inhabitants. There is a huge disparity between Ghent\nneighborhoods with regard to its crime rate.\nThe sample consists of elementary school children, that\nis, children who are in the primary compulsory education in\nthe Belgian educational system. The focus is restricted to\nchildren in the two highest grades of primary compulsory\neducation. These children are typically between 10 and 12\nyears old. The two highest grades were chosen from a devel-\nopmental criminological perspective, that is, these pupils are\nevolving from being children to adolescents (Eisenberg,\nDamon, & Lerner, 2006). Many studies have shown that\nchildhood antisocial behavior predicts offending during later\nstages of human development. From a methodological point\nof view, selective nonresponse has been shown to be lower\nPauwels and Svensson 5\namong children in primary education compared with adoles-\ncents in secondary education (Rovers, 1997).\nThe obtained sample is a convenience sample, with a lot\nof variation in school context, educational level, and ethnic\nbackground. It was not possible to draw a random sample\nrepresenting the youth population in the area exactly. In the\nbeginning of 2012, a letter was written to all school princi-\npals of primary education schools located in Ghent. In this\nletter, the goals of the study were explained and participation\nwas requested. The main reason to refuse participation was\nthat schools already participated in other studies and/or\nreceived too many requests from agencies. A questionnaire\nfor self-administration was handed out to the schoolchildren\nin separate classrooms; most of the surveys were conducted\nby staff, and some questionnaires were administrated with\nthe help of the schools. Passive informed consent was\nobtained from the parents. Schools in the inner-city districts\nof Ghent (postal code area: 9000) were somewhat oversam-\npled as these schools tend to have higher concentrations of\npoor children and children from ethnic minorities, but suffi-\ncient schools in the surrounding districts that are administra-\ntively part of Ghent were reached.\nIn all, 884 children turned in a questionnaire and after\ncareful data cleaning, data from 779 children in 18 schools\nwere used to test the hypotheses. Unit nonresponse is still\nconsidered a more serious problem in self-report studies\n(Kivivuori, 2011). Fifty-two percent of the net-sample are\ngirls. Fifteen percent of the respondents live in a single-par-\nent household. Forty-six percent of the respondents have at\nleast one non-Belgian parent. By that, we mean that these\nhouseholds are comprised of at least one parent who is not\nfrom Belgian descent. Forty-nine percent of the pupils were\nattending a school of the Catholic network (i.e., the most\ncommon free subsidized network in Belgium). The other\npupils were either attending community education or offi-\ncially subsidized education.3\nretical population of Ghent elementary schools at the time of\nthe fieldwork. It is rather difficult to address the response\nlevel in relation to the population as many pupils who attend\nschools in Ghent do not live in Ghent. Furthermore, elemen-\ntary schools consist of six grades and data are not available\nper grade. As the sample is a convenience sample, it cannot\nbe seen as a representative sample of Belgian youth, but it is\nsufficiently varied in terms of immigrant background and\neducational level. In random population-based surveys,\nrespondents with an immigrant background are sometimes\nunderrepresented. In our sample, children who live in one-\nparent families, have an immigrant background, and live in\ninner-city areas are slightly overrepresented.\nIn the part-taking schools, unit-nonresponse was consis-\ntently below 2% per school. The consequences of unit-\nnonresponse are well known: Biased results may arise from\nselective unit-nonresponse, but such selection bias is much\nmore problematic when the aim is to extrapolate findings from\nthe school study outside the sample frame. The study of school\nvariation in child antisocial behavior may be less affected as\nthe goal of the study is to detect effects of school-level charac-\nteristics (of the participating schools that exhibit sufficient dif-\nferences in social structure) on pupils' outcomes.\nMeasurement of Key Constructs\nThe questionnaire that was administered to adolescents in\nthe PADS+Panel study (Peterborough Adolescent and Young\nAdult Development Study) of Wikstr\u00f6m and colleagues\n(2012) was used. This questionnaire has been tested on reli-\nability and validity several times (see Wikstr\u00f6m &\nstructs are summative scales of several items; most of them\ncan be regarded as Likert-type scales. Theoretical consider-\nations as well as factor analyses (forced one-factor solutions\nin an exploratory principal-axis factoring analysis) and reli-\nability analyses were used to evaluate the reported scales.\nAlthough the item nonresponse was extremely low per item\n(<2%), imputation to assign acceptable values to missing\ndata (using the expectation\u00admaximization [EM] method)\nwas used to minimize loss of information (L. Pauwels &\nSvensson, 2008).4 First, we discuss the measures of the indi-\nvidual-level variables. The correlations between the vari-\nables can be found in the appendix.\nDependent Variable\nChild antisocial behavior is an overall scale of antisocial\nbehavior that measures a combination of serious and com-\nmon forms of delinquent behavior. It is a general frequency\nscale that is based on the respondents answers on 12 delin-\nquency items that measure how often in the last year they\nhave \"stayed away from school without a valid reason\n(played truant)\"; \"sprayed graffiti on walls, doors, bus stops\nor elsewhere\"; \"thrown in a window\"; \"damaged on purpose\nsomething that does not belong to you, for example, a bicy-\ncle, a bus stop, a street lantern, a traffic sign, a garbage can, .\n. .\"; \"set fire to something on purpose (e.g., a public trash\ncan, a barn, litter, . . .)\"; \"stolen something from a shop that\nis worth less than 5 euros (e.g., candy, a pen, or something\nelse)\"; \"stolen something from a shop that was worth more\nthan 5 euros, for example, clothes, DVDs, or something\nelse\"; \"stolen something that belonged to a classmate, a\nteacher at your school\"; \"stolen money from your parents\";\n\"stolen a bicycle\"; \"taken somebody's wallet, purse, mobile\nphone, or something else\"; and \"used a knife or other weapon\nto scare or threaten somebody.\" Alpha is .80. Although the\nscale contains two subscales, they are analyzed as an overall\nscale for several reasons: Methodologically, although both\nsubscales (Vandalism and Property Offenses) and violent\noffending are highly correlated (r = .80, p < .001), the results\n6 SAGE Open\ndo not differ by dimension, and from a theoretical point of\nview, much evidence exists for the fact that offending among\nchildren and young adolescents is rather versatile (McGloin,\nSullivan, Piquero, & Pratt, 2007). All items were measured\nIndependent Variables\nParental attachment is measured by \"How often do you talk\nto your parents (or stepparents) about how you do in school\nor get along with your friends?\" (answering codes: almost\nnever, a few times a months, a few times a week, and almost\nevery day), \"Do you talk to your parents if you have a prob-\nlem or feel sad about something?\" (no, almost never, some-\ntimes; usually I do, yes, always), \"How often do you\nsomething nice or fun together with your parents?\" (almost\nnever, a few times a year, once or a few times a month, once\nor a few times a week), and \"How often do you eat evening\nmeals together?\" (almost never, a few times a week, several\ntimes a week, and almost every day). Alpha is .66. The items\nwere measured on a 5-point scale ranging from completely\ndisagree to completely agree.\nParental control is a combined index of both parental\nsupervision and perceived parental control. Parental supervi-\nsion measures the degree in which parents know the where-\nabouts of the adolescents (in fact, it indicates the amount of\nadolescent's disclosure to their parents). It consists of three\nitems asking whether the parents of the respondent \"know\nwhere he or she is when out of home,\" \"what he is doing,\" and\n\"with which friends he or she is hanging out.\" Perceived\nparental control indicates how likely it is that parents inter-\nvene in rule-breaking behavior. The measurement consists of\nfour items: \"If you were skipping school, would your parents\ntry to do something about it?\" \"If you had spray-painted graf-\nfiti on the wall of a building, would your parents tell you off\nor punish you?\" \"If you had been beating up or threatening\nsomebody at school, would your parents tell you off or punish\nyou?\" and \"If you showed any disrespect to one of your par-\nents, would he or she tell you off or punish you?\" Alpha is .68\nfor the combined scale. The items were measured on a 5-point\nscale ranging from completely disagree to completely agree.\nMoral beliefs measures the adolescent's attitude toward\nmoral rule breaking. High scores indicate high morality. The\nconstruct is an additive index of the respondent's evaluation\nof 15 situations of potential wrongdoing. Respondents were\nasked to indicate how wrong it is to \"ride a bike through red\nlight\"; \"skip doing homework for school\"; \"skip school or\nwork without an excuse\"; \"lie, disobey, or talk back to teach-\ners\"; \"go skateboarding in a place where skateboarding is not\nallowed\"; \"tease a classmate because of the way he or she\ndresses\"; \"smoke cigarettes\"; \"consuming alcohol\"; \"hit\nanother young person who makes a rude comment\"; \"steal a\npencil from a classmate\"; \"paint graffiti on a house wall\";\n\"smash a street light for fun\"; \"steal a CD from a shop\";\n\"break into or try to break into a building to steal something\";\nand \"use a weapon or force to get money or things from\nanother young person.\" Alpha is .87. The items were mea-\nsured on a 4-point scale (completely disagree, disagree,\nagree, and completely agree).\nAnticipated shame measures the extent to which an ado-\nlescent would feel ashamed toward significant others when\nhe or she would have been caught for committing an offense.\nHigh scores indicate high levels of shame feelings. Four\nitems were used: \"If you were caught shoplifting and your\nbest friends found out about it, would you feel ashamed?\" \"If\nyou were caught shoplifting and your parents found out\nabout it, would you feel ashamed?\" \"If you were caught\ndamaging a car and your best friends found out about it,\nwould you feel ashamed?\" and \"If you were caught damag-\ning a car and your parents found out about it, would you feel\nashamed?Alpha is .82. The items were measured on a 3-point\nscale (1 = no, 2 = yes, and 3 = yes a lot).\nAnticipated guilt measures the extent to which an adoles-\ncent would feel guilty when he or she would have broken\nmoral rules. A high score indicates a high level of guilt. The\nfollowing six items were used: \"Would you feel guilty if you\ndid something your parents (stepparents) have told you abso-\nlutely not to do?\" \"Would you feel guilty if you cheated on a\ntest in school?\" \"Would you feel guilty if you teased another\npupil so he or she started to cry?\" \"Would you feel guilty if\nyou stole something in a shop?\" \"Would you feel guilty if\nyou hit another pupil who made a rude remark to you?\" and\n\"Would you feel guilty if you damaged a car?\" Alpha is .75.\nThe items were measured on a 3-point scale (1 = no, 2 = yes,\nand 3 = yes a lot).\nExposure to peer delinquency measures the amount of\ndelinquent and risky behavior of the adolescent's friends. It\nis measured by an index of six questions about the frequency\nof breaking rules by peers: How often do your friends \"skip\nschool without excuse,\" \"get drunk,\" \"use drugs,\" \"steal\nsomething from others or from shops,\" \"destroy things that\ndo not belong to them,\" and \"beat up or get into fights with\nothers?\" Cronbach's alpha is .70. The items were measured\non a 4-point scale (1 = none of my friends, 2 = few of my\nfriends, 3 = some of my friends, and 4 = [almost] all of my\nfriends).\nSex is coded as 0 for males and 1 for females. Immigrant\nbackground is coded 0 when the child is born in Belgium and\nboth parents are born in Belgium and 1 if at least one of the\nparents were born abroad. Family structure is coded as 0 if\nthe respondent is living with two parents and one if the\nrespondent is living in a single-parent family. Background\nvariables are seen as the background of action, while social\nmechanisms are supposed to account for eventual differ-\nences between demographical categories.\nSchool-level family disruption is the proportion of chil-\ndren who come from a one-parent family, and school-level\nPauwels and Svensson 7\nimmigrant concentration is the proportion of children who\ncome from a family with a non-Belgian background (see\nAnalysis Plan\nAs the respondents are grouped in 18 schools, multilevel\nmodeling is used (Goldstein, 1995; Snijders & Bosker,\n1999). Multilevel modeling is concerned with detecting con-\ntextual statistical effects of higher level characteristics on\nbehavioral and attitudinal outcomes at lower levels, and with\ndiscerning true contextual effects from compositional effects,\nor consequences of segregation or selection. Grouping the\nchildren per class and studying classes as Level 2 units was\nnot considered as the classes do not represent distinct eco-\nlogical settings: Classes are constantly being regrouped,\ndepending on the courses that are given, for example, some-\ntimes Class A and Class B are grouped together, sometimes\nClass B and Class C are grouped together. Thus, in situations\nwhere classes do not represent distinct groups, it might be\nbetter to use another clustering level, which can be inter-\npreted straightforward. The demographic background vari-\nables at the individual level are included to control for\nconfounding compositional effects. In school studies, the\ncontextual effect represents the situation where school char-\nacteristics have a direct effect and can be equated with \"gen-\nuine ecological effects.\" Children differ with regard to their\nfamily structure and schools may differ regarding the propor-\ntion of children who come from a single-parent family and\nwith regard to the percentage of children with an immigrant\nbackground.\nNegative binomial multilevel regression models were\nused to assess the effects of the independent variables on\nself-reported offending (see Table 2). Negative binomial\nregression models are used to model over-dispersed count\ndata (Hilbe, 2011). Such a model fits the distribution of count\ndata such as self-reported offending better than ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) regression models. All beta coefficients are\nunstandardized coefficients of standardized variables. The\nanalyses are run using Mplus 7.3.\nCross-classified multilevel analysis was not considered,\nas this technique demands large neighborhood and school\ncross-classifications. In the present study, the number of\nschools is already rather restricted from the standpoint of\nmultilevel modeling and the number of neighborhoods is\nconsiderably smaller than the number of schools. This is due\nto the fact that in Ghent, schools somewhat tend to be clus-\ntered in some inner-city areas. Under the condition of very\nfew neighborhoods and schools in cross-classified multilevel\nmodels, it is suggested to apply Bayesian bootstrapping tech-\nniques, resulting in robust standard errors (Hox, 2010).\nBesides that methodological argument, it should be stressed\nthat multilevel studies of neighborhoods (defined as census\ntracts or larger areas) have generally failed to demonstrate\ncontextual effects on adolescent offending (Pauwels et al.,\nFindings\nThe empty model represents a multilevel model that only\nincludes the intercept. It is therefore also called an intercept-\nonly model (Hox, 2010). Schools significantly differ from\nTable 1.

N = 779 (Level 1, listwise deletion and scale imputation); n = 18 (Level 2).\n8 SAGE Open\neach other with regard to self-reported offending, in line with\nprevious studies. The random intercept is statistically signifi-\ncant from zero. Model 1 is the statistical model where control\nis held for compositional effects of gender and family struc-\nture. There is still significant variation between elementary\nschools independent of the demographic makeup of the\nschools. Significant effects are found for girls (B = -0.53)\nand immigrant background (B = 0.28). The effects of family\nstructure are only marginally significant (B = 0.25, p < .10).\nModel 2 is a two-level model including two school-level\nvariables: school-level immigrant concentration (not signifi-\ncant) and family disruption (B = 0.28). The analysis suggests\nthat only family disruption is significantly related to child\nantisocial behavior, independent of the demographic compo-\nsition of the schools. Including these Level 2 variables\nchanges the effects of Level 1 variables: Family structure has\nnow lost significance, and immigrant background is only\nmarginally significant (p < .10). Model 3 includes the mech-\nanisms of informal control (parental attachment, the school\nsocial bond, and parental control). Parental control (B =\ncantly and inversely related to child antisocial behavior, while\nparental attachment is not significantly related to self-reported\noffending. The contextual effect of family disruption at the\nschool level (B = 0.28) remains significant and unchanged.\nTherefore, we cannot say that mechanisms of informal con-\ntrol mediate the contextual effect of family disruption. In\nModel 4, we have added moral beliefs, anticipated guilt and\nanticipated shame. These dimensions of morality cannot\naccount for the contextual effect of family disruption. Moral\nbeliefs and moral emotions partially mediate the effects of\nparental control and the school social bond. Moral beliefs (B\n= -0.27), anticipated guilt (B = -0.18) and anticipated shame\n(B = -0.11), have independent effects. The negative binomial\nregression coefficient of moral beliefs is higher than the\nregression coefficients of shame and guilt.\nFinally, exposure to peer delinquency is entered into the\nequation. The introduction of exposure to peer delinquency\ncan fully account for the contextual effect of family disrup-\ntion at the school level. Exposure to peer delinquency (B =\n0.40) also partially accounts for the effects of moral beliefs\nand moral emotions.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe present study assessed the relationship between specific\nconditions of disadvantage at the school and individual level\nand child antisocial behavior. Although self-reported delin-\nquency studies usually sample youth in compulsory secondary\neducation, this survey sampled children in the fifth and sixth\ngrades of the primary compulsory education in Belgium. As\nfar as we know, no other Belgian self-report study of school\ncontextual effects has been conducted among elementary\nschool children. Although the sample is limited to children\nTable 2.

The sample is\ntherefore highly appropriate to identify school contextual\neffects.\nMost of the variation in child antisocial behavior exists\nbetween individuals, rather than between schools. School-\nlevel factors explain only a small amount of the total vari-\nance in child antisocial behavior. This indicates that the\ndifferences in child antisocial behavior are, to a much greater\nextent, due to individual factors rather than the school con-\ntext. But, simultaneously, school-level family disruption has\na moderate direct effect on the school-level differences in\nchild antisocial behavior attending an elementary school in\nan urban context. This effect remains significant when con-\ntrolling for informal controls, moral beliefs, and moral emo-\ntions. The effect is fully accounted for by exposure to peer\ndelinquency.\nStructural background characteristics measured at the\nindividual level are not significantly associated with chil-\ndren's self-reported offending, with the exception of gender.\nMales are more likely to report offending than females, inde-\npendent of their immigrant background and family structure.\nChildren who live in a one-parent family and in families of\nimmigrant background are not likely to have higher levels of\nantisocial behavior than children living in traditional fami-\nlies and children from a fully native family background,\nwhen control is held for gender. Self-report studies usually\nfind small effects of demographic background characteristics\nthat refer to the family social position and structure (see\nWikstr\u00f6m & Butterworth, 2006, for a discussion). This may\nbe due to the fact that family structural background charac-\nteristics are mostly attributes or causes of the causes of anti-\nsocial behavior, that is, they do not bring about action.\nIn general, these findings are in line with previous studies\nthat studied school contextual effects on youths in early ado-\nlescence: Moral beliefs partially mediate the effects of infor-\nmal controls (L. Pauwels, 2013). Moral beliefs and moral\nemotions have direct effects on child antisocial behavior.\nThese results are fully in line with the findings of Svensson\net al. (2013). This study is the first Belgian study that demon-\nstrated the effects of moral emotions on childhood delin-\nquency. Exposure to peer delinquency exhibits the strongest\ndirect effect on child antisocial behavior: This mechanism\nalone was able to account for the school-level variation in\nschool-level family disruption. Exposure to peer delinquency\nwas also able to mediate a substantial part of the effects of\nmoral beliefs and moral feelings.\nThe present study has some important limitations that\nneed to be taken into account when interpreting the results.\nFirst of all, one might wonder to what extent this study\noverestimates the effects of the school context. Indeed, the\npresent study did not simultaneously assess neighborhood\nand school effects. This may seem problematic as poor\nschools may be concentrated in poor neighborhoods.\nHowever, we do not believe that the school effect is overes-\ntimated in our study for a number of reasons. European\ncross-classified multilevel studies that assessed contextual\neffects of neighborhood characteristics (i.e., effects of the\nresidential area where the child lives) and school-level\ncharacteristicsfoundthattheinversewastrue:Neighborhood\neffects either disappear when simultaneously controlling\nfor school effects or turn out to be smaller than school-level\neffects (Oberwittler, 2007). Of course, neighborhood effects\nmay also exist with regard to the school location area. A\ncross-classified analysis (that takes into account the neigh-\nborhood context that refers to the neighborhood where the\nschool is located) was not considered to be a viable alterna-\ntive for a two-level hierarchical multilevel study, due to the\nfact that a number of schools were located in the same\nneighborhood. Our data did not match the criteria for a sta-\nble cross-classified analysis. However, we recognized the\nviability of a potential confounding mechanism and, there-\nfore, we additionally controlled for dummy variables to\ncapture at least a part of this problem. Controlling for cen-\nsus tract characteristics did not lead to the detection of\nneighborhood effects. Similarly, controlling for higher\nlevel areas (postal code areas did not yield any effects\neither) did not yield any effect.\nAlthough we found small but substantial school-level\neffects, it is important for future studies to reconceptualize\ncontextual effects. As recent studies have revealed, it is\nimportant to take into account the area where one really\nspends a lot of leisure time. Contextual effects are best stud-\nied by simultaneously taking into account the amount of time\none actually is exposed to the setting (Wikstr\u00f6m et al., 2012).\nAnother issue is that the present study is cross-sectional\nand therefore causes and effects are measured at one point in\ntime. Although this is still the case in the majority of studies,\nwe believe this is a limitation, especially with regard to the\ncontextual effects. From a theoretical point of view, contex-\ntual effects can be divided into short-term contextual effect\nand long-term developmental effects (Wikstr\u00f6m & Sampson,\n2003). The study of long-term developmental effects requires\npanel studies. Unfortunately, longitudinal studies of school\ncontextual effects on offending are not typically found.\nLongitudinal studies in educational studies have shown\nmuch larger contextual effects than cross-sectional studies. It\nmay thus well be possible that our study underestimates con-\ntextual effects.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Family disadvantage, such as the percentage of children who\nlive in families where unemployment is high, is not measured,\nas a large number of children have no idea about parent's edu-\ncation and employment. Although this may be seen as a short-\ncoming, we know from previous studies that the school level\nof correlation between indicators of disadvantage is fairly\nhigh.\n2. A plethora of moral emotions (shame, guilt, anger, frustration,\netc.) play a central role in guiding people's choice of behav-\nior, and moral emotions are closely linked to moral behaviors\n(Tangney & Dening, 2002; Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek,\n2007). Most empirical research comes from the field of psy-\nchology or sociology. It is important that criminological enqui-\nries catch up with the study of moral emotions in relation to\nantisocial behavior.\n3. To be more precise, 33% of the total sample was attending a\nsubsidized school (i.e., a school subsidized by the municipal\nand provincial authorities). Finally, 18% of the pupils were\nattending a method school (by that we refer to schools based\non a particular educational method, such as Rudolf Steiner\nSchools and Freinet Schools).\n4. Expectation\u00admaximization (EM) imputation was conducted to\navoid an overall loss of respondents. Earlier, L. Pauwels and\nSvensson (2008) compared correlations between nonimputed\nand imputed scale constructs in two different samples and\nfound no substantial effects of item nonresponse on correlations\nbetween variables from theories and measures of juvenile delin-\nquency. Although item nonresponse was only slightly related\nto some demographic background characteristics, these back-\nground characteristics were not able to successfully predict item\nnonresponse on offending items in a series of logistic regres-\nsion models. Therefore, the authors carefully concluded that\nitem nonresponse is not the most serious problem in school\nsurveys of adolescents.\nReferences\nAbell, E., & Gecas, V. (1997).
