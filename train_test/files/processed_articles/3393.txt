    "abstract": "Abstract\nVoting is a complex dynamic driven by the sociopolitical attributes of individuals and how they are spatially located\nin proximity to similar or different populations. In this research note we examine how presidential vote choice is\ninfluenced by the interaction between the population density and racial composition of the ZIP code of respondents in\nthe 2008 and 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies. Our findings reveal interesting patterns with respect to\na respondent's racial background. For whites in racially diverse settings, as density increases, so does support for Obama.\nBy contrast, for blacks the spatial and racial context has almost no effect, providing evidence in support of the claim that\nthis is a group strongly attached to the Democratic Party and its co-racial standard-bearer.\n",

Recent\nscholarship, however, also documents the importance of\nresidential location in shaping people's partisanship (e.g.\nSchuknecht, 2004). For instance, proximity to a different\ngroup might alter and intensify certain political attitudes.\nClose contact with an out-group may foster congruent polit-\nical behavior, while the sizable presence of an out-group in\na spatially segregated setting may breed political conflict.\nWith respect to the contextual influence of place, in addi-\ntion to the traditional urban\u00adrural divide (Gimpel and\nKarnes, 2006), studies also note the importance of suburban\nvoters, whose rise to prominence after the post-World War II\nhousing boom created a large swing group (Gainsborough,\n2005). This development has not been lost on campaigns,\nwhich now assiduously court suburban voters; for while\nthis group is typically seen as pro-Republican, it is only\nmarginally so (McKee and Shaw, 2003) and losses among\nsuburban voters in the collar counties surrounding northern\ncities have recently tilted states such as Michigan,\nPennsylvania, and Wisconsin to the Democrats (Donald\nTrump's 2016 victories in these states notwithstanding).\nA growing interest in suburban voting highlights how\nlittle we know about the shaping of political attitudes and\nbehavior as a consequence of where people live and the\nracial composition of those settings.1 In this research note\nwe examine the interactive relationship between population\ndensity, racial context, and the preferences of black and\nStudy (CCES) data are ideal for testing these dynamics\nDensity, race, and vote choice\npresidential elections\nJeremy M.

The ZIP code (ZC) indicator enables us to assign\nfine grain census data on population density and racial\ncomposition (e.g. percent white) to each survey respondent\nand thus determine if contextual features influence the like-\nlihood of voting for Barack Obama.\nVoting patterns vary a lot as the political landscape\nmoves from the city to the suburb to the country (McKee\nand Teigen, 2009), yet few studies utilize the more exacting\nmeasure of ZIP code-level population density to gauge its\neffect on voter preferences. Rather, studies have relied on\nsimple contrasts between urban, suburban, and rural voters.\nFurther, a location's racial composition can influence vot-\ning behavior but scholars typically ignore its interaction\nIn this study, we eschew coarse urban/suburban/rural dis-\ntinctions and instead assess the role of density and the racial\ncomposition of a respondent's environment in shaping\npresidential voting behavior, particularly given the racial\nprofile of the individual. Controlling for numerous factors,\nZC density registers a marked effect on presidential vote\nchoice, whereas racial composition alone does not. Limiting\nthe analysis to a specific race, we find that blacks appear\nalmost immune to the contextual features of density and\nracial composition. By contrast, white respondents show\nconsiderable sensitivity to density and racial composition:\nindicating racial threat in high-minority/low-density envi-\nronments while embracing Obama's candidacy in high-\nminority/high-density locations.\nData and methods\nWe assign 2010 census data on population density (logged\ndensity per square mile) and racial composition (percent\nwhite; percent black) to the ZIP code of each respondent in\nwith a binary vote choice variable coded: 1 = Obama; 0 =\nMcCain; 1 = Obama; and 0 = Romney. Controls include:\nparty affiliation (Republican, Democrat, independent as\nomitted category); ideology (1 = conservative); race (black,\nLatino, white as omitted category); gender (1 = female);\nmarital status (1 = married); education (1 = college gradu-\nMidwest, Mountains/Plains, Pacific Coast, Northeast as\nomitted category)2 (due to space constraints, age and region\nestimates are not shown in Table 1, but are displayed in\nTable A3 of the online Appendix).3\n(6\u00ad10). The first contains the ZC percent white, the second\nincludes the ZC percent black (excludes ZC percent white\ndue to correlation), the third and fourth interact ZC density\nwith ZC percent white while limiting respondents by race:\nblack and white, respectively. Finally, the fifth model includes\nonly whites and interacts ZC density with ZC percent black.4\nResults\nFirst, we display the distribution of the ZC percent white\nand ZC percent black, respectively for white and black\nestimates follow, and then we show a series of Figures that\nplot the likelihood of voting for Barack Obama among\nblack and white respondents according to ZC density and\ntwo levels of ZC racial composition. Finally, in the last two\nFigures we highlight the notable variation in white voting\nbehavior based on the ZC percent black while comparing\nlow- and high-density areas.\nFigures 1(a) and 1(b) are violin plots of the distribution\nof percent white and percent black population in the ZCs of\nCompared to box plots, violin plots present a richer visual\ndisplay of frequency distributions of the data as they range\nfrom their minimum to maximum values. In Figure 1(a) we\nsee that most white respondents reside in ZCs with high\nwhite populations, whereas black respondents live in set-\ntings with a broader range of percent white residents.\nComplementarily, Figure 1(b) reveals the very low black\npopulation in ZCs inhabited by most whites, while blacks\nlive in ZCs with a decidedly higher variation in the African\nAmerican population.\nTable 1 presents our models of the likelihood of voting for\nwhite ZC percent and Models 2 and 7 include the black ZC\npercent. Neither variable is significant but in these models\ndensity registers a large effect: the increase in voting for\nObama across the density range goes from about 49% in the\nmost sparsely populated ZCs to an over 58% chance of vot-\ning for Obama for respondents in the most densely populated\nareas (see Figures A1\u00adA2 in the online Appendix). Models 3\nand 9 to whites, and each includes an interaction between\ndensity and white ZC percent. This interaction only attains\nsignificance in the whites-only models (4 and 9), but signifi-\ncant differences can register along certain ranges of the inter-\naction so we present predicted probabilities of voting for\nObama in Figures 2(a)\u00ad(d) according to density and two lev-\nels of white ZC percent (low = 20%, high = 95%).\nFigures 2(a)\u00ad(b) present results for black voters in 2008\nmovement in the likelihood of voting for Obama is based\non density and ZC racial composition. Surely Obama him-\nself partly explains this lack of variation in voting behavior,\nbut it also seems African Americans' stalwart Democratic\nsupport (Fauntroy, 2007) is impervious to these contextual\nfactors. The almost inelastic and consensus black vote for\nObama, speaks loudly to the notion of a linked fate/racial\nidentity manifested in vote choice (Dawson, 1994; Tate,\nFigures 2(c)\u00ad(d) present results for white voters in 2008\nTeigen et al. 3\n1.

However,\nin high-minority ZCs, density has a substantial effect on\nwhite voting behavior. There is evidence of both racial\nthreat and the contact hypothesis (Sigelman and Welch,\n1993); that is, whites in rural, high-minority locales exhibit\na very low probability of voting for Obama (racial threat),\nwhereas whites in the most urban (densest), high-minority\nsettings are more likely to vote for Obama than his two\nRepublican opponents (contact hypothesis). Whites spa-\ntially segregated from a high-minority population in a rural\nFigure 1. Distribution of White and Black Zip Code Populations for White and Black Respondents, 2008\u00ad2012.\nFigure 2.

As the ZC\npercent black increases, whites in high-density (urban) set-\ntings show very little movement in the likelihood of voting\nfor Obama (see the probability range in Table A2 in the\nonline Appendix), whereas whites in low-density (rural)\nlocales are decidedly more likely to vote Republican.6\nConclusion\nPolitical observers have long understood that environmen-\ntal factors can have a pronounced effect on voting behavior.\nThe compositional makeup of a location does much to\nexplain its politics, but it is also true that the relative prox-\nimity in which different groups interact shapes the prefer-\nences of voters (Gimpel and Schuknecht, 2004). Where\nindividuals live and who their neighbors are, shapes how\nindividuals vote, even controlling for numerous sociopoliti-\ncal attributes.\nWhite voters exhibit the most political malleability in set-\ntings that vary with respect to density and racial composition.\nable for its resistance to these contextual factors. Perhaps this\nis no surprise because, as a group, African Americans over-\nwhelmingly favor one political party. Nonetheless, the almost\ninelastic voting behavior ofAfricanAmericans when the racial\ncomposition and density of the ZIP code varies is noteworthy.\nAttachment to the Democratic Party and a black President\nseems to explain this. However, future research can make use\nof the 2016 CCES \u00ad the first time this survey will examine\npresidential voting behavior when neither candidate is named\nBarack Obama nor of African American descent \u00ad to confirm\nthis relationship between ZIP code-level density, racial com-\nposition, and voting behavior.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n1. We acknowledge that there is a more substantial literature\ndemonstrating the relationship between residential location\nand political participation (e.g. Oliver, 2001; Welch et al.,\n2.

Note that we are assuming that the population density of an\nindividual's residential location has an impact on voting.\nWhile the causal arrow may point in the opposite direction,\nwe are dubious. Some people may choose to live in places\nwhere a particular (shared) political viewpoint is dominant\n(see Bishop, 2008), but it seems unlikely to us that a particu-\nlar partisan preference would lead to a desire to live within a\ncertain distance from like-minded people.\n5. One might reasonably question whether these effects are\nidiosyncratic to the Obama elections. Given the consistency\nof blacks' support for Democratic presidential candidates in\nrecent \"non-Obama\" elections (blacks went for Clinton by\nGore by 82 points in 2000), it seems likely the general pat-\nterns uncovered here are generalizable to other years.\n6. Regional distinctiveness also explains white voters'tendency\nto prefer Obama. To understand regional differences vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe dynamic between population and racial context, we ran a\nmodel similar to Model 4 in Table 1, but instead of the two-\nway interaction, it included a three-way interaction between\na regional dummy for the South, percent black in respond-\nents' ZC, and population density. In the 2008 presidential\nelection, white southerners living in high-density ZIP codes\n(75 percentile density) became less likely to vote for Obama\nas the number of blacks living around them increased. This\nfinding contrasts with non-southern whites in high-density\nareas, as their preference for Obama was insensitive to their\nracial context. We performed the same analysis for the 2012\npresidential election and found no statistically significant\ndifferences in the voter preferences of southern whites and\nnon-southern whites.\nCarnegie Corporation of New York Grant\nThis publication was made possible (in part) by a grant from\nCarnegie Corporation of New York.
