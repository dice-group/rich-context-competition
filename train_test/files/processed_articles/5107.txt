Patients with mul-\ntiple fractures, or fractures that required a\nsecondary operation for non-union, were\nexcluded from this study. Smokers were also\nexcluded from the study. Institutional ethics\ncommittee approval was obtained from the\nThird Hospital of Hebei Medical University.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients.\nIliac crest bone harvesting\nAn autograft was harvested from the anter-\nior iliac crest in all patients. An incision of\nnearly 7 cm in length was made just below\nthe anterior iliac wing, parallel to the iliac\ncrest and centred over the iliac tubercle.\nNext, the skin was retracted to identify the\niliac crest, and a scalpel was used to create\nan incision down onto the crest by stripping\noff the muscle from either the inner or outer\nwall of the ilium. Following the contour of\nthe bone, a sharp dissection was carefully\nmade to avoid straying out of the plane and\ninto the soft tissue. The dissection was\nextended around the corner of the crest\nonto the ilium using a Cobb elevator to\nobtain a complete 3 \u00c2 2 cm block of the\nilium. Dissection was very carefully per-\nformed to avoid retraction of the inguinal\nligament and a resultant inguinal hernia.\nThe wound was irrigated with antibiotics\nand saline, and soft tissue haemostasis\nwas achieved with bipolar cautery. The\nwound was closed, and internal fixation of\nthe corresponding parts of the fracture\nwas performed. One dose of cefuroxime\n(2.0 g) was given by intravenous administra-\ntion preoperatively, followed by two add-\nitional doses during the first 24 h\npostoperatively.\nAssessment of iliac pain and iliac bone\nregeneration\nPatients self-reported their pain using a\nvisual analogue scale (VAS; 0, no pain; 10,\nworst pain imaginable) at 1 month and 1, 3,\n5 and 10 years postoperatively. Plain radio-\ngraphs of the hip graft site were obtained\npostoperatively, and the status of iliac\nregeneration was determined by two senior\northopaedic trauma physicians (L.Q. and\nY.Z.). The status of iliac regeneration was\ndivided into four levels, based on the com-\nparison with plain preoperative radio-\ngraphs. At level I, the amount of new bone\nvolume was <30% of the original bone\nvolume; at level II, the amount of new\noriginal volume; at level III, the amount of\noriginal volume; at level IV, the amount of\nnew bone volume was >70% of the original\nbone volume. The levels of iliac regeneration\n(I\u00adIV) were given the rank scores of 1, 2, 3\nand 4, respectively.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package,\nversion 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)\nfor Windows\u00d5.\nThe Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-\nrank test were used to generate mean rank\nscores.\nA P-value of <0.05 was considered to be\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThirty-six patients were asked to participate;\nfour patients declined. The mean age of the\nstatus of 30 patients was level 1, and that\nof two patients was level 2 because of\ncontrolled hypertension. Of the 32 patients,\nthe autologous iliac crest bone of seven\npatients was used for humeral shaft fracture\ntransplantation, that of 20 patients was used\nfor femoral shaft fracture transplantation,\nthat of three patients was used for tibial\nshaft fracture transplantation, and that of\ntwo patients was used for radial and ulnar\nfracture transplantation. No postoperative\ninfections occurred in any patient. All frac-\ntures had healed by 9 months postopera-\ntively (range 6\u00ad13 months). All patients\nreturned to their previous activities or\noccupations.\nResults of the iliac regeneration status\nanalysis, including mean rank scores for iliac\nregeneration at different timepoints over the\nstudy period, are shown in Table 1. Pairwise\ncomparison using Wilcoxon signed-rank test\nstatistically significant compared with the\npreoperative bone volume (P < 0.001 for all\ncomparisons). After 10 years, the amount of\nnew bone in seven patients was >70% of the\noriginal bone volume (level IV iliac regener-\nation; Table 1).\nResults of the VAS scoring for pain at the\ndonor site are shown in Table 2. The mean\nrespectively. Pairwise comparison using\nshowed no statistically significant difference\nbetween 1 month and 1 year. However, there\nwere statistically significant differences\nbetween the other pairwise comparisons\n(P < 0.05 for all comparisons).\nDiscussion\nIliac crest autografting is considered to be\nthe gold standard grafting technique in\nfracture internal fixation procedures and in\nsome spinal fusion surgeries.1 Harvesting of\nthe iliac crest graft is associated with mor-\nbidity, particularly persistent pain at the\ngraft harvest site, in up to one-third of\npatients.4,5 However, the most recent studies\nhave reported incidences of relevant pain\nwith a follow-up of 3 years.5\nTable 1. Status of postoperative bone regener-\nation at the iliac crest bone graft donor site, as\ndetermined by two senior orthopaedic trauma\nphysicians, based on comparison with plain\npreoperative radiographs, in patients (n \u00bc 32) who\nunderwent iliac crest bone graft harvesting.\nBone regeneration\nlevela\nPostoperative time, years\nData presented as n of patients unless otherwise stated.\naStatus of iliac regeneration was divided into four levels:\nlevel I, amount of new bone volume <30% of original bone\nvolume; level II, amount of new bone volume !30 but\n50% of its original volume; level III \u00ad the amount of new\nbone volume was >50% to 70% of its original volume;\nlevel IV, amount of new bone volume was >70% of original\nbone volume.\nbLevels of iliac regeneration (I\u00adIV) were given mean rank\ncP < 0.001 for all postoperative comparisons; Friedman\ntest and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\nThe present study is is the first prospect-\nive study to examine pain and bone regen-\neration with a follow-up of 10 years. In this\nstudy, we found that pain was significantly\nlower 3 years postoperatively compared\nwith 1 year postoperatively. This reduction\nin pain was primarily exhibited because\nfewer patients reported severe pain as the\npostoperative time increased. This result\nmay affect the number of orthopaedic sur-\ngeons who propose reconstruction of the\niliac crest to reduce pain.\nSeveral methods to reduce graft site\npain are currently available. For example,\nTanishima et al.6 recommended rounding\noff the graft harvest site edges.\nReconstruction of the graft site with resorb-\nable mesh has been shown to reduce early\npostoperative pain.7 Continuous application\nof 0.2% ropivacaine through an iliac crest\ncatheter with iliac crest bone grafting was\ndemonstrated to be an effective method for\npain relief for the first 48 h, and the benefit of\nthis technique was still present after\n3 months.8 However, most of these were\nretrospective studies with shorter follow-up\ntimes, which seriously affected their cred-\nibility. This present study revealed a declin-\ning trend in pain, which appeared to have\nstarted 3 years postoperatively, suggesting\nthat pain relief does not require ilium\nreconstruction.\nThis present study also observed the\nphenomenon of bone regeneration. The\nresults demonstrated that the ilium exhibited\na good ability to repair itself in the long term.\nThis was perhaps related to the choice of\npatients, who were younger people (aged\nical comorbidities (ASA physical status of\n1 or 2). This present study selected younger\nrather than older patients with spinal dis-\neases to ensure successful completion of a 10-\nyear follow-up; thus, the extent of iliac\nregeneration may have been exaggerated in\nthis study. This present study sought to\ndetermine whether bone regrowth at the\nharvest site was associated with pain relief,\nbut it was unable to determine this because\nthe sample size was too small. This problem\nrequires further investigation in a multi-\ncentre prospective study with a larger\nsample size.\nIn conclusion, this present study demon-\nstrated that the iliac crest bone graft donor\nsite showed a declining trend in pain over the\nfollow-up period, which may have started at\n3 years postoperatively. Analysis of plain\nradiographs demonstrated that the ilium\nwas readily able to repair itself over the\nlong term.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nTable 2.
