The situation has worsened with time due to the increasing popu-\nlation. This article investigates the causes behind the accidents and provides recommen-\ndations and measures that would bring forth an improvement in the traffic conditions.\nThe research uses forecasting models to confirm the existence of traffic problem in the\nState of Kerala. The various reasons for the accidents were enumerated and classified.\nUsing regression models, the relationship between the number of accidents, deaths,\nand injured were obtained. In addition, the relationship between the number of acci-\ndents and the number of vehicles on road were examined along with the type of vehicle,\ndesign of the roads, the design of traffic, and the design of road network.\nIn addition, a simulation model is presented to study the effect of the change in design\nof roads on the traffic situation. As an example, a 15-minute time period can be used\nto count the number of vehicles of each type (buses, cars, and trucks) travelling in\nboth directions on a major highway. This data can then be categorized into slow and\nfast moving traffic. The Mean time between arrivals, percentages of slow and fast\nvehicles, percentages of vehicles travelling in both directions can be calculated and used\nin ARENA simulation software to perform discrete event simulation. Various scenarios\nare simulated; and waiting times and potential number of accidents are found for each\nof the scenarios.\nBased on forecasting, regression and simulation models, this article provides several\nrecommendations and managerial insights, which are believed to alleviate the traffic\nproblems in the State of Kerala. The solution approaches from this research could be\nused for addressing similar traffic situations in other states of India, which could result\nin saving millions of lives over the next decade.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nKerala has been facing traffic related issues for\ndecades. The situation has worsened with time\ndue to the increasing population. In the recent\npast, a project sponsored by the World Bank announced\nan award to any organization or an individual, who\ncould successfully address the traffic situation in the\nstate. Subsequently, IBS Software Services developed\na software system for the police department to help\nidentify the traffic problems. However, the system did\nnot help significantly in reducing the number of acci-\nan attempt to investigate the causes behind the acci-\ndents and provides recommendations and measures\nthat would bring forth a reduction in traffic accidents\nin Kerala.\nThere is extensive literature in the area of fatalities\nrelated to traffic. We first present the research articles\nfrom the Western countries and then discuss those from\nIndia, as the vehicle types and traffic conditions are\nsignificantly different in both contexts.\ndents in 10 UK police jurisdictions during the years\nof accidents were excessive speeding and drunken\ndriving with the drivers having alcohol levels beyond\nthe permissible limit. In addition, the young age of\nthe drivers, driving in the night, and the failure to\nwear seat belt are contributors to these fatalities.\nfatal injury in a road traffic accident was estimated using\nlogistic regression adjusting for gender, age, season of\nthe year, and time of the week. They showed that the\nrisk for fatal accidents was high with intake of multiple\ndrugs or alcohol by the drivers. Spoerri, Egger, and Von\n(2011) examined socio-demographic and geograph-\nical determinants of road traffic accident mortality\nin Switzerland by linking 2000 census data to the\naccidental deaths were analysed, including 978 deaths\npedestrians. Weibull survival models and Bayesian\nmethods were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and\nstandardized mortality ratios (SMR) across study\nareas. They showed a u-shaped relationship with age\nin motor vehicle occupants and motorcyclists. For\ncyclists and pedestrians, mortality increased after the\nage of 55 years. Mortality as a function of education\n(primary, tertiary) and civil status (single, married) was\nalso discussed. They suggested that preventive efforts\nshould aim to reduce inequities across socio-demo-\ngraphic and educational groups, and across geograph-\nical areas, with interventions targeted at high-risk\ngroups. Ayuso, Guill\u00e9n, and Alca\u00f1iz (2010) used multi-\nnomial logistic regression to analyse accidents with\nvictims and calculate the influence of different types of\ntraffic violations on the probability of having a serious\nor fatal accident, compared to a smaller accident. The\ndata for this study was based on accidents that occurred\nand the average number of victims per accident were\nthen used to find the estimated cost of an accident with\nvictims, given the information on the type of traffic\nviolation incurred. They presented some recommenda-\ntions on the severity of penalties, and suggested that\nregulators penalize the occurrences of some specific\ncombinations of traffic violations more rigorously.\nIn the Indian context, Mohan and Bawa (1985)\nattempted to understand fatal crash patterns in Delhi in\nthe 1980s. The results of the study indicated that fatality\npatterns in Delhi were different from those in highly\nindustrialized countries. Pedestrians, two-wheeler\nriders, and bus commuters comprised 80 per cent of the\nfatalities while motor-vehicle occupants comprised a\nsmall minority. The authors proposed some short-term\nand long-term safety countermeasures for Delhi which\nwere significantly different from those in more indus-\ntrialized high-income countries. Sahdev et al. (1994)\nundertook a study of road traffic fatalities in South\nDelhi to determine the injury patterns and incidence of\ndeaths that could be prevented by optimal utilization of\navailable medical resources. According to them, the\nmajorityofthepreventabledeathsresultedfromafailureto\ndiagnose or treat an injury and that an improvement\nin hospital management of intracavitory hemorrhage\nstudied the different factors influencing the fatality of\ninjury among two-wheeler motor accidents. One key\nobservation was that the helmet users had a much lower\nincidence and severity of head injury than the riders\nwho did not use helmets. Jain et al. (2009) studied the\ntrend of two-wheeler accidents over the period, 2000\u00ad\n2004, with respect to age and sex of the victim, type\nof injury sustained, type of vehicle involved, and time\ncent of the victims were in the age group of 18\u00ad44 years,\nand the accident rate among males (83 per cent) was\nhigher than those among females (17 per cent). They\nfurther concluded that the highest number of accidents\noccurred at a certain time of the day (6 p.m.\u00ad10 p.m.).\nThis article contains three separate areas of analysis\nthat are linked to each other in the following order:\n(1) The first step was to evaluate the existing traffic acci-\ndent problem in Kerala. This consisted of forecasting\nthe number of accidents, number of people died in\naccidents, and number of people injured in acci-\ndents, using standard forecasting techniques. Time\nseries models such as Moving Averages, Single and\nDouble Exponential Smoothing, Winters' Method,\nand Neural Networks were used.\n(2) The second step was to verify the impact of acci-\ndents. This was achieved by regressing the number\nof accidents with the number of deaths and the\nnumber of injured.\nOnce the impact of accidents was measured, the\nfactors contributing to the increase in the number of\naccidents were determined. To achieve this, regres-\nsion analysis was performed with the number of\naccidents against the vehicle type, the number of\nvehicles, and the density of vehicles. In addition,\nregression was used to identify the relationship\nbetween the increasing number of vehicles on the\nroads and the accidents. Using data from all the\nstates in India, another set of regression was done\nwith the number of deaths against the number and\ntype of vehicle. When the number of vehicles did\nnot give a good regression coefficient, various trans-\nformations were applied on the number of vehicles,\nin search of a higher regression coefficient.\nPareto analysis of accidents vs. vehicle type was\nused to determine the highest contributors to the\naccidents by vehicle type, and this information\nwas then used in the regression analysis of vehicle\ntype vs. number of deaths. The Pareto analysis also\nranked the accidents by vehicle type which helped\nin focusing on accident causing vehicles.\n(3) The third step was to present a simulation method-\nology to redesign the road network which would\nreduce the traffic accidents significantly on national\nhighways. We used Discrete Event Simulation models\nto study the effect of the change in the design of roads,\ntraffic, and road networks on the traffic accidents.\nHere, the dataset was obtained by direct observation\nof traffic on a national highway. A 15-minute time\nperiod was used to count the number of vehicles of\neach type (buses, cars, and trucks) travelling in both\ndirections on NH-47, a major highway in Kerala. This\ndata was then categorized into slow and fast moving\ntraffic. The mean time between arrivals, percentages\nof slow and fast vehicles, and percentages of vehicles\ntravelling in both directions were calculated and used\nin ARENA simulation software to perform discrete\nevent simulation. Various scenarios were simulated;\nand waiting times and potential number of accidents\nwere found for each of the scenarios. Based on the\nanalysis of these scenarios, we present several recom-\nmendations and trade-offs.\nDATA\nThe data on road accidents, the number of deaths in\naccidents, and the number of people injured in acci-\ndents were obtained from online sources such as: Public\nWorks Department, Government of Kerala and the\nKerala State Crime Records Bureau. (Edayaranmula,\nThe data collected from these sources were used for\nperforming statistical analysis and making recommen-\ndations for reducing traffic accidents using forecasting,\nregression, and simulation models discussed above.\nANALYSIS\nAn analysis of the number of accidents, deaths, and\ninjuries in accidents, using forecasting, regression and\nsimulation techniques are presented below.\nForecast of Accidents\nThe data on the number of accidents in Kerala from\n1, Appendix I). The number of accidents was forecasted\nbased on the publicly available data from the State\nCrime Records Bureau, Kerala Police (Edayaranmula,\n2005). A summary of errors for the various forecasting\nmethods used to forecast accidents is given in Table 1.\nTable 1: Summary of errors \u00ad Forecast of accidents\n  method MAD MAPE\nSource: Authors' analysis.\nNotes: MAD = Median Absolute Deviation; MAPE = Mean Absolute\nPercentage Error.\nFrom Table 1, neural network method appears to be\nthe best method for forecasting. The forecasting exer-\ncise indicates an increase in the number of accidents--\n2017; (Table 1a, Appendix I). If no measures are taken,\nthe number of accidents will continue to increase.\nForecast of Number of Deaths in Accidents\nThe number of deaths in traffic accidents in Kerala was\nforecasted with the same data and techniques used for\nforecasting the number of accidents. The actual data on\nthe number of deaths has an upward trend from 1990 to\nI, Table 1b). A summary of errors for the various fore-\ncasting methods used to forecast the number of deaths\nin the accidents is given in Table 2.\nTable 2: Summary of errors \u00ad Forecast of number of deaths in\naccidents\n  method MAD MAPE\nSource: Authors' analysis.\nIt can be inferred from Table 2 that neural network fore-\ncasting is the most appropriate method. The forecast\nusing this method indicates that the number of deaths\nin accidents would remain at more than 3,000 per year\nfor the next 10 years (Appendix I, Table 1b). The actual\nsubstantiates this forecast.\nForecast of Number Injured in Accidents\nThe actual data on the number of injured in accidents\nI). A summary of errors for the various forecasting\nmethods used to forecast the number injured in the\naccidents is given in Table 3.\nTable 3: Summary of errors \u00ad Forecast of number injured in\naccidents\n  method MAD MAPE\nSource: Authors' analysis.\nBased on the above MAD and MAPE, Single Exponen-\ntial Smoothing method appears to be the most accurate.\nThe forecasts using this method as well as the Neural\nNetwork method indicates that there is no significant\ndecrease in the number of people injured over a span\n \nNumber of Accidents vs. Number of Deaths\nA regression analysis was performed to understand\nthe relationship between Number of accidents and\nNumber of deaths. An R-Square of 94.9 per cent\nconfirms the general understanding that accident\ndeaths are correlated to the number of accidents. The\nregression equation is:\nThis shows that the number of deaths increases with\nthe increase in accidents (See Table 2a, Appendix I for\nsummary regression output).\nNumber of Accidents vs. Number of Injured\nAn R-Square of 96.32 per cent confirms that accident\ninjuries are correlated to the number of accidents. The\nregression equation is:\naccidents\nThis shows that injuries increase with the increase in\nthe number of accidents (See Table 2b, Appendix I for\nsummary regression output).\nPareto Analysis--Accidents vs. Vehicle Type\nFigure 1 demonstrates the results of the Pareto analysis\nof the publicly available data (NATPAC, n.d.) to inves-\ntigate the correlation between the number of accidents\nand the vehicle type.\nAs can be seen from the Pareto chart, two-wheelers\ncontribute to 41.4 per cent of the accidents. Auto-\nrickshaws, cars, and private buses, add up to make 79.2\nper cent of all accidents.\nVehicle Type vs. Number of Deaths\nThe R-square was significant only in one case;\ntwo-wheelers, at 87.9 per cent, indicating a high corre-\nlation between two-wheelers and the number of deaths\nin accidents (Table 2c, Appendix I). The regression\nequation is:\ntwo-wheelers.\nReciprocal of Vehicles vs. Number of Accidents\nA regression was run to determine the correlation\nbetween the number of accidents and the number\nof vehicles on the roads. As this did not yield an\nR-square of more than 80 per cent, regressions were\ntried with various transformations on the number of\nvehicles, which included squaring, taking a square\nroot, using logarithm and a reciprocal. The regres-\nsion with the reciprocal was the only transformation\nthat yielded an R-square close to 80 per cent (Table\n2d, Appendix I).\nThe regression equation is:\nvehicles.\nThe R-square obtained (78.9 per cent) shows a high\ncorrelation between the reciprocal of the number of\nvehicles and the number of accidents.\nVehicles per km vs. Number of Accidents\nThe R-square of 83.4 per cent indicates a high correla-\ntion between the number of vehicles per kilometre and\nthe number of accidents (Table 2e, Appendix I).\nFigure 1: Pareto chart of accidents vs. vehicle types\nSource: Authors' analysis.\nSimulation\nBased on the findings of the regression methodology, a\nsimulation model is presented here to redesign the roads,\ntraffic, and the road network, that could help reduce the\ntraffic accidents significantly on national highways.\nThe goal of the simulation model was to reduce the\nnumber of unsuccessful switches by redesigning traffic\nand/or roads, and at the same time minimizing the\nwaiting time.\nA two-lane highway is defined as one that has traffic\nin both directions (one lane going North and one lane\nSouth). The traffic rules do not legally allow vehicles to\npass other vehicles by switching temporarily to the lane\nwith incoming traffic. However, many vehicles do not\nadhere to these rules. Typically, they tend to pass the\nvehicle in the same lane, by crossing into the lane in the\nopposite direction. It then tries to switch back to the orig-\ninal lane, which cannot be accomplished, if the original\nlane is busy. All of this slows down the traffic resulting\nin traffic congestion, or may lead to a head-on collision.\nMain Features of the Model\nThe simulation was modelled using ARENA soft-\nware. The lanes were considered as resources. Each\nresource could accommodate only one vehicle at a\ntime. Slow vehicles took a longer time to be processed\nwhen compared to the fast moving vehicles. Direction,\nlane, speed (1 or 2), and entity type were assigned.\nIf the lane (resource) was busy, the vehicle switched.\nThe false branch from the next switch decision within\na decide module gave rise to a number that we called\n\"possible accidents.\" The objective was to reduce that\nnumber without significantly increasing the waiting\ntime of the vehicles. The following five scenarios were\nconsidered: Base, No passing at all, No passing for slow\ntraffic, Passing only for North-bound fast traffic, and\nFour-lane highway (implies upgrading and rede-\nsigning of the highway). The fifth scenario required a\nseparate model. Refer to Appendix II for an illustration\nof the simulation models.\nMajor Data Needed (Input)\nThe following data was needed for simulating the\nscenarios in ARENA: (1) Mean time between arrivals of\nvehicles (both South-bound and North-bound); (2) The\nfraction of slow and fast vehicles (both South-bound\nand North-bound); (3) The process or value added\ntimes for slow and fast traffic (assumed to be 8 and 3\nseconds, respectively); (4) The switch or transfer times\n(assumed to be 2 seconds).\nKey Performance Measures (Output)\nThe following key performance measures were consid-\nered: (1) Waiting time for each entity type (categorized\nby direction, speed and lane); (2) Total time for each\nentity type that includes value added, waiting and\ntransfer times; (3) Possible accidents.\nData Collected by Direct Observation\nDifferent types of vehicles were counted by physically\nduring three different weekdays on NH-47 between\nThrissur and Palakkad. This data was used to calcu-\nlate the mean time between arrivals, as well as the\npercentage of slow and fast vehicles in both directions.\nSimulation Results\nThe base scenario reflects the existing traffic situation\nand places no restriction on overtaking. Although the\nwaiting time is the lowest for this scenario, it is the\nmain reason behind traffic accidents on the highways.\nThe second scenario is where no passing is allowed.\nThis yields the highest waiting times, but presumably\nwould result in zero accidents. So, the traffic was cate-\ngorized into fast (tempos, KSRTC buses, private buses,\ncars, and two-wheelers) and slow vehicles (trucks).\nThe third scenario is to allow fast vehicles to pass and\nprohibit slow vehicles from overtaking. This seems to\nbe a good trade-off as it can be seen from the waiting\ntimes and the total travel time on the highway. The\nfourth scenario allows only fast North-bound vehicles\nto pass. North-bound was chosen because it has more\ntraffic than South-bound. Nevertheless, as it can be seen\nfrom the simulation results, this significantly increases\nthe waiting times for the South-bound traffic.\n\"Possible accident\" implies that a vehicle that has\nswitched to the opposite lane would not be able to\ncome back to the original lane due to traffic. This\nwould lead to two possible scenarios: (1) The vehicle\nwould wait to get into the original lane and as a result it\nwould force the traffic in the opposite direction to wait.\n(2) It would collide head-on with the vehicle coming\nfrom the opposite direction. \"Possible accidents\" are\nhighest for the base scenario and none for the second\nscenario (where no passing is allowed). Even though\nthe second scenario is preferred, it leads to increased\nwaiting times. The third scenario looks promising, as\nit reduces potential accidents by 17 per cent without\nsignificantly increasing waiting times. While the fourth\nscenario reduces potential accidents by 47 per cent, this\nsolution may not be acceptable to the commuters trav-\nelling South-bound.\nTherefore, the third scenario (prohibiting slow vehi-\ncles like trucks from passing) seems to be the best\noption, but it still results in accidents. Thus we recom-\nmend Scenario 5, where we upgrade two-lane high-\nways to four lanes (with two lanes in each direction).\nThis decreases waiting times, eliminates head-on colli-\nsions, and reduces the \"Possible accidents\". Scenario 5\ncould be expensive to implement due to the high costs\ninvolved in building the new lanes (construction, main-\ntenance, land acquisition), as well as the relocation costs\nfor residents living near the highways. See Appendix\nIII for detailed simulation results.\nRecommendations\nDesign of Roads\nDesign of roads is an aspect worth reviewing in order\nto reduce accidents on the roads of Kerala.\nConversion of one-way highway to a four-lane\nhighway (two lanes in each direction) is one solution\nthat can ease traffic accidents. The simulation model\nsupports this by showing that the waiting time is\nreduced significantly. The simulation also shows the\ncomplete absence of the module \"possible accidents\".\nThe possibility of head-on collision is brought to zero\nin this model, because the rule permits changing lanes\nin the same direction as the traffic. Nonetheless, the\ntrade-offs involved with increasing one-way to a four-\nlane highway cannot be neglected. Apart from the huge\ncost of construction and maintenance of the highway,\nland acquisition for expansion has cost, effort, time,\nlegal and ethical implications.\nDesign of Traffic\nConsidering the problems in redesigning of the roads,\nredesigning of traffic seems more feasible. We now\nexperiment with simulation models that implement\nrestrictions on overtaking, conditionally and uncondi-\ntionally. In this set of models, restrictions are imposed\non passing (changing to the opposite lane while\novertaking). Currently, there are no restrictions on\npassing and any vehicle can pass any other vehicle at\nany time. This is the base scenario for the simulation.\nIn this scenario, if a vehicle sees another vehicle in the\nsame lane, it tries to overtake that vehicle by changing\nto the lane with on-coming traffic (provided there is no\nvehicle in that lane). After switching to the opposite\nlane, it is necessary that they come back to the original\nlane immediately. However, the original lane may not\nhave space for this vehicle, and that may result in two\npossible scenarios: Either this vehicle waits for the orig-\ninal lane to be available or it collides head-on with the\nvehicle from the on-coming traffic. In the first scenario,\nit slows down the traffic, sometimes confusing vehi-\ncles in the opposite lane, and even the vehicles in the\noriginal lane. The second scenario results in a head-on\ncollision. Combined, these two scenarios constitute\nthe module \"potential accidents\". The objective of the\nsimulation experiments is to minimize this number.\nThere are three variations from the base scenario. The\nfirst is where no passing is allowed for any vehicle.\nEven though this solution results in zero \"potential\naccidents\", it would be rejected by the public because\nit adds to the waiting time of the fast moving vehicles.\nAnother experiment allows passing only for fast vehi-\ncles in one direction (in this case, North-bound) that has\nhigher traffic. But this was found to increase waiting\ntimes for South-bound traffic significantly. Thus, a\nreasonably good solution implied placing restriction\non just the slow moving traffic.\nAn advantage of redesigning the traffic lies in the\nopportunity to implement changes that address the\npeak hour traffic, and any condition specific to the\nroads in consideration. Even though only highway\ntraffic was studied for the simulation, with additional\nappropriate data, the results could be applied to state\nhighways as well.\nThe Pareto analysis indicates that two-wheelers are\ninvolved in 41.4 per cent of the accidents. The regres-\nsion analysis also revealed a high correlation (R-square\n= 87.9 per cent) between two-wheelers and the number\nof deaths. The corresponding regression equation is:\ntwo-wheelers.\nThe above results indicate the significant role of\ntwo-wheelers in accidents. So, a possible solution is\nto have a separate lane for two-wheelers which may\ncontribute significantly to the efforts of reducing the\nnumber of accidents. This would not incur huge costs,\nas it would involve reserving a part of the existing road\nspace for two-wheelers.\nDesign of  \nA couple of regressions were run to determine the\ncorrelation between the number of vehicles and acci-\ndents. An R-Square close to 80 per cent was found\nbetween the reciprocal of the number of registered\nvehicles and the number of accidents (Table 2d,\nAppendix I). An R-square of more than 83 per cent\nwas discovered between the number of vehicles per\nkilometre and the number of accidents (Table 2e,\nAppendix I). The main reason behind traffic acci-\ndents was the significant increase in the number of\nvehicles without a corresponding increase in the road\nspace. Thus, more roads need to be constructed, espe-\ncially from the suburbs to the city. This would result\nin commuters taking different routes, and therefore,\nreducing traffic accidents.\nThe Kerala expressway was planned to connect the\ntips of Kerala's northern and southern boundaries.\nThis would benefit business and regular commuters.\nUnfortunately, the construction work is moving at\na slow pace, as the infrastructure costs are extremely\nhigh; therefore, enhancing existing roads seems to be a\nbetter option.\nThe redesign of traffic provides an opportunity to\nimplement changes that address the peak hour traffic.\nEven though only national highway traffic was studied\nfor the simulation, with additional appropriate data,\nthe results could be applied to state highways as well.\nDesign of  \nThe regression results show significant correlation\nbetween the number of vehicles and accidents, the\nnumber of vehicles per kilometre and the number of\naccidents. The main reason behind traffic accidents\nis the significant increase in the number of vehicles\nwithout a corresponding increase in the road space.\nThus, more roads need to be constructed, especially\nfrom the suburbs to the city. This would result in\ncommuters taking different routes, thereby reducing\ntraffic accidents. The planned addition of over 12,000\nkilometres of expressways in the next 10 years may\nhelp address some of such issues (Wikipedia, n.d.).\nDue to high construction costs and the amount of\ntime taken to build new expressways, we recommend\nenhancing the existing roads.\nThough the following factors are not part of our research\nstudy, we briefly mention these miscellaneous recom-\nmendations that deserve consideration and could be a\npart of future research topic.\nThe Time of Day\nThe increase in accidents at night seems to be concen-\ntrated in two districts in Kerala and therefore further\ninvestigation in this area is required.\nEnforcing Traffic Rules\nThe drivers and pedestrians should comply with\nthe traffic rules and this must be strictly enforced.\nFor instance, it is not uncommon to see two adults\nand two children on a two-wheeler, where only 2\nadults and 1 child are legally allowed to travel by a\ntwo-wheeler. Further, concerned over the rising number\nof two-wheeler accidents, the Kerala High Court has\nsuggested an amendment of the Motor Vehicles Act and\nRules, prohibiting women in sarees from riding pillion\non two wheelers and carrying more than one child on\nEmergency Calling System\nHaving an efficient emergency calling system like the\ngency services to all the states across India (currently\noperational in about 20 states and two Union Territories\nin India), might help decrease the number of deaths\nand injured in accidents.\nProhibition of Alcohol\nAstudyconductedbytheAlcoholandDrugInformation\nCentre (ADIC) has revealed that around 40 per cent of\nthe road accidents in India in general and 72 per cent\non the national highways are due to drunk driving\n(Edayaranmula, 2005). Kerala has one of the highest\nper capita consumption of alcohol in the country.\nProhibition of alcohol may help reduce the road acci-\ndents to a great extent.\nImprovement in Quality of Roads\nDefective road condition affects two-wheelers the\nmost and there could be a correlation between bad\nroad conditions and two-wheeler accidents. Thus, it is\nsuggested to construct better roads with quality mate-\nrials and increase the frequency of road maintenance.\nEnhancing Efficiency of Police:\nDespite the fact that speeding and traffic violations are\nvery common, the commuters are not held accountable\nfor these violations like in western countries such as the\nUnited States. A large and efficient police force can help\nin strict implementation of laws for safety.\nCurbing Corruption\nCorruption may be in the form of bribing officials for\ngranting drivers' licence without taking the road test.\nThere should be a process to strictly enforce the licensing\nprocedure and take action against corrupt officials.\nTo conclude, the traffic accident situation in Kerala is\nprojected to worsen over the years based on the fore-\ncast of accidents and the number of deaths and injured\nin accidents. Among the different contributing factors,\ntwo-wheelers and vehicle overtaking are found to be the\nprimary factors causing accidents. This research finds\nthat redesign of the traffic is an effective way to address\nthese two issues. We recommend reserving a separate\nlane for two-wheelers in suburbs and cities, and strictly\nenforcing the helmet law. For commuters on highways, it\nis recommended to implement restrictions on overtaking\nbased on the speed of the vehicle and traffic specific to\nthat region. The other recommendations are to improve\nthe condition of roads and upgrading the two-lane high-\nways to four-lane highways. We believe this would\neffectively address the traffic accidents currently faced\nby the state of Kerala.\nThe simulation models discussed in this article could\nbe extended to include \"the time of the day when\naccidents occur\" besides the other miscellaneous\nfactors discussed in the article as potential areas of\nfuture research. In addition, this methodology could\nbe used for addressing similar traffic situations in\nother states/cities of India (Transport Research Wing,\nmanagerial insights might alleviate the traffic accidents\nin the country.\n"
