A central feature of dietary\nintake of free-living individuals is the daily variation\nsuperimposed on an underlying consistent pattern (Willett,\n1990). For most epidemiologic studies, long-term diet\nrather than intake on any speci\u00aec day is the exposure of\ninterest. Estimates of long-term diet may be obtained by\nusing dietary assessment methods such as food frequency\nquestionnaires. In many situations, however, food intakes\nduring one or more days are measured. The effect of this is\nto increase the standard deviation of intakes, that is, the\nobserved distribution has values that are higher and lower\nthan the true average for any subject (Willett, 1990).\nClearly, the dif\u00aeculty in obtaining accurate dietary data\nfrom study population presents a major challenge in the\nepidemiologic study of diet\u00b1disease relationship.\nMeasurement errors and its effects on the statistical\nestimates and tests of hypotheses have been studied exten-\nNakamura, 1990). In the area of nutrition, the nature of\nvariation in dietary intake and the measurement error\ncaused by such variation have also been studied (Beaton\nPlummer & Clayton, 1993). The within-person error caused\nby daily variation in intake above and below individual's\ntrue long-term intake has been studied in detail. It is the\nmajor source of error in dietary data, although its magni-\ntude varies by nutrient. Macronutrients tend to vary less\nbecause they make large contributions to total energy\nintake. Micronutrients tend to vary more because they are\noften concentrated in certain foods, and their intakes are\nstrongly in\u00afuenced by food choices for the day (Willett,\nMeasurement errors in dietary data can be thought of as\nrandom and systematic (Willett, 1990). For random errors,\nthe average value of many repeated measurements\napproaches the true value. Each or both may occur at two\nlevels: within a person and between persons. Random\nwithin-person error is exempli\u00aeed by the day-to-day varia-\ntion in food intake, as described above. It is the major\nsource of error in dietary data and it is the focus of this\npaper. Random between-person error may be caused by\nusing only a few measurements per subject in the presence\nof random within-person error. Systematic within-person\nerror is best typi\u00aeed by under-reporting or over-reporting of\nintake by some individuals, and systematic between-person\nerror results from systematic within-person error that\naffects subjects nonrandomly. For example, using incorrect\nnutrient composition values for some foods may appear to\naffect all individuals in the same direction, but their\nimpacts are not the same since consumption of these\nCorrespondence: Dr BM Popkin, Carolina Population Center, University\nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University Square, 123 W. Franklin\nhttp://www.stockton-press.co.uk/ejcn\nfoods is likely to differ among subjects (Willett, 1990). To\ndate, there is no formal way to deal with systematic errors.\nOther forms of error exist, such as those caused by mistakes\nin reporting and recording of food intake by respondents\nand interviewers. These types of error can not be corrected.\nThe following discussion focuses on the random within-\nperson error in dietary data that can distort the diet\u00b1disease\nassociation of interest. Generally, the effect of this error is\nto attenuate the strength of association, causing the correla-\ntion or regression coef\u00aecient to be biased toward zero\nnized, and there are studies that have empirically demon-\nstrated such effect of measurement error on diet\u00b1disease\nMethods to adjust for the within-person error are available.\nHowever, their use in the epidemiologic study of the diet-\ndisease relationship has been limited.\nIn this paper, we examined the effect of measurement\nerrors on the association between diet and body mass index\n(BMI). First, we used the averages of two and three\nreplicate measurements of diet instead of single measure-\nment in the regression model of diet\u00b1BMI association. The\nattenuation of regression coef\u00aecients and the usefulness of\nreplicate measurements in reducing such attenuation were\ndemonstrated. Next, we used a statistical method to exam-\nine and simulate the relationship between the amount of\nmeasurement error and its effect on the regression coef\u00ae-\ncients, standard errors and con\u00aedence intervals. The impli-\ncations of measurement error in dietary data for\nepidemiologic study of diet\u00b1disease relationship were dis-\ncussed.\nMethods\nSurvey data\nlongitudinal survey covering eight provinces in China.\nDetails of the survey design and survey data were given\nAll eligible adults, 20\u00b145 y of age, were included in this\nstudy. Of the 4675 adults with complete anthropometric\nalso provided complete data in 1991. Our analysis showed\nthat the BMI, dietary intakes and other major character-\nistics of individuals who were lost to follow-up did not\ndiffer signi\u00aecantly from those who remained in the study.\nFor example, the mean BMI and fat intake at baseline of\ntively, of those who remained in the study (P b 0.1).\nWomen who were pregnant or lactating at the time of\neither survey (n  292) were excluded from analysis.\nDietary data were collected for three consecutive days.\nThe 24 h dietary recall was used to obtain data from each\nperson on each of the three days. From these data, daily\nnutrient intakes were calculated using the of\u00aecial 1991\nChinese Food Composition Table. All \u00aeeld workers\ninvolved in collecting dietary data were trained nutrition-\nists. Only individuals who had completed all three 24 h\nrecalls were included in this study.\nAnthropometric data were collected by trained health\nworkers. Weight was measured in light indoor clothing to\nthe nearest tenth of a kilogram with a beam balance scale.\nHeight was measured without shoes to the nearest tenth of a\ncentimeter with a stadiometer. From these data, the body\nmass index (BMI; weight in kg/height in m2) was calcu-\nlated.\nPhysical activity data came from the reported physical\nactivity level at occupation. These were classi\u00aeed into three\ncategories (sedentary, moderate and strenuous). Physical\nactivity was included in this analysis because it has impor-\ntant in\u00afuence on the relationship between diet and body\nweight.\nMethods\nMultiple regression analysis was used to examine the\nrelationship between diet, particularly fat intake, and the\nBMI. Dietary intake, age, gender and physical activity data\nfrom 1989 survey were used as independent variables and\nthe BMI data from 1991 survey were used as dependent\nvariable.\nSince fat intake tends to be highly correlated with total\nenergy intake, the nutrient partition method was used to\ndivide total energy intake into the energy from fat and the\nenergy from sources other than fat (Howe, 1989). These\nintakes were referred to as `fat intake' and `energy intake'\nthroughout this paper.\nMuch of the literature about measurement error is based\non the model\nXt\n xt\n ut\nY t  1Y 2Y F F F Y nY\nwhere Xt\nis the observed dietary intake, xt\nis the true long-\nterm intake and ut\nis the measurement error in the dietary\nvariable Xt\n.

We\nassumed that the dietary intakes were measured with error,\nwhile other explanatory variables (age, gender and physical\nactivity) were measured without error.\nFirstly, we used replicate measurements of diet to adjust\nthe regression coef\u00aecients for random measurement errors.\nThe averages of two and three dietary recalls were used\ninstead of single recall in the regression model of diet-BMI\nassociation. The \u00aerst, second and third dietary recalls were\nlabeled as Day 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The regression\nmodel with single recall (Day 1) was estimated. Thereafter,\nmodels with the average of two recalls (Day 1  Day 2)/2\nand the average of three recalls (Day 1  Day 2  Day 3)/3\nwere estimated. The results from these three models were\ncompared. This approach reduces the random measurement\nerrors in the model by using the average of replicate\nmeasurements of diet to approximate the true value.\nNext, we simulated the effect of measurement errors on\nthe diet\u00b1BMI association. This was done by adjusting the\nsum of squares and cross-products matrix of regression\ncoef\u00aecients for a speci\u00aeed amount of measurement error\nvariance (Fuller, 1987). From the regression model with\naverage of three recalls, we removed the hypothetical,\ngraded amounts of measurement error variance from the\ntotal variances of fat and energy intakes and we observed\nthe changes in regression coef\u00aecients. Since measurement\nerrors in fat intake is likely to be correlated with error in\nenergy intake, the corresponding amounts of fat-energy\nMeasurement error in dietary data analysis\nS Paeratakul et al\nerror covariance were also removed from the total co-\nvariance of fat and energy intakes. The standard errors of\nregression coef\u00aecients were adjusted accordingly.\nAll analyses were done with SAS version 6.08, SAS\nInteractive Matrix Language (SAS Institute, 1985 and\nResults\nindividuals. The mean (s.d.) age at baseline (1989) survey\nand 43% reported sedentary, moderate and strenuous phy-\nsical activity, respectively.\nFat and energy intakes at the 1989 survey and weight,\nheight and BMI at the 1991 survey are shown in Table 1.\nAs shown in Table 1, the standard deviations of fat and\nenergy intakes progressively decreased as the number of\nreplicate measurements increased.\nRegression model with one 24 h dietary recall and\nmodels with the averages of two and three recalls appear\nin Table 2.\nThe regression coef\u00aecients of fat and energy intakes\nprogressively increased as the number of replicate measure-\nments of diet increased. These increases were especially\nmarked when the average of two recalls were used instead\nof one recall. The regression coef\u00aecient of fat intake\nincreased by twofold, and the coef\u00aecient of energy intake\nincreased by about 40% when the average of three recalls\nwas used instead of single recall.\nUsing the regression model with average of three recalls,\nwe examined the effect of hypothetical, graded increments\nin amount of measurement error on the regression coef\u00ae-\ncients. For this, we assumed that there were different\namounts of measurement error in dietary data, ranging\nfrom 5 \u00b1 40% of the total variances and covariance of fat\nand energy intakes. The regression coef\u00aecients and stan-\ndard errors were then adjusted for the corresponding\namounts of measurement error assumed (Table 3, Figures\nThe regression coef\u00aecients and standard errors of fat and\nenergy intakes progressively increased as the increasing\namounts of measurement error were adjusted. In other\nwords, the increasing amount of error was associated with\nincreasing attenuation of diet\u00b1BMI association, which in\nturn resulted in the increasing in\u00afation (de-attenuation) of\nregression coef\u00aecients after serial adjustments. Figures 1\nand 2 show that the increases in the regression coef\u00aecients\nand their con\u00aedence intervals were not linear though the\nrange of measurement error assumed, that is, the effect of\nmeasurement errors became increasingly marked when the\nassumed amount of error variances exceeded 10 \u00b115% of\nthe total variances of fat and energy intakes.\nTable 1 Dietary intakes, weight, height and BMI of the study sample (n  3479)\nMean (s.d.)

The commonly\nused dietary assessment methods fall into two categories:\nthe frequency methods such as quantitative and semiquan-\ntitative food frequency questionnaires; and the daily con-\nsumption methods such as food record and 24 h dietary\nrecall (Liu, 1989). A well-designed frequency method may\ngive a good approximation of long-term diet. However,\nthey do not give meaningful absolute values of intake (Liu,\n1989). The daily consumption methods give meaningful\nabsolute values of intake, but they are extremely vulnerable\nto the daily (within-person) variation unless adequate\nnumber of replicate measurements are collected.\nThe following discussion applies to studies that use daily\nconsumption methods. We have shown that measurement\nerrors attenuated the diet-BMI association, and the use of\nreplicate measurements of diet can substantially reduce this\neffect. The collection of replicate measurements of diet,\nhowever, is not always possible or feasible. Studies that\ninvolve micronutrients usually require a large number of\nreplicates, and such undertaking can be complicated and\nexpensive. For macronutrients, however, a small number of\nreplicates may suf\u00aece since it has been shown that although\nthe minimum variance may be obtained from several\nreplicate measurements, two replicates provide a variance\nthat is not far from optimal in most situations (Rosner &\nWillett, 1988). Results from our study support this view.\nDay-to-day variation in dietary intake is the main source\nof measurement error in dietary data. If the replicate\nmeasurements of diet are available, there are statistical\nmethods that may be used to correct the diet-disease\nassociation for within-person error. These are the reliability\n1990). Also, the within-person variance may be used to\nadjust the regression coef\u00aecients (Fuller, 1987). All of\nthese methods are aimed at removing the within-person\nvariation from dietary data, and our separate investigation\nshowed that they produce consistent results. In theory,\nresults from these methods may be viewed as an approx-\nimation of results that would otherwise be obtained if the\nestimates of long-term diet were available.\nOur simulation showed that for a given observed asso-\nciation, an increasing amount of measurement error was\nassociated with an increasing attenuation of regression\ncoef\u00aecients. Moreover, the effect of measurement error\non the regression coef\u00aecients and con\u00aedence intervals\nmay not be linear, and may be marked when measurement\nerror variance accounts for more than 10 \u00b115% of the total\nvariance. This suggests that a true but weak diet\u00b1disease\nrelationship may be partially or completely obscured by a\nrelatively small amount of measurement error in dietary\ndata.\nMeasurement error models are based on several assump-\ntions, among them that the observed variation at a given\ntime is independent. This assumption may not hold in\nstudies that use data from food diaries or dietary recalls\nconducted on consecutive days. For example, it is possible\nthat over-eating on one day may be followed by under-\neating the next day (El Lozy, 1983). For practical reasons,\nthe China Health and Nutrition Survey used the consecutive\n24 h dietary recalls. Therefore, the possible violation of this\nassumption is a major weakness of this study. If over-eating\non one day leads to under-eating the next day, then the\nwithin-person variation is exaggerated. On the other hand,\nif the meals on one day consist mostly of left-over foods\nfrom previous day, then the within-person variance is\nunderestimated. To deal with this problem, the replicate\nmeasurements of diet must be collected at random, pre-\nferably several days apart. Such problem re\u00afects the\ndif\u00aeculty in collecting measurements of diet from large\nnumber of subjects.\nA type of measurement error that is especially relevant\nto epidemiologic study of diet and body weight is the\nsystematic within-person error caused by under-reporting\nof dietary intake by some overweight individuals (Braitman\net al, 1985) and by deliberate dieting in response to weight\ngain (Lissner & Heitmann, 1995). The effect of this error\non diet\u00b1body weight relationship can not be estimated, but\nit is likely to be signi\u00aecant in many situations. These\nbehaviors are especially common in the Western popula-\ntions where obesity is considered to be a health and social\ndisadvantage and where high-fat diet is being actively\navoided. However, we believe that the magnitude of this\nerror in our data was small. Our preliminary analysis\nshowed that individuals with high BMI (for example,\nBMI greater than 25 or 30) reported higher fat intake\nthan their counterparts, both in absolute value and as the\npercentage of total energy intake. Moreover, in China and\nin many developing countries, both obesity and high-fat\n`af\u00afuent' diet are often associated with good health and\nhigh social status (Sobal & Stunkard, 1989; The World\nHealth Organization, 1990). Therefore, healthy individuals\nwho are experiencing rapid weight gain may not perceive\nthe condition as hazardous to their health, and the over-\nweight individuals may be indifferent to further weight gain\nConclusions\nOur \u00aendings suggest that measurement error in dietary data\nmay be responsible for the weak or missing association in\nstudies where there are strong biologic evidence to support\nthe existence of diet\u00b1disease relationships. Therefore, in\nsituations where dietary intakes are subject to large day-to-\nday variation, collection of replicate measurements of diet\nand the use of a method to adjust for within-person\nvariation may be considered.\nIn designing an epidemiologic study of diet\u00b1disease\nrelationship, the investigator must therefore decide whether\nto enroll many subjects and collect few replicates per\nperson, or to enroll few subjects and collect many replicates\n(Willett, 1990). The answer is not simple, even with a\nmethod to determine the number of days necessary to\nThis decision depends on several factors, such as the\nfeasibility, cost, and the expected strength of the diet-\ndisease association.\nMeasurement error in dietary data has important impli-\ncations for the epidemiologic study of diet\u00b1disease relation-\nships. The within-person error is of particular importance in\nstudies that collect dietary data by using the daily con-\nsumption methods. Major implications include the selection\nof a suitable dietary instrument, the estimation of optimum\nnumber of replicate measurements of diet, and the calcula-\ntion of appropriate sample size. For example, if the effect\nof measurement error on diet\u00b1disease association is\nMeasurement error in dietary data analysis\nS Paeratakul et al\nignored, the sample size is likely to be miscalculated\n(Rappaport et al, 1995). Moreover, in the studies that\ninvolve nutrients with high within-person variation or\nfood items that are not consumed frequently, it may be\nappropriate to collect dietary data by using a frequency\nmethod such as food frequency questionnaires which pro-\nvides direct estimate of long-term intake. Therefore a pre-\nplanned effort to reduce measurement error before the\nactual data collection may help to reveal the diet-disease\nrelationship of interest and to reduce the number of subjects\nand/or replicate measurements required.\n"
