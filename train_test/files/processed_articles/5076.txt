    "abstract": "Abstract\nAt the start of 2016, the 10 nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) entered a new era. With it, came\nthe decade-old start of the implementation of the 2005 mutual recognition arrangement (MRA) on engineering services, and\nthe free flow of skilled labor (FFSL). Although created with noble intentions, actual specifications and qualifications for an\nindividual's foreign employment heavily restricts its actual implementation. This study, therefore, conducted a confirmatory\nfactor analysis using LISREL 9.1 software of 278 engineers selected from a population of 1,211 Thai Federation of Industries\ncompanies to investigate how need, gap, and competency affect readiness. From the analysis, need was shown to have the\nhighest effect on readiness, whereas competency also had a direct effect on readiness. Finally, the research determined\nthat less than 1% of the surveyed engineers were certified as ASEAN engineers, which is a precondition for registration for\nwork as an engineer in another ASEAN country, and that cultural awareness of other member nations was perceived as the\nweakest link in an individual's engineer readiness perception.\n",

And, whether a desired outcome\nor not, Thailand has become a \"hub\" for an estimated 6.5\nmillion, migrating intra-ASEAN foreign workers (mostly\nunskilled; International Labour Organization and the Asian\nIn this market, an International Labour Organization\n(ILO; 2014) survey of ASEAN companies indicated that less\nthan one in three surveyed agreed that secondary school\ngraduates were equipped with the relevant skills needed by\ntheir firms. Some good news, however, can be found in\nanother ASEAN ILO study, which indicated that 80% of\nthese same organizations felt it important to invest in human\nresource development (HRD).Also, 90% of these same firms\nreported that training investment is an important way to\naddress performance gaps, promote continuous development\nof the workforce, and improve productivity\nIt seems, however, that ASEAN managers feel that educa-\ntion beyond high school (tertiary education), especially\nvocational education and training systems, is better aligned\nwith industry requirements. What was interesting to also\nnote from the survey was where the greatest skill gaps were,\nwith training needed greatest in management and leadership\nDepending on which ASEAN country you choose to\nestablish your business in can also determine what skill\nshortage a foreign manager might expect. In Cambodia,\ncommunication and foreign language skills are in great\nshortage (Bruni, Luch, & Kuoch, 2013). In Vietnam, the\nWorld Bank (2014) company survey identified job-related\ntechnical skills gaps, including problem solving, critical\nthinking, teamwork, and communications. The study also\nindicated that until these shortages are relieved, firms will be\nfaced with high staff turnovers, or having to fill skilled posi-\ntions with marginally capable domestic workers, or having to\nrecruit skilled workers from other ASEAN member nations\n1King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand\nCorresponding Author:\nDuangporn Kraisuth, Faculty of Administration and Management,\nKing Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, 1 Chalongkrung Rd.,\nEmail: duangporn.kraisuth@gmail.com\nThai AEC Engineer Readiness: A\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis\nDuangporn Kraisuth1 and Vinai Panjakajornsak1\n Keywords\nASEAN, competency, FFSL, gap, MRA, need\n2 SAGE Open\nThe World Bank's (2014) Vietnam analysis of skill short-\nages and the need for foreign recruitment are already being\nconfirmed in Thailand; as in late 2016, the Thai government\npostdoctoral researchers to meet the needs of 10 targeted\nindustries under the banner \"Thailand 4.0\" (Jones & Pimdee,\n2017). This program is focused on technological develop-\nment and innovation, and in the first recruitment cycle of the\n300 scholarships being awarded to produce doctoral research-\ners, 60 scholarships (20%) are targeted for researchers from\nWith tighter integration of the AEC at the start of 2016,\nthe ability for the free flow of skilled labor (FFSL) also\nbegan (Sugiyarto & Agunias, 2014). The FFSL, combined\nwith the mutual recognition agreements (MRA), is designed\nto allow AEC member countries to share their expertise\nacross borders, \"without any legal limitations\" (Chia, 2011;\nFukunaga, 2015). This, however, seems to be at odds with\nthe reality of the \"fine print\" within the documents concern-\ning \"certification\" and \"qualifications.\"\nA year has now gone by since the beginning of a new era\nof AEC integration, and from all appearances, not much has\nchanged. This has, therefore, lead to the following state-\nments concerning the issues regarding Thai engineer readi-\nness to participate in AEC engineering projects, under the\nexisting MRA and FFSL regulations.\nProblem Statement\nThe Thai government has announced \"Thailand 4.0,\" which\nfocuses on technological development and innovation within\n10 key industrial sectors. From subsequent announcements\nconcerning the funding and recruitment of 12,290 postdoc-\ntoral researchers (domestic and foreign), indications are a\ncritical shortage of \"skilled knowledge workers\" and engi-\nneering expertise is looming. Furthermore, as Thailand looks\nto other ASEAN markets to expand its own business pres-\nence, issues concerning engineer readiness are being raised.\nTherefore, this study aimed to determine what level of readi-\nness (either perceived or real) Thai engineers have and what\nare their \"needs\" and \"gaps\" in accomplishing work outside\nThailand, within anASEAN structure. Investigation included\nengineer certification requirements, MRA agreements, lan-\nguage skills, and cultural skills.\nLiterature Review\nReadiness\nThe Korn Ferry Institute (2015) has indicated that individual\nreadiness is the crucial link between high potential and suc-\ncess in a new job (which is not the same as potential), as\nreadiness is the ability to act \"now.\" As a knock-on effect\nfrom American's space program in 1974, and in a search for\na contractor support criterion, the technology readiness level\n(TRL) metric was developed, which assessed the maturity of\nevolving technologies prior to incorporating them into a sys-\ntem or subsystem (Fedkin, 2015). This later became a stan-\ndardmetricforcommunicationofatechnology'sdevelopment\nAlthough the TRL is not a scale to directly measure an\nengineer's readiness, it does, however, require a high level of\nprofessional capability to search out the most recent informa-\ntion, from a multitude of sources, concerning the characteris-\ntics of new systems, prototypes, and competition, and being\nable to justify the resultant cost and economic viability\n(Fedkin, 2015). This is consistent with Davis, Beyerlein, and\nDavis (2006), who investigated the roles that professional\nengineers utilize in their careers, and indicated that informa-\ntion retrieval and evaluation skills are important for five of the\n10 readiness roles the study described, which included analyst,\nproblem solver, designer, researcher, and communicator.\nDenham, Zinsser, and Bailey (2011) referred to emotional\nintelligence (EQ) as emotional competence. Later, research\nby Buzdar, Ali, and Tariq (2016) examined EQ's effect on\nreadiness, and determined that positive effects on students'\nreadiness for online learning.\nThe Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence\ning EQ importance, and its contribution to organizational\nprofitability. A similar meta-analysis study by Miao,\nHumphrey, and Qian (2016) concluded that a manager's EQ\npositively relates to a subordinate's job satisfaction. This is\nconsistent with Parke, Seo, and Sherf (2015), who also con-\ncluded that a worker or manager's EQ is a key factor for\nhigher income and advancement, with Elegbe (2015) indicat-\ning that EQ was a missing priority in an engineering pro-\ngram's education curriculum.\nFrom a review of the literature and theory, four observed\nvariables were identified and added to the research frame-\nwork for readiness. These included the variables environ-\nment and emotion, motivation, and personality (EMP).\nCompetency\nAstudy on the theory of competency can begin with Flanagan's\n(1954) \"Critical Incidents Technique,\" which is thought of as\na key methodology in competency studies. McClelland later\nadopted Flanagan's work, which led to the adoption of the\nterm \"competency,\" and the separation of \"competency\" and\n\"intelligence\" (McClelland, 1973). This agrees with Gipps\nand Stobart (2003), who defined \"competent\" as one's indi-\nvidual experience and his or her related educational training,\nrather than a natural feature such as intelligence.\nThe next milestone in competency modeling occurred when\nBoyatzis (1982) introduced his book on competency modeling,\nwhich emphasized the importance of systematic analysis.\nBoyatzis also introduced the behavioral event interview (BEI),\nwhich today is part of many interview processes for the Fortune\n500, universities, and organizations such as the World Bank.\nKraisuth and Panjakajornsak 3\nMyatt (2013) voiced concerns that when organizations\nvalue technical competency more than personal competency\nand an individual's \"soft skills,\" the organization will miss\nthe real value of the individual. Knowledge, therefore, should\nbe used to inspire and create brilliance in others, and \"Alead-\ner's job is to close gaps--not create them\" (Myatt, 2013).\nMore recently, from the development of Matveev's (2016)\ncollaborative intercultural competence model (CICM), it\nwas determined that the most crucial issue facing today's\nglobal business leaders and their multicultural workforce is\nhow to relate effectively and work in an intercultural context.\nAs a component of this, Deardorff (2009) was surprised to\ndiscover the lack of second-language learning and overseas\nexperience in the competencies identified as most important.\nImplications from this suggested that language learning is\nsecondary to the basic motivational and cognitive orienta-\ntions that permit movement in and among cultures, with or\nwithout language competence.\nAsamoah, Okuada, and Hayfor (2014) discussed compe-\ntency as a tool and indicated there were three components\nincluding knowledge (informational expertise such as in\nautomotive engineering); skills, which is the ability to dem-\nonstrate one's expertise (such as in contract negotiations);\nand finally, attitude, which involves how one perceives him-\nself or herself.\nBoth Reeve (2016) also indicated the importance of com-\npetency by stating it is the key to vocational and educational\ntraining (VET). This is consistent with directives from the\nEuropean Union (2015), which state that lifelong learning\nneeds to be relevant, with high-quality knowledge, skills,\nand competences developed throughout a person's career.\nThe focus of learning should also be employability, innova-\ntion, active citizenship, and well-being.\nFrom the above theories and scholars'concepts of compe-\ntency, competency was frequently discussed in terms of three\nelements. These were knowledge, skill, and attitude, and\nwere, therefore, placed into the research framework. From\nthis, the following hypotheses concerning competency were\ndeveloped:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Competency has a direct positive\neffect on readiness.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Competency has an indirect and posi-\ntive effect on readiness through gap.\nNeed\nFrom Accreditation Board for Engineering and Techno-\nlogy's (ABET) international engineering accreditation guide\nengineering programs, the curriculum necessary for prepara-\ntion of students in an engineering profession should include, in\npart, (a) leadership, (b) professional ethics, (c) and recognition\nand the ability to engage in lifelong learning (ABET; 2015).\nAs previously discussed, both the ILO and the ADB,\nagree with this assessment (ILOADB, 2014). In addition,\nABET also indicated that responsibility must be instilled in\nstudents in both a professional and ethical way. General\nknowledge or basic knowledge is imperative as well, which\nincludes the necessary basics in the math and sciences to do\na job in a related engineering field.\nAfter graduation, the concept of \"need\" is normally asso-\nciated with the discrepancy or gap between what the company\nexpects to happen, and what happens (Rouda & Kusy, 1995).\nFor example, if the company wants to promote an engineer to\na higher position that involves working and interacting with\nforeigners from other ASEAN countries, that engineer will\nneed to improve his or her English proficiency (Joungtrakul,\n2013). This discrepancy may become a reason for a training\nor HRD need (Lim, Werner, & Desimone, 2013).\nMany motivational theories are rooted in the concept of\nneeds, with needs being stated as deficiencies or imbalances,\neither physiological or psychological, that drive or direct\nemployee behavior. Although needs are internal states of\nindividuals, they are influenced by forces in the companies\n(Lim et al., 2013). Needs drive behavior through a combina-\ntion of need activation and need satisfaction. Only activated\nneeds can be motivational, because only an activated need\ngenerates the tension the person is motivated to get rid of\n(Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2014)\nTwo well-known need-based theories of motivation are\nMaslow's (1943) need hierarchy theory, and later, Alderfer's\n(1969) existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) theory.\nAlderfer (1969) emphasized the importance of emotional\nand material well-being, the desire to satisfy interpersonal\nrelationships, and the need for continual psychological\ngrowth and development.\nFurther review of human motivation theories literature\nidentifies other popular scholars including McClelland's\n\"Need theory of motivation\" (Royle & Hall, 2012), and the\nbasic needs theory (BNT; Deci & Ryan, 2000). McClelland's\nfocuses on needs for motivation/achievement (nACH), affili-\nation (nAFF), and power (nPOW), which were indicated as\ntraits that can be learned.\nNeed theories tend to suggest that to motivate employee\nlearning, companies should identify employees' needs, fol-\nlowed by informing the employee how each training pro-\ngram relates to fulfilling his or her needs (Redmond &\nFrom the above list of need theorists, Maslow's need hier-\narchy theory is probably most recognized, which visualized\nthe theory in a hierarchy, ascending from the lowest to the\nhighest (Maslow, 1943). Lower ordered needs are experi-\nenced first, which must be satisfied before higher ordered\nneeds are perceived. Therefore, before employees can be\ntrained and developed, it is important to determine what type\nof training is necessary, and whether employees are willing\nand ready to learn.\n4 SAGE Open\nIn a discussion about \"need\" and the evaluation of it, there\nis an operational definition problem of what exactly they are\nand what it entails. It seems, at times, that \"assessment\" and\n\"analysis\" are used interchangeably, but in fact, they are two\ndifferent ideas (Kaufman & Guerra-L\u00f3pez, 2013), with\n\"assessment\" designed to identify gaps in results, whereas\n\"analysis\" seeks to understand the root causes.\nIn the United Sates, the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) has indicated that the purpose of a training needs\nassessment is to identify performance requirements, and the\nknowledge, skills, and abilities needed by personnel to\naccomplish the requirements. This helps organizations direct\ntheir resources to help with the organizational mission, its\nproductivity, and help with providing quality products and\nservices.\nFrom the above theories, need has a multitude of elements\ndepending on a wide array of conditions and circumstances.\nHowever, the researchers made their best effort to narrow the\ndiscussion to professionals and management in engineering-\nrelated disciplines. From this, the following observed vari-\nables were determined, which included ethics, collaborative\nmanagement, response management, leadership, lifelong\nlearning, and basic knowledge. From the above and other\nscholars' research, the following hypotheses concerning\nneed were developed:\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Need has a direct positive influence\non gap.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Need has a direct positive influence\non readiness.\nGap\nProfessional knowledge and skills have been thought of \"soft\nskills,\" and are frequently thought to include teamwork skills,\ncommunication skills, and leadership skills (ABET, 2014;\nShuman, Besterfield-Sacre, & McGourty, 2005). This is con-\nsistent with survey data from the National Association of\nColleges and Employers (NACE; 2015), which indicated\nthat 75% of all hiring managers seek new graduates who can\nwork as a team, whereas 80% of the same managers were\nlooking for evidence of leadership skills, which had the\ngreatest influence over hiring one candidate over another.\nOther priority skills can be seen in Figure 1.\nFrom the Australian researchers Male, Bush, and\nChapman (2010), competency deficiencies in new graduates\nwere also referred to as \"skill gaps,\" with the World Chemical\nEngineering Council (WCEC) indicating that new engineer-\ning undergraduates' management and administration skills\nhaving the highest gap levels (WCEC; 2004). Research from\nrequired for industrial competency, and of these, the four\nmost important were (a) problem solving and communica-\ntions skills, (b) ethics, (c) learning, and (d) teamwork.\nPatil, Nair, and Codner (2008) studied competency gaps\nand found that there were 23 related competency variables,\nof which 10 variables were crucial. These included (a) oral\ncommunication, (b) interpersonal skills, (c) written com-\nmunication, (d) solving problem, (e) new concept develop-\nment, (f) time management, (g) teamwork, (h) knowledge\napplication in working, (i) stress management, and (j)\nlearning new things.\nZaharin (2009) researched the perception gap between\nemployers and engineering undergraduates in Malaysia, and\nfound that there were six important competencies including\n(a) communication, (b) problem solving, (c) teamwork, (d)\nlearning, (e) knowledge application in working, and (f) eth-\nics. In Thailand, Cheerakarn (2012) also discussed required\ncompetencies in human resource staffing and identified the\nfollowing key attributes including innovation, leadership,\nflexibility, motivation, and building relationships.\nAs aforementioned, there are a variety of competency gap\nelements with management and teamwork being two strong\nconcepts, which were identified and included in the hypoth-\nesized model depicted in Figure 2 and stated in the final\nhypothesis:\nHypothesis 5 (H5): Gap has a direct and positive influ-\nence on readiness.\nHypothesized Framework\nBased on the above hypotheses and review of the literature,\nthe researchers have developed Figure 2's conceptual frame-\nwork, which includes the causal relationships between com-\npetency, gap, needs, and readiness of Thai professional\nengineers to work within the AEC.\nFigure 1.

For the study, the 1,211 companies were\ndivided into 12 industrial sectors (Table 1).\nOf the questionnaires sent and returned, 412 question-\nnaires were deemed complete and usable, of which 278\nrespondents who affirmatively answered the survey question\n\"Are you prepared to work in another ASEAN country?\"\nwere selected for further analysis.\nFurthermore, the questionnaire was divided into two\nparts, with Part 1 consisting of the respondent's general and\npersonal information, whereas Part 2 consisted of the actual\nquestionnaire concerning the engineer's perception of his or\nher readiness for work within an AEC member country. Part\n2 also consisted of 60 questions divided into four parts, with\ncompetency consisting of 12 questions, needs with 24 ques-\ntions, competency gap with 11 questions, and readiness with\n11 questions (Tables 2 and 3). Respondents' perceptions of\ntheir readiness were noted by use of a Likert-type agreement\nscale (Likert, 1932) ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7\n(strongly disagree).\nTherefore, from the seven levels of frequency (Table 3),\nthe interpretation of these responses was calculated by using\nthe following formula:\nInterval\nthehighestscore thelowestscore\nthenumber of interval\n=\n-\n.\n.\nA 0.86 (rounded) interval level for the seven levels of fre-\nquency was used and is detailed in Table 3.\nneed\nknowledge\nskill\nattitude\nmanagement teamwork\nenvironment\nemotion\nmotivation\npersonality\nethics\nleadership\ngap readiness\ncompetency\nlife-long\nlearning\nbasic knowledge\ncollaborative\nmanagement\nresponse\nmanagement\nFigure 2.

Content validity was evaluated by using item-objec-\ntive congruence (IOC) value, with the IOC value of\n0.6 or more being considered satisfactory. The index\nof IOC developed by Rovinelli and Hambleton\n(1977) is a procedure used in test development for\nevaluating content validity at the item development\nstage. Using this criterion, the content validity was\nreviewed by five researchers to determine the rele-\nvancy and validity of the questions, including the\nlatent variables.\n2. The reliability was estimated using Cronbach's alpha,\nresulting in values ranging from .7 or greater (Tavakol\nReliability\nThirty questionnaires were used in the initial reliability test\nto ensure the responses collected through the instrument\nwere consistent and reliable, which was calculated with use\nof Cronbach's alpha and was determined to be highly reliable\nthe value of Cronbach's alpha (Table 4), although some\nauthors suggest higher values of .90 to .95 should be used\nQuantitative Data Analysis\nThe study identified two exogenous latent variables,\nwhich consisted of two observed variables (Hancock &\nNevitt, 1999), including competency (knowledge, skill,\nand attitude) and need (ethics, collaborative management,\nresponse management, leadership, lifelong learning, and\nbasic knowledge).\nThe study also identified a mediator latent variable, which\nwas gap. Gap consisted of two observed or manifest vari-\nables, including management and teamwork. Mediating vari-\nables are important in psychological theory and research, and\ntransmit the effect of an independent variable on a dependent\nvariable (MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007).\nIn addition, the endogenous latent variables relating to\nreadiness consisted of environment and EMP. Readiness was\nidentified as the moderator variable of the research. From the\nliterature review and theory, Table 5 shows the exogenous,\nmediator, and the endogenous latent variables, along with\ntheir related observed variables and supporting theory.\nQualitative Data Analysis\nThe UCLA Statistical Consulting Group (2016) has sug-\ngested sample sizes typically range between five and 15\nitems per estimated parameter, with sample sizes greater than\n200 cases, but vary depending on the complexity of the spec-\nified model. Nunnally and Bernstein (1994) suggested a\nmiddle number of 10 cases per variable as being sufficient.\nTherefore, from the above and other reviewed theory, a ratio\nof 20:1 was deemed to be highly reliable. Thus, the study's\nwere deemed to be highly reliable.\nQualitative research was conducted by use of in-depth,\nsemistructured, guided interviews with five experts (three\nuniversity engineering lecturers and two engineers certified\nfrom the Council of Engineers of Thailand [COE]) to deter-\nmine the questionnaire's content validity, which covered the\nfollowing five topics. Revision was based on the comments\nand feedback from each expert.\n1. the measurement of readiness,\n2. the measurement of competency,\n3. the measurement of gap, and\n4. the measurement of need.\nResults\nRespondent's Demographic Characteristics\nTable 6 shows the results from the 278 Thai engineering pro-\nfessionals surveyed, the majority were male (85.0%) and\nmaster's degree.

Table 9 shows the results from the study,\nwhich indicate the positive relationships. In addition, the\nvariables are most correlated at the statistically significant\nlevel of p < .05. The study also considered the pairs of\nobserved variables' correlation coefficients (Table 9) where\nvalues were above .85.

From the modeling, the 2 was\n0.000, which indicates an acceptable fit with the model. This\nensures that the observed variables are sensitive to readiness\nand are suitable for further analysis.\nScholars such as Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen (2008)\nand Hair, Hult, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2016) have stated items\nwith low multiple R2 (less than .20 and .25, respectively)\nshould be removed from an analysis as this is an indication\nof very high levels of error. Goodness-of-fit statistic (GFI)\ngoodness-of-fit index (AGFI) should also have a value\ngreater than 0.90, which indicates a well-fitting model\nConvergent Model Analysis\nFrom the LISREL 9.1 analysis of the four latent variables\nand their related hypotheses, it was determined that the\nmodel had a good fit with the empirical data. Confirmation\nof this was obtained by the consistency of the following mea-\nsurements and data:\nResult details were as follows:\nof 47 degrees of freedom (df), the ratio between chi-\nsquare and the df was equal to 0.82 when tested,\nwhich showed statistical significance as it was >.05\n(p = .802), which confirms the model's hypotheses\nare not different from the empirical data.\n2. Further confirmation was established as the results of\n3. The comparative fit index (CFI) was equal to 1.000.\n5. The standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)\nwas equal to 0.023. As SRMR is an absolute measure\nof fit, a value of zero indicates a perfect fit with a\nvalue of <0.08 indicating a reasonable fit (Hu &\n(Hoelter, 1983), which is considered to the largest\nsample size in which acceptance of the hypothesis for\nthe model is correct.\nAll the above further confirm that the model was consis-\ntent with the data and had a good fit.

In SEM, CFA is usually used to access construct\nByrne (2010) indicated that factor loadings or regression\nweight estimates of latent to observed variables should\nhave values greater than 0.50, which indicates that all the\nTable 8.

Furthermore, competency was\nTable 10.

Respecified model of factorial structure.\nshown to have an indirect, but positive effect on readiness\nthrough gap (H2). Casner-Lotto and Barrington (2006) have\nindicated that competency is the ability to use knowledge,\nfacts, and data to solve workplace problems, as well as being\nable to apply math and science concepts to problem solving.\nIn the research from Rugarcia, Felder, Woods, and Stice\n(2000), concerning their vision for engineering education, it\nwas strongly suggested that the traditional classroom envi-\nronment will probably not be adequate to equip engineering\ngraduates with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they will\nneed in the coming decades, although alternative methods\n(e.g., team based and discovery learning) have good pros-\npects to do so.\nNeed also had a direct and positive influence (0.30) on\ngap (H3). This result is supported by a survey of 606 U.S.\norganizations (Barrington, Casner-Lotto, & Wright, 2006),\nfrom which seven career readiness competencies were iden-\ntified as essential (Table 14). At the top of the list was \"pro-\nfessionalism/work ethic\" with an overwhelming 97.5%,\nindicating this was a key element to readiness. In addition,\nresults were supported by NACE (2015), which indicated\nthat 80% considered leadership skills as greatest factor in\nhiring one candidate over another. NACE's (2015) study\nindicating \"teamwork\" was the most important factor (with a\nscore of 75%) also supports the research's findings and fur-\nther supports H3.\nNeed also has a direct and positive influence on readiness\nNACE's study supports the hypotheses as career manage-\nment was identified as one of the seven essential prerequi-\nsites for career readiness by the 606 survey participants with\nIn Thailand, Reeve (2016) indicated in the process for\nlifelong learning; technical and vocational education and\ntraining (TVET) must properly prepare their students to live\nand work in the 21st century. This was consistent with the\nhuman resource study by Anh (2015) in Vietnam, in which it\nwas stated that to restructure the economy, a high-quality\nworkforce is necessary that is trained with high technologies\nand/or sciences. Furthermore, as Thailand sets off on its path\ntoward Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (Iot; Thailand\n4.0 in Thailand), a digitally enabled, knowledge worker is\nstated to be a pillar to Thailand's economic future and 10 key\neconomic sectors (Jones & Pimdee, 2017).\nTable 11.

DE = direct effect; IE = indirect effect; TE = total effect.\nKraisuth and Panjakajornsak 13\nConcerning ethics, the study identified numerous times\nthe stated need for ethics training in engineering education\nsuggested doing so is not straightforward, and motivating\nstudents to take professional ethics seriously is difficult.\nAlso, ethics undergraduate curriculum has been found to be\ninadequate and ineffective in preparing students to face ethi-\ncal issues in their workplace (Colby & Sullivan, 2008;\nShuman et al., 2004). This is especially true in Asia, and was\nranked at the bottom as an engineering need by the engineers\nthemselves for this study.\nGap has a direct and positive influence on readiness (H5),\nwhich is primarily due to gap's two observed variables,\nwhich included management and teamwork that were found\nto be key factors on gap's positive and direct influence on\nreadiness. This was once again supported by the NACE\n(2015) study, in which \"teamwork/collaboration\" was identi-\nfied by 90% of the survey participants as being a key compo-\nnent of career readiness (Table 14). Malaysian managers also\nranked as highest (55.7%) the ability to function effectively\nas an individual and in a group with the capacity to be a\nleader or manager as well as an effective team member as the\nmost important aspect to graduate readiness (Zaharin, 2009).\nThis is consistent with research from the World Bank (2014),\nin which Vietnamese employers indicated that next to job-\nspecific technical skills, working well in teams, and being\nable to solve problems are considered important behavioral\nand cognitive skills for blue-collar workers.\nReadiness and its observed variables were verified by\nCheerakarn (2012), who added innovation, leadership, flex-\nibility, motivation, and building relationships as important\ncomponents. Torrente's (2014) discussion, concerning\nPhilippine transnational entrepreneurs, indicated that suc-\ncessful personality traits included the need for achievement,\nan internal locus of control, and the willingness to take risks.\nConclusion\nThis study identified some glaring inadequacies related to\nThai engineer readiness in working within other AEC mem-\nber countries on engineering projects. From the results, fol-\nlow-on study is recommended, which explores the specific\nexperience of Thai engineers, as well as their ability to meet\nthe very specific criteria established by the 2005 mutual rec-\nognition arrangement (MRA) on engineering services.\nA key item in the MRA is the section in which it states\nindividual engineers must be in charge of significant engi-\nneering work for 2 years (Fukunaga, 2015). Furthermore,\nresearch is needed to establish how much culture (and lan-\nguage) plays a role in ASEAN engineering projects, and to\nwhat level Thai engineers have the necessary language skills\nto \"manage\" foreign workers, as it is \"managers\" that the\nASEAN MRA appears to be actually written for. In addition,\nindustrial companies in Thailand need to reduce the engi-\nneers' competency gap by use of collaborative management\nand teamwork so that their competency and needs can be\nimproved.\nFigure 8.
