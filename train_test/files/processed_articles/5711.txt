This\nconstruct, defined as treating oneself with kindness and\nnonjudgmental acceptance in response to perceived chal-\nlenges and failures (Neff, 2003), shows consistent relation-\nships with a wide range of desirable psychological attributes\nevidence indicates that self-compassion is also associated\nwith several key health-related outcomes including lower\nattenuated physiological responses to stress (Arch et al.,\nbase demonstrating the benefits of self-compassion for\nhealth is outpacing research into the pathways and processes\nthat might account for this association. The limited evidence\nto date suggests that engagement with health-promoting\nbehaviors may explain why self-compassionate people\nexperience better physical health (Dunne et al., 2016), and\nthat lower levels of negative affect account for the link\nbetween self-compassion and better health behaviors\n(Sirois et al., 2015a). In light of the consistent relationships\nbetween perceived stress and physical health (Cohen\nplausible that lower perceived stress is involved in the\npathway connecting self-compassion to health behaviors\nand physical health. The purpose of this study was to test\nthis idea.\nSelf-compassion and stress\nSelf-compassion is commonly conceptualized as including\nthree key components (Neff, 2003), each of which can have\nbenefits for reducing stress. Self-kindness refers to respond-\ning to perceived inadequacy or disappointment with under-\nstanding, patience, and acceptance, rather than with harsh\nself-criticism. This response presumably defuses negative\nemotions and helps the individual to reinterpret stressful\nevents in a self-supportive way.

Appraising diffi-\ncult events from this perspective would likely reduce the\nperception of threat that contributes to stress, as well as\nreduce the barriers to seeking help when in times of need\nfulness refers to not becoming over-identified with the\nnegative feelings that can arise after failure or during strug-\ngles, but maintaining a balanced sense of awareness of\nthose feelings. This mindset can help reduce stress by mini-\nmizing rumination over the negative aspects of events.\nTogether, the components of self-compassion are posited to\nreduce stress by enhancing the self-regulation of negative\nemotions that can result from failures and unexpected\nSubstantial evidence supports the idea that self-\ncompassion can reduce perceived stress. The link between\nself-compassion and lower stress has been well documented\nbased on self-report measures (Allen and Leary, 2010;\ndesigned to increase self-compassion produce simultane-\nous decreases in perceived stress (Neff and Germer, 2013).\nStudies employing physiological measures have also sup-\nported this relationship. For example, persons with higher\nself-compassion show lower sympathetic nervous system\nactivation and reduced inflammatory response following\nexposure to a lab stressor, even after accounting for demo-\ngraphics, depressive symptoms, and distress (Breines et al.,\nbility, an index of parasympathetic influence on the heart\nwhich reflects greater ability to return to a resting state fol-\nlowing acute stress (Svendsen et al., 2016). Finally, an exper-\nimental study found that brief training in self-compassion\ndampened young women's psychobiological responses to a\nsocial evaluative threat relative to two control conditions\n(Arch et al., 2014). Specifically, women who listened to a\n10-minute recording encouraging self-compassionate atti-\ntudes once a day for 4\ndays showed reduced sympathetic\nnervous system reactivity (salivary alpha amylase), greater\nheart rate variability, and lower self-reported anxiety.\nBecause chronic activation of the physiological stress\nresponse has been shown to have a detrimental effect on\nfindings suggest that both dispositional self-compassion\nand induced state self-compassion can protect health by\nmitigating this activation.\nIn addition to having a direct influence on physical\nhealth through psychophysiological pathways (Cohen\nindirectly through its effects on health behaviors. As people\nattempt to cope with stress, they may engage in behaviors\nthat bring short-term relief, such as smoking, drinking alco-\nhol, or consuming high-calorie, highly processed foods (Ng\nThey also are likely to neglect health-promoting behaviors,\nsuch as exercise (Ng and Jeffery, 2003; Stults-Kolehmainen\nand Sinha, 2014), or careful adherence to other medical\nregimens (e.g. Bottonari et al., 2010). Similar to the direct\npathway, this indirect pathway is most detrimental to health\nwhen stress is prolonged and the behavioral responses\noccur over an extended period of time (World Health\nSelf-compassion, health behaviors, and health\nA nascent body of evidence indicates that self-compassion\nfacilitates the practice of a range of important health behav-\niors. For example, self-compassion is associated with\nhealthy eating behaviors (Adams and Leary, 2007;\nSchoenefeld and Webb, 2013), exercise behavior (Magnus\nadherence (Dowd and Jung, 2017), medical adherence\n(Brion et al., 2014; Sirois and Hirsch, forthcoming), seek-\ning medical care (Terry et al., 2013), and indices of general\nhealth-promoting behaviors (Dunne et al., 2016; Sirois\net al., 2015a). The association of self-compassion with\nhealth behaviors has been explained in terms of its links to\nself-regulation (Terry and Leary, 2011), and adaptive regu-\nlation of emotions in particular (Sirois, 2015; Sirois et al.,\n2015a). Self-compassionate people respond to the inevita-\nble failures and setbacks that can occur when trying to\nchange their health behaviors with acceptance rather than\njudgment (self-kindness) and view their mistakes as some-\nthing everyone experiences (common humanity) rather\nthan becoming immersed in negative feelings or stressing\nabout their situation (mindfulness; for example, Adams and\nLeary, 2007). Because negative affect is known to interfere\nwith self-regulation (Sirois, 2015; Wagner and Heatherton,\n2015), self-compassionate responding can help people to\nmaintain the practice of health behaviors by tempering neg-\native emotions that may arise in response to health behavior\ngoal setbacks. Evidence supporting this proposition comes\nfrom a meta-analysis that found self-compassion was con-\nsistently and positively associated with more frequent prac-\ntice of variety of health-promoting behaviors, such as\nregular exercise, healthy eating, healthy sleep behaviors,\nand stress management in 15 samples involving more than\nously, self-compassion can also reduce perceived stress,\nwhich typically has a substantial subjective distress compo-\nnentandtendstocorrelatewithnegativeaffect(Dohrenwend\nand Shrout, 1985). For this reason, this study posited that\nself-compassion would convey a similar positive effect on\nhealth behavior through reduced perceived stress.\nSelf-compassion also appears to be beneficial for physi-\ncal health. Several studies have linked self-compassion to\nHoman and Sirois 3\nmeasures of physical well-being (Hall et al., 2013), physi-\ncal symptom scores (Dunne et al., 2016), and a composite\nmeasure of physical health (Brown et al., 2016). However,\naside from one study (Dunne et al., 2016), there has been\nlittle research into the reasons why self-compassion is\nlinked to better physical health. Dunne et al. (2016) found\nthat health-promoting behaviors partly explained the asso-\nciation between self-compassion and fewer physical symp-\ntoms, but a potential limitation of this finding is that\nself-reported symptoms tend to be influenced by negative\naffect. Specifically, although negative affect is consistently\nrelated to health complaints as measured by symptom\nchecklists, it is unrelated to many other indices of health,\nsuch as frequency of illness, usage of health care, role limi-\ntations due to physical health, pathology, or overall mortal-\nity(WatsonandPennebaker,1989).Becauseself-compassion\nis consistently associated with lower levels of negative\nto use measures that assess physical health with a range of\nindicators to avoid artificially inflated estimates of the asso-\nciation between self-compassion and health.\nThis study\nThe aim of this study was to test a serial mediation model\nin which the health-beneficial effects of self-compassion\nare conveyed through reduced perceived stress and\nincreased health behaviors. A diagram of our proposed\nmodel is presented in Figure 1. We hypothesized that self-\ncompassion would be inversely associated with perceived\nstress, and positively associated with more frequent health\nbehaviors and better physical health. We further predicted\nthat perceived stress would be inversely associated with\nfrequency of health behaviors and physical health, and\nfrequency of health behaviors would show a positive\nassociation with physical health. In regard to mediation,\nwe expected that self-compassion would have significant\nindirect effects on both health behaviors and physical\nhealth through perceived stress. Of primary interest, we\nhypothesized that self-compassion would have a positive\nindirect effect on physical health through the serial path-\nway involving reduced perceived stress and increased\nhealth behaviors. Importantly, we used a well-validated\ncomposite measure of physical health, the RAND-36\n(Hays and Morales, 2001), that included not only physical\nsymptoms but also physical functioning, role limitations,\nand general health.\nIn addition, we tested an alternate model in which the\ncausal ordering of perceived stress and health behaviors\nwas reversed. Previous work has shown that reduced nega-\ntive affect mediates the relationship between self-compassion\nand health behaviors (Sirois et al., 2015a), and this finding\nformed the basis for our original serial mediation model.\nHowever, it is also plausible that health behaviors mediate\nthe relationship between self-compassion and perceived\nstress. In this conceptualization, self-compassion will show\na positive association with health behaviors, and in turn,\nhealth behaviors will show an inverse relationship with per-\nceived stress. If this model is correct, we expected that self-\ncompassion would have a significant indirect effect on\nperceived stress through health behavior. However, if this\nmodel is incorrect, we expected to see no mediating effect\nof health behavior.\nMethods\nParticipants and procedure\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional\nReview Board and all participants were treated accord-\ning to ethical guidelines established by the American\nPsychological Association.
