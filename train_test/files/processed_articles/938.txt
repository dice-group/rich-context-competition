    "abstract": "Abstract: Data from three recent surveys indicate that about 40 percent of workers with employment-\nbased health insurance are enrolled in plans that their employers self-insure. Despite the considerable\ndifferences between federal regulation of these self-insured plans and state regulation of employer\nplans purchased from an insurance company, we find striking similarities in the populations they serve,\nthe benefits they offer, and their premium costs. Implications for health policy are discussed.\nResponsibility for regulating employer-sponsored health benefit plans\nis divided between state and federal governments. Traditionally, state\ngovernments had the authority to regulate the insurance business.\nSince its passage in 1974, however, the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (ERISA) preempts state laws affecting self-insured employer\nplans. Hence, these self-insured plans are subject only to federal oversight\nby the Department of Labor. State insurance commissioners continue to\nregulate insurance companies, thereby affecting employer-sponsored plans\nthat are purchased from insurers.\nAlthough the division of responsibility is clear in theory, the states, the\nDepartment of Labor, the courts, and Congress have struggled to define it\nin practice. For example, because some avowedly self-insured employers\nshift much of their risk onto others through reinsurance and capitation\narrangements, the definition of self-insurance is an issue. Whether certain\nstate laws have enough of an effect on employee benefits to trigger the\nERISA preemption also has been a question.\nThe state and federal regulatory regimes are quite different. State govern-\nments impose reserve requirements on health insurers to minimize the risk\nof insolvency; they impose premium taxes to finance state guaranty funds to\npay the claims of insolvent plans and, in some states, to establish high-risk\npools to cover the uninsurable; and they mandate certain types of benefits\nin plans marketed in their state. Some states also regulate rating and\nGregory Acs is a senior research associate at The Urban Institute in Washington.

They deal with reporting\nrequirements, the disclosure of information to employees, and the regula-\ntory interpretation of the fiduciary responsibility of plan administrators.\nThe ERISA preemption is very controversial. Proponents argue that it\nhas permitted employers to develop innovative solutions to containing\nhealth care costs.1 They assert that employers have led the way in negotiat-\ning with provider networks, developing plan performance measures, and\ndeveloping new risk-based payment arrangements to provide financial in-\ncentives to providers to hold down costs. They believe that employers\nwould not have had the flexibility to adopt these strategies without the\nERISA preemption. They are particularly concerned that large employers,\nwhich often are the source of innovations, would be handicapped by a\nproliferation of state-specific requirements, because large employers tend to\noperate in many different states. Furthermore, ERISA proponents contend\nthat permitting states to include self-insured employers in their rating\nreforms--thereby forcing them to pool their claims costs with others--\nwould weaken employers' financial incentives to reduce costs.\nOn the other hand, opponents of ERISA view it as an obstacle to\nenacting comprehensive health care reform at the state level.2 The law\nlimits many of the health care financing and cost containment initiatives\nthat states have considered and encourages legal challenges to these initia-\ntives.3 Because self-insured plans do not have to comply with state-\nmandated benefits, ERISA prevents states from legislating a minimum\nbenefit package for all of their residents. Opponents also are concerned that\nERISA does not provide adequate consumer protection, ranging from\nmethods of dispute resolution to solvency requirements.\nDespite these strong views about the implications of the ERISA preemp-\ntion, there is little information about firms that self-insure and the differ-\nences between self-insured and fully insured health plans. What shares of\nthe market are now under federal versus state jurisdiction? What distin-\nguishes firms that self-insure from those that purchase insurance? Have the\ntwo regulatory regimes fostered two different systems of employer-sponsored\ninsurance, with different benefit provisions and different premiums?\nVirtually any reform proposal affecting the private employment-based\nhealth insurance market must deal with the issue of continuing or modify-\ning the current regulatory distinction between self-insured and purchased\nplans. For example, during the recent national health care reform debate\nthere was considerable discussion of whether or not to include multistate,\nself-insured employers in proposed health insurance purchasing alliances,\non either a mandatory or a voluntary basis. Analysts on both sides of the\ndebate were uncertain about the number of employees in self-insured plans,\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As the impetus for reform has shifted\nfrom the national to the state level, and the scope of legislative proposals\nfrom universal to incremental, the unanswered questions remain much the\nsame. This paper addresses these questions.\nMethods\nWe tabulate data from three recent surveys with information about\nself-insured plans: the 1991 Health Insurance Association of America\n(HIAA) survey, the 1993 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Em-\nployer Health Insurance Survey, and the 1987 National Medical Expendi-\nture Survey (NMES). The first two sources are surveys of employers, while\nthe third is a survey of households.\nThe HIAA survey contains the responses of 3,323 firms nationwide that\nresponded to a telephone interview; the survey response rate was 71 per-\ncent.4 The RWJF survey, part of the foundation's State Initiatives in Health\nCare Reform program, permits state-specific estimates for ten states.5 Tele-\nphone interviews with approximately 2,000 establishments--about three-\nfourths with fifty or fewer employees--were completed in each state, for a\nBoth employer surveys collected data about the number and charac-\nteristics of the persons employed by the business and about the insurance\nplans offered. The survey respondent was asked to report whether each plan\nwas self-insured or fully insured.7 We use these data to make estimates of the\nnumber and characteristics of employees in businesses that offered a self-\ninsured plan. We refer to these as \"self-insured employers,\" although many\nof them also offered a fully insured plan. We also use the employer surveys\nto estimate the share of employees enrolled in self-insured and fully insured\nplans, and to compare the benefits and premiums for workers in self-insured\nplans with those in fully insured plans.8\nFor information about the characteristics of employees who actually\nenroll in self-insured or fully insured plans, we use NMES, sponsored by the\nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research in the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services. Approximately 15,000 households were inter-\nviewed about every four months to collect information about their health\ninsurance during 1987. NMES contacted employers, unions, and insurance\ncompanies that provided insurance for household members to verify enroll-\nment, determine premiums and payment sources, and obtain information\nabout the plan, including whether or not it was self-insured. We base our\nestimates on 6,489 policyholders in the household and follow-up surveys.9\nAmong the households completing all rounds of household interviewing,\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We exclude self-employed persons\nwith no employees.10 The NMES data include all public employers; the\nHIAA survey includes only state and local government employers; and\npublic employers are excluded from the RWJF tabulations reported here.\nThe RWJF and NMES data include union-sponsored plans, but they are not\nincluded in the HIAA data.\nResults\nPrevalence of self-insurance. The three surveys indicate that 32-42\npercent of workers who enroll for employer-sponsored health benefits are in\na self-insured plan (Exhibit l).11 This rate varies greatly with firm size.\nFewer than one in six insured employees in smaller firms (100 employees or\nfewer) are enrolled in a self-insured plan, whereas about 60 percent of\ninsured workers in the largest firms are in a self-insured plan. While the\nmajority of insured workers in large firms are in self-insured plans, even in\nlarge firms a substantial share of insured workers are in fully insured plans.\nMoreover, most workers in self-insured plans are in a plan whose risk has\nbeen limited by the employer through a reinsurance arrangement.\nThe concentration of self-insured plans in large firms also is evident from\nthe distribution of enrollees in self-insured plans by size of firm (Exhibit 2).\nThe surveys indicate that 60-75 percent of employees in self-insured plans\nare in firms with more than 500 employees.

The two national surveys show regional variation.\nThere are more workers in self-insured plans in the Midwest and South\nthan in the Northeast and West (Exhibit 3). However, looking at the\nstate-specific results from the RWJF survey, we find that differences be-\ntween states within a region are as large as or larger than differences across\nregions. Others have shown that interstate differences in insurance regula-\ntion were a factor leading firms to self-insure in the early and mid-1980s.12\nChoice among plans. Many workers in firms with a self-insured plan\n(\"self-insured businesses\" in Exhibit 4) can choose among multiple plans\noffered. Between 50 and 65 percent work for employers with more than one\nhealth insurance option. Because self-insurance and choice are both com-\nmon among large employers, those who work for self-insured employers\nhave more health plan choices than those who work for employers with\nonly fully insured plans. However, when we look at large employers only, we\nsee similar proportions of employees in firms with self-insured plans and\nwith only fully insured plans who are offered multiple options.\nForty percent of workers in self-insured firms also are offered a fully\ninsured plan. The most common option is a health maintenance organiza-\ntion (HMO). About 30 percent of workers in firms that offer a self-insured\nplan have a choice between it and an HMO, and about 9 percent are\noffered both an HMO and a fully insured indemnity or preferred provider\norganization (PPO) plan in addition to the self-insured plan.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Next, we consider whether there are differences\nbetween workers in self-insured businesses or plans and those in fully\ninsured businesses or plans. From the two employer surveys (RWJF and\nHIAA), we compare characteristics of all workers in businesses offering a\nself-insured plan with those of workers in fully insured businesses, whether\nor not the workers enroll in a plan. This comparison provides information\nabout differences in the workforces of employers that make different deci-\nsions about self-insuring. From NMES, we compare the workers who enroll\nin a self-insured plan with workers who enroll in a fully insured plan. This\ncomparison provides information about differences in the populations\nserved by self-insured and fully insured plans.\nExhibit 5 shows few differences between employees in businesses that do\nand do not offer a self-insured plan and between enrollees in self-insured\nplans and fully insured plans. All three surveys indicate that employees in\nself-insured businesses or in self-insured plans have higher earnings, but\nthese differences are small. Differences in other demographic characteristics\nare also slight and do not show a consistent pattern across the surveys.13\nEmployees who work for businesses that offer a self-insured plan are more\nlikely than those in other businesses are to be union members; hence,\nemployees in self-insured plans are more likely to be union members. This\noccurs because large firms are more likely to offer a self-insured plan and\nmore likely to have union workers.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

There is considerable variation in this proportion among\nstates, with federal regulation governing more than half of the market in\nsome states. There is also variation by firm size. About 85 percent of insured\nworkers in firms with fewer than 100 employees are in plans under state\njurisdiction, whereas states regulate plans covering only about 40 percent of\ninsured workers in firms with more than 500 employees.\nDespite the marked contrast between the state and federal regulatory\nregimes, we find a great deal of similarity between self-insured and fully\ninsured plans. They serve similar populations, offer similar benefits, and\nhave similar premium costs.\nSeveral factors may account for these similarities.

It does not have to self-insure to\navoid pooling claims with firms whose workers have less favorable demo-\ngraphics that might raise premiums.\nThe similarities in benefit design may suggest that employers' choices\nwith respect to plan design are constrained by the preferences of employees,\nregardless of whether or not the plan is self-insured. Our analysis shows that\nemployees in fully insured and self-insured plans are similar in many char-\nacteristics that are related to the demand for insurance; hence, one would\nexpect the plan benefits to be similar as well. The broad coverage standards\nset by the HMO Act of 1973 for federally qualified HMOs may serve to\nconstrain the range of options as well, if consumers or employers view them\nas a federal statement of the minimum necessary coverage.\nThe similarities between the different types of plans may also indicate\nthat fully insured and self-insured plans continue to compete with each\nother to a significant extent, despite playing under different rules. As noted\nabove, a sizable share of policies in large firms--which are in the best\nposition to self-insure--remain fully insured.\nSome critics of the dual regulatory regime express concern about the lack\nof solvency standards for plans under federal regulation. Our results suggest\nthat workers in self-insured plans may not be at greater risk than workers in\nfully insured plans, at least with respect to financing the uncommon event\nof one or more extremely high cost cases. Most self-insured plans include a\nreinsurance mechanism. In addition, most self-insured plans are sponsored\nby large employers and therefore enjoy the benefit of pooling risks over\nmany covered lives. Our data, however, do not permit us to address a second\ndimension of solvency--the adequacy of reserves.\nThe similarities among the self-insured and fully insured plans have a\nnumber of implications for state and national health policy. First, the\nsimilarity in benefits indicates that past state policies related to mandated\nbenefits have not driven firms to self-insure in order to escape the cost of\nproviding these benefits. Similarly, Gail Jensen and colleagues found that\nalthough state mandates may have been a factor leading to the decision to\nself-insure in the early 1980s, they have not been a major factor encourag-\ning self-insurance in more recent years.16 Moreover, the trend to self-\nfunding among large firms may have leveled off in recent years as these\nemployers have turned to managed care plans--still primarily purchased--\nto contain costs.\nSecond, there are few differences in premiums and demographic charac-\nteristics, suggesting that self-insured plans do not enroll a more favorable\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

There do not appear to be major differences between the two types of\nplans that would justify special treatment for one or the other.\nFinally, our findings suggest that ERISA may not present significant\nobstacles to effective implementation of many of the current state initia-\ntives that focus on insurance rating, underwriting, and purchasing reforms\nfor small businesses. Although ERISA has led to a division in the employer-\nsponsored insurance market between plans governed by state regulation\nand those operated under federal rules, our data show that this division is\nlargely related to firm size. Most policies offered by small businesses are fully\ninsured and, therefore, are under the purview of state regulators. Although\nthis suggests that state efforts to reform the small-group market are not\nlimited at present, the picture could change if small businesses claim to\nself-fund by buying low-deductible reinsurance.\nThis research was supported by separate awards from the Pension and Welfare Benefits Admini-\nstration of the US.

The unit interviewed was the establishment; however,\nhere we classify employers and workers by the size of the firm, not the establishment,\nfor comparison with the HIAA and NMES results.\n7. The respondent's report was used to classify plans as self-insured or fully insured.\nReinsurance and its extent was not taken into account. For example, a reinsurance\npolicy that pays when claims exceed $1,000 may be called \"self-insured with reinsur-\nance\" by a business that seeks exemption from state regulation under ERISA, while\nstate regulators would view the reinsurance policy as primary coverage.\n8. The HIAA survey limited questions about plan characteristics to the largest plan\noffered among four different types (conventional, HMO, PPO, and point-of-service).\nThus, if the self-insured plan was not the largest of its type, we might undercount the\nnumber of employees in self-insured firms. On the other hand, we may overstate\nenrollment in other firms. We attribute all of the enrollment for a particular type of\nplan to the largest plan of that type. Thus, enrollment in a self-insured plan would be\noverstated if the employer offered a smaller but fully insured plan of the same type.\n9. C. Emmons and C.

Dependents and retirees account for a somewhat higher proportion of the total\nenrollment in self-insured plans than in fully insured plans, based on NMES tabulations\nnot shown here.

The similarity of demographic characteristics extends to all enrollees--active workers,\ndependents, and former workers--based on NMES tabulations not shown here.\n14. Deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for employees in self-insured plans are lower\nthan those for workers in fully insured indemnity and PPO plans. Those in self-insured\nplans are more likely to have coverage for special services such as prescription drugs\nand dental care. Our survey data do not reveal differences in administrative practices\nthat deny coverage under special circumstances. In cases of dispute, consumers have\nrecourse to state insurance regulatory processes when covered by a fully insured plan,\nbut there is no corresponding relief under self-insured plans.\n15. \"Premiums\" for self-insured plans are difficult to measure because there is not an\nobserved transaction between the employer and the insurer. Surveys use different\napproaches to measure these premiums. The RWJF survey asked respondents to report\na premium equivalent. The premium equivalent includes administrative costs. The\nadministrative cost is imputed for self-insured plans that report a premium equivalent\nthat reflects only claims payment. The HIAA premiums for self-insured plans are based\non the subset of plans for which employers regularly put aside monthly allotments.\nAdministrative costs are included if they are part of this allotment. The NMES\npremiums were imputed from the total funding (including administrative costs) of\nself-insured plans that provided this information.\n16.
