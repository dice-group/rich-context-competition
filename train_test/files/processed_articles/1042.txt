Age\n(5-year categories from 65 to >95)-specific rates were calculated\nfor the 1982 NLTCS and applied to United States Census Bureau\nestimates of the 1994 population to calculate chronic disability\nprevalence rates adjusted for aging in the United States popu-\nlation aged >65. The 1982 age standardized rates were compared\nwith 1994 NLTCS estimates.

When it was\nrecognized in 1982 that United States chronic disease mor-\ntality rates above age 65 had been declining since at least 1968,\nwith the consequence that the United States elderly popula-\ntion was growing faster than projected by the Social Security\nAdministration (3, 4), the question was raised of whether\nchronic disease and disability rates had changed in a parallel\nfashion. If they had, one might expect the period of life\nafflicted with chronic morbidity and disability to remain\nrelatively constant--or decline (5, 6). On the other hand, if\nchronic morbidity and disability incidence remained un-\nchanged, with life expectancy increases above 65 largely due to\nimproved medical treatments, then the period of life spent\ndisabled might have increased (7). In this latter case, raising\nthe normal retirement age for Social Security might not be a\nfeasible solution to the problem. These questions played a\nmajor role in the debate about the changes in Social Security\nlegislation finally passed in 1983. Because of a lack of clear\nevidence as to which scenario dominated health changes from\nin the future, a mixed strategy of a small increase in the normal\n2027) and increased payroll taxes was adopted. These policy\noptions have to be revisited before large numbers of post-\nWorld War II baby boom cohorts pass the ages of 65 to 67\nSecond, chronic disability, especially for elderly populations,\nis a sensitive measure of age-related changes in the health and\nbiological fitness of individuals. It is a crucial question about\nthe age rate of physiological changes, of whether recent\nincreases in United States life expectancy at ages 65, and\napparent changes in the manifest lifespan [i.e., the highest age\nto which individuals in a population are observed to live (8, 9)]\nare associated with not only reductions of chronic disease\nprevalence, but also increases in the average level of physical\nfunctioning at specific late ages. In this sense, disability is a\nmarker of whether life expectancy increases are associated\nwith changes in the age rate of loss of the average biological\nfitness of a population--a marker that could be interpreted as\nmeasuring changes in the biological rate of aging (10). This\nmeasure would be useful to help assess whether changes in the\nbiological rate of aging, as inferred from models of the force\nof mortality [e.g., changes in the shape parameter of the\nGompertz hazard function (11, 12); in some cases changes in\nthe shape parameter is conditional on risk factor dynamics\n(13)], correlate with changes in the biological fitness of the\nUnited States elderly population as reflected in age-specific\ndisability rates calculated from longitudinal survey data.\nThe arguments for using disability measures to make these\nassessments are substantive and methodological. Substantively,\nthe dimensions of chronic disability are not only a product of\nchronic morbidity but are, increasingly, at advanced ages, primary\nrisk factors for diseases such as stroke (14), coronary heart\ndisease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (15\u00ad18).\nSpecifically, in middle age, disability is often viewed as a product\nof the age-related progression of the severity of specific chronic\ndisease processes. At late ages (e.g., starting at 65) chronic\ndisability will increasingly be a result of (i) the interaction of\nmultiple disease processes (rather than the product of a single\ndisease process) andor (ii) the product of more general losses of\nphysiological functions due to global processes of senescence (19).\nFor example, declines in immune function with age increase the\nrisk of pulmonary viral and bacterial infections leading to pneu-\nmonia. Decreased physical activity will lead to deconditioning of\ncardiopulmonary function, general vascular tone, and the fitness\nof voluntary muscles that may impair the efficiency of peripheral\nThe publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge\npayment.

Thus, reductions in chronic disability at late ages may\nhave important direct and indirect effects on the future rate of\ngrowth of United States health care expenditures.\nMethodologically, longitudinal measurements of chronic dis-\nability are important because they are easier to assess in nationally\nrepresentative population surveys than many physiological risk\nfactors or biomarkers of aging, which require blood drawing or\nother physically invasive (and expensive) tests and procedures (25,\n26). The information content of longitudinal population moni-\ntoring can be greatly enhanced by linking an individual's survey\ndata to hisher continuous records of Medicare Part A and B\nservice use. They also provide a temporal matrix for integrating\ndata from specialized health studies--an integration that in-\ncreases the value of that specialized health information by helping\nto assess, and possibly enhance, its population and temporal\nThough chronic disability time series are important to\nmonitor age-specific changes in population health and biolog-\nical fitness, measurement of chronic disability, especially in\nelderly populations, is complicated by the different types and\ndegrees of disability manifest (13). There is no universal ``gold\nstandard'' for measuring disability (30, 31). Measurement is\nless difficult for severe disability, where physical manifesta-\ntions are readily observed and evaluated. Despite these meth-\nodological issues, measurements of disability are surprisingly\nrobust, with national estimates of the prevalence of chronic,\nsevere disability in the elderly shown to agree across several\nnational surveys, even with differences in questionnaire word-\ning, in a large federal interagency study (32). If assessed with\nthe same instrument over time, and using similarly structured\nand coordinated samples, the likelihood of bias in estimates of\nprevalence change would be further reduced.\nIn this study, the prevalence of chronic disability and\ninstitutionalization in the elderly Unites States population was\nCare Surveys (NLTCS). Disability prevalence rates for 1982\nwere standardized to the July 1, 1994 Unites States population\nage distribution (33). The 1982 standardized rates were then\ncompared with the 1994 observed rates to ascertain the size\nUnited States elderly population. This extends prior studies of\nthe NLTCS, which documented significant declines in chronic\nDATA\nThe data analyzed are individual reports of chronic (lasting, or\nexpected to last, 90 days) impairments in activities of daily living\n(36) (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (37) (IADL),\neach survey the same disability and medical condition questions\nwere asked using identical field procedures and by the same\nsurvey organization (United States Census Bureau). This mini-\nmizes bias in disability trend estimates by holding constant\ninstrument and field procedure, and related measurement arti-\nfact. The likelihood of bias is also reduced by the high (95%)\nresponse rates in all four NLTCS.\nThe samples for both NLTCS examined are large (i.e., 20,485\nprecision the traits of the oldest\u00adold population aged 85, a\nsubgroup with high chronic disability prevalence rates, in each\nbetween each pair of surveys were drawn from Medicare files in\naged 65, in each year.

Persons who receive a\ndetailed interview in one survey year are automatically inter-\nviewed in all subsequent surveys until death. Because persons are\nfollowed through the Medicare record system, nearly 100% of\ncases can be longitudinally tracked so declines, as well as in-\ncreases, in disability in previously disabled individuals can be\nidentified, as well as exact dates of death.\nCensus Bureau cross-sectional sample weights were used. In\n1989, the definition of institutional residence was expanded by\nthe Census Bureau so that estimates of change in the institu-\ntional population may be conservative.\nMETHODS\nAge (by 5-year categories from 65 to 95)-specific rates were\ncalculated for persons with chronic disabilities, or who were\ndefined as the inability to perform 1 IADL (e.g., cooking, doing\nlaundry) due to health or aging, or the inability to perform at least\none ADL (e.g., bathing, dressing) without using personal assis-\ntance or special equipment. Because institutional residents report\nan average of 4.8 ADLs impaired, they were used to define a\nseparate high disability group. To be identified as chronically\ndisabled when initially selected for a detailed interview a sample\nperson had to have at least one ADL or IADL disability that had\nlasted, or was expected to last, 90 days. Disability was grouped\ninto five categories, i.e., those with 1 IADL impaired (but no\nADL impaired), those with 1\u00ad2, 3\u00ad4, or 5\u00ad6 ADLs impaired, or\npersons residing in institutions reporting disability. All other\npersons were defined as not disabled.\nAge-specific disability prevalences from the 1982 NLTCS were\napplied to Census Bureau age-specific population estimates for\ncalculated from respondent counts. Changes in proportions were\nassessed using a test of differences in binomial probabilities.\nRESULTS\nIn Table 1 we present the observed distribution of chronic\ndisability in 1994 and the distribution of chronic disability that\nchanged.\nThe proportion of the United States population aged 65 that\nwould have been chronically disabled or institutionalized in 1994,\nproportion observed to be chronically disabled in 1994 was\nThe United States chronically disabled elderly population in\nTable 1.

Significant declines were\nobserved to the oldest ages examined, e.g., the decline between\ndeclines in chronic disability were widespread, being found in\nmost age and disability level specific subgroups.\nDISCUSSION\nThe NLTCS data show declines in disability prevalence, ob-\nprevalence decline over the 5 years would have been 1.36%--\ncompared with the 1.7% observed.

This is\nconsistent with declines in United States mortality observed at\nages of 80 (38), and with the proposition that higher United\nStates expenditures on LTC better meet the needs of the very\nelderly than the lower LTC expenditures, and less complete\nLTC service availability, in Japan (39, 40).\nIt is useful to examine what the prevalence rate changes from\nat specific dates. This is shown in Fig. 1.\nnumber disabled grew 9.4% to 7.0 million persons--as opposed\nnumber of persons age 65, and 2.7% due to the aging of the 65\npopulation). By 1994 the number chronically disabled had grown\nUnited States elderly population and 4.4% to the aging of that\nThere would then be 7.3 million disabled persons in 1996 (an\nincrease of 14.1%) compared with 8.7 million persons (an in-\nand 6.0% due to its aging) if the 1982 rates had not changed--a\ndifference of 1.4 million persons.\ndue to changes in nonstandardized rates (i.e., the observed\nnonstandardized rate changes (i.e., from 23.7 to 22.6%) from\nstandardization used to adjust for aging of the United States\nelderly population. The sensitivity of the change estimate to the\nuse of different standard populations was examined. Though the\nprevalence rates changed moderately when different standard\npopulations (e.g., different intercensal estimates) were used, since\n1994 population distribution, the change estimate is robust to the\nselection of a standard population.\nIn addition to a decline in the number of persons with chronic\ndisability there was also a small decline (2.0%) in the average\nnumber of ADLs reported by persons who were ADL-disabled in\nboth years. This reduction of 395,648 ADL impairments reported\nby the disabled population suggests that the population burden of\ndisability was further reduced by an equivalent of 111,765 dis-\nabled persons--each with an average of 3.54 ADLs.\nTable 2.

Education has been\nnegatively related to the age-specific likelihood of being chron-\nically disabled (24). The proportion of the population aged 85 to\n89, with 0\u00ad7 years of education, has been estimated to decline\n(41). It may be that this relation was due to only a select portion\nof the population receiving high levels of education in the past. As\nhigh levels of education become more prevalent, unless there is\na causal relation, the ability of education to predict disability\nmight be attenuated. Though such selection is a possible expla-\nnation, it would have to operate even though most schooling is\ndone early in life (i.e., by age 30), whereas we are examining\ndisability changes at ages 65. Because education is largely\ncompleted by age 30 this raises the question of what intermediate\nhealth care and biological mechanisms may be reducing the\nprobability of disability for better educated persons. There are\nmany candidate factors, i.e., better educated persons tend to more\nreadily adopt healthy behaviors (e.g., maintaining physical activ-\nity at late ages, reducing risk factor exposures such as smoking,\nimproving nutrition). Better educated persons are also more\nlikely to have had better medical care both early in life and in\nmiddle age, up to age 65, when qualifying for Medicare--in part\nbecause of higher rates of health insurance coverage up to age 65\nfor better educated persons (42). Better educated persons are also\nbetter equipped to comply with complex and long-term medical\ntreatments--especially for chronic conditions engendering co-\nmorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes. They are also more\nlikely to exhibit fewer disabilities even with a chronic condition\npresent (43, 44). Finally, there is evidence suggesting education is\nnegatively associated with the incidence of Alzheimer's dis-\nease--a prevalent and highly disabling condition (45).\nAn analysis of changes in disability levels by cohort (cohort\neffects were correlated with education) suggests that the age\nrate of disability increase (and, inferentially, of the biological\nrate of aging) is slower in younger, than older, cohorts. Since\nfactors related to cohort membership are, by definition, per-\nsistent, this suggests that period differences in chronic disabil-\nity are likely to continue past 1994, because those cohorts\nsucceed one another at late ages where the general level of\nAnalysis of changes in 16 chronic diseases show that there were\nlarge declines in the prevalence of those conditions from 1982 to\n1989 (35).

Waidmann et al.\n(54) attempted to resolve those difficulties by using a variety\nof survey and epidemiological data sets and making adjust-\nments for known methodological problems. They found that\nnot only did United States disability decline in the 1980s, but\nthat apparent increases in disability in the 1970s were likely due\nto measurement difficulties with National Center for Health\nStatistics surveys done in that period (54\u00ad57). Administrative\ndata also suggest that declines in institutional residence ob-\nserved in the NLTCS are consistent with declines in Medicaid\nreimbursed nursing home use by the elderly (49), the tendency\ntoward shorter nursing home stays with more medically inten-\nsive care, and the increased use in the United States of home\nhealth services for LTC (58).\nVery long-term changes in chronic disease prevalence are less\nlikely due to medical innovation than to changes in nutrition and\npublic hygiene. A number of long-term trends in these factors\npossibly contributed to declines in chronic disease and disability.\nOne factor is improvement in public hygiene and sanitation. A\nFIG. 1. Number of chronically disabled Americans aged 65 and over (in millions).\nrecently discovered pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, may explain\nlong-term declines in gastric cancer (since the 1930s) and changes\nin peptic ulcer prevalence (59). Improvements in water quality\nmay have reduced exposure to this pathogen. A second factor\npossibly contributing to long-term declines in stroke and gastric\ncancer is the reduced use of salt as a food preservative as\nrefrigeration became more widely used (60). Indeed, salt con-\nsumption and H. pylori infection may interact to increase disease\nrisk, as may salt and increased nitrate consumption. A third factor\nis better regulation of commercial food processing and livestock\nmanagement. Commercial food processing, especially thermal\nprocessing of meats, may have reduced the prevalence of food-\nborne pathogens possibly contributing to atherosclerosis (61).\nFood processing expanded rapidly after 1950. Regulation of\nlivestock feeding and handling may also have reduced food-borne\nviral pathogens. Fourth, food supplementation was initiated after\nthe discovery in 1917 of the relation of cod liver oil consumption\nto rickets. Vitamin D supplementation, either by fish oil con-\nsumption or the UV radiation of milk, was widely spread by 1924\nin the United States. British studies suggest that nutritional\ndeficiencies in pregnancy may affect fetal development in ways to\nincrease the risk of chronic disease in late adult life. Finally, a\nnumber of lifestyle factors could have contributed to changes.\nUnited States surgeon general reports in the early 1960s may have\nreduced smoking rates in successive birth cohorts (62).\nThe impact of medical therapy on disability prevalence is hard\nto assess because many treatment innovations for chronic diseases\nare recent [e.g., ACE-II inhibitors to control hypertension (63,\n64)]. There are also relatively old medical interventions whose full\nrange of effects on chronic disease and disability are just begin-\nning to be understood. Exogenous estrogens were used in 1985 by\n3 million United States women to treat postmenopausal symp-\ntaking estrogens, which may have benefit for such highly preva-\nlent, disabling conditions as osteoporosis and cardiovascular\ndisease (65\u00ad67). A recent study suggested that exogenous estro-\ngens might delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease by 5\u00ad8 years--\nand possibly reduce the prevalence of that highly disabling\ncondition in females by 50%. Aspirin may reduce the risk of\ncolorectal cancer and recurrences of stroke and heart disease.\nRecent data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs\nmay also reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease--possibly by\n25\u00ad40%. The effects of aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin-\nflammatory drugs, because of their widespread use, could affect\nthe health of a large proportion of the United States elderly\npopulation. These older interventions may combine with numer-\nous more recent medical advances to cause both chronic disease\nand disability to continue to decline for a long time--with the\nimplication of exogenously altering basic biological parameters\nreflecting age changes.\nDisability declines of the size in Fig. 1 may have important\nimplications for national health care costs. For example, the\n1994 United States institutional population was estimated to\nbe 1.7 million persons. The 1982 rates, after age standardiza-\ntion, implied 2.1 million persons would be institutionalized in\nnot include additional potential savings for acute care expen-\nditures (22). Specifically, if age increase in the prevalence of\nchronic disability is a marker of the rate of loss of biological\nfunction, then decreases in the number of chronically disabled\npersons implies that persons in ``predisabled'' states are also\nlosing biological function at a slower rate. Thus, declines in the\nnumber of disabled persons at late ages may imply better\nfunction and lower health care needs in a large proportion of\nthe younger portion of the United States elderly population. If\nmany acute care medical expenditures are due to chronic\ndisability (22), then the decline in the prevalence of disability\npopulation to grow more slowly than the total elderly popu-\nlation, could portend slower rates of growth in national health\nexpenditures in the future. A number of factors could affect\nthis. The interpretation above assumed that the length of time\na person remains disabled is relatively constant. In contrast,\nprevalence could decline if the same number of persons were\ndisabled for shorter periods of time. This might seem reason-\nable in the context of declining life expectancy, i.e., that\npersons live a shorter period of time after a potentially\ndisabling chronic disease became manifest. However, United\nStates life expectancy has increased at later ages. If the\nprevalence decline were due to shorter disability episodes\namong the same number of persons this would require, in the\ncontext of increasing late age life expectancy, the proportion\nof the lifespan spent in nondisabled states to increase. That is,\nconstraining the standard epidemiologic relation of prevalence\nto the incidence and duration of a chronic health event is an\nincreasing late age life expectancy.\nA change in the relation of disability duration and incidence\ncould also have important effects on costs by changing the mix of\nmedical services required. For example, institutional and infor-\nmal care use would increase if the duration of disability increased.\nIf duration of disability decreased, as health events increased in\nincidence, this might shift costs to hospital use and other types of\nacute health services.\nUnderstanding the effects of chronic disability changes on the\nlevel and mix of health service expenditures is important in that\ncurrently there is great concern for the fiscal stability of Medicare.\nBeginning in 2001, the Medicare Trust Fund is projected to go\ninto negative balance (69). Concerns about Medicare expendi-\ntures will increase until at least 2028 when the largest post-World\nWar II baby boom cohorts pass age 65.\nUnless gross domestic product grows faster than projected, the\nprojected increases in the size of the elderly population relative\nto the labor force (and taxable payroll base) could require large\nchanges in the Medicare program to maintain fiscal balance.\nHowever, projections of Medicare expenditures are based on the\nprojected growth of the United States elderly population--with\nno assumptions made about how health changes before death in\nthe calculations--even though life expectancy is projected to\ncontinue to increase at late ages. Thus, if declines in chronic\ndisability continue, the magnitude of changes required in the\nMedicare (and Medicaid) benefits might be reduced because of\ntwo factors. One is the change in the ratio of the size of the United\nStates population aged say, 18\u00ad64, to the population aged 65,\nwho are chronically disabled. This differs from the standard\ndependency ratio of the 18\u00ad64 to 65 populations in that it would\nreflect changes in the aggregate health of the over 65 popula-\ntion--changes that could have large effects on Medicare and\nother health expenditures. For example, Medicare Part A and B\nexpenditures are higher for chronically disabled persons. This is\ndue to a variety of factors, e.g., persons with severe chronic\ndisability are likely affected by medical conditions requiring\nconsiderable acute care. To maintain the health of a chronically\ndisabled person, one thus has to provide large amounts of medical\nservice to deal with morbidity engendered by the physiological\neffects of disability.\nTo keep a constant ratio between the United States popu-\ndisabled persons over 65, the disability prevalence rate above\nage 65 would have to be reduced 1.5% each year for 34 years,\nper year, so a 1.5% rate of decline in the disability prevalence\nrate is conceivable. However, it is important to recognize that\nrelative to the population aged 18\u00ad64 declines. Hence, to\nmaintain a constant ratio in 2050, the per annum rate of\ndecline in the prevalence of disability above age 65 required is\nlower--roughly 1.2%, the same rate of decline observed from\nover these longer periods, any sizeable decline will reduce the\nmagnitude of Medicare and Medicaid program changes\nneeded and possibly smooth out the demands induced at the\ntimes of the peak Medicare burden.\nA second factor determining how rapidly Medicare's burden\nwill grow is that the per capita annual rate of Medicare's\nexpenditures declines with increasing age at death (68). This is\nbecause a large proportion of Medicare costs, at any age, are\nmade in the 2 years immediately before death. The per capita\ndeaths). This age trajectory of expenditures, combined with the\napparent slowing of biological age changes over time, may have\nimportant consequences for the future burden of the Medicare\nprogram. These were not factored into projections of Mediacre\nIn summary, declines in the prevalence of chronic disability,\nobserved up to age 95, suggest that there have been statistically\nsignificant and biologically important changes in the age rate\nof loss of biological fitness in the United States population\nassociated with increases in life expectancy above age 65. It will\nbe important to monitor these changes in chronic disability to\ndetermine how the age rates of loss of biological fitness will\nbehave in the future. These changes may have important\nimplications in forecasting the future trajectory of changes in\nhealth expenditures in the United States elderly population.\nThis research was supported by the National Institute on Aging.\n1.
