Maziarka\n INTRODUCTION\nA recent U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) guide has pro-\nposed to align scientific research about the risk of human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission with best practices\non when states should use HIV-specific laws to seek criminal\ncharges and penalty enhancements.1 In particular, the DoJ\nreport says that ``states may wish to retain criminal liability\nwhen a person who knows he/she is HIV-positive commits a\n(non-HIV specific) sex crime where there is a risk of trans-\nmission (e.g., rape or other sexual assault)'' or when ``the\nindividual knows he/she is HIV positive and the evidence\nclearly demonstrates that individual's intent was to transmit\nthe virus and that the behavior engaged in had a significant risk\nof transmission, whether or not transmission actually\noccurred,'' (p. 4).1 Beyond these 2 circumstances, the best\npractices guide recommends that states reform and modernize\nlaws to accurately reflect the underlying low risk of HIV\ntransmission from biting, spitting, throwing body fluids, inser-\ntive/receptive oral intercourse, and antiretroviral therapy.\nYet, the infrequent application of HIV criminalization\nlaws, the rise of mass incarceration in America, and penal\npolicy changes in inmate HIV testing converge to raise 2\nimportant questions about the sexual health and criminal\ndemeanor of the HIV-positive community. First, recent work\nshows that growth in the criminal justice system has obscured\nnational estimates of wages, employment, educational attain-\nment, and political participation. As inmates are not included in\nhousehold-based sample surveys, national statistics on major\nsocial indicators are distorted, with some estimates being biased\nby as much as 60%.2 It is possible that such sample selectivity\namong HIV-positive inmates induce similar statistical biases\nthat inflate the overall prevalence and risk, belying the rationale\nfor criminalization laws in states that rely on HIV prevalence\nrates from household surveys like the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). There is some\nevidence that including inmates in national estimates of HIV\nand TB makes little difference, but that finding is based on 1\nwave of data that span 2 years.2 This study assesses bias over a\npopulation at risk of HIV exposure is contingent upon the\ninclusion of inmates.\nSecond, HIV criminalization laws emerged during the pre-\nART era when the potential for HIV transmission was very\nhigh.1,3 Failure to disclose one's HIV status placed romantic\npartners at risk for future infection, resulting in a sexual offense\nthat increased the risk of morbidity and mortality because very\nfew treatment options existed during the 1980s and early\n1990s.1 Furthermore, HIV legislation associated and codified\ninto law specific violent and nonsexual acts that legislators\ninaccurately feared could transmit HIV (biting, spitting, etc.).1,3\nThus, many states criminalized the failure to disclose one's HIV\nstatus as a sexual offence as well as violent behavior among\nindividuals living with HIV, while other states enacted penalty\nenhancements for HIV-positive defendants during sentencing\nEditor: Lauren Richey.\nFrom the Department of Criminology, Law and Society, University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, CA (BLS, KDM); and Department of Sociology,\nUniversity at Albany, SUNY, NY, USA (TAH).\nCorrespondence: Bryan Sykes, Department of Criminology, Law and\nSociety, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA\n(e-mail: blsykes@uci.edu).\nThe authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.\nCopyright # 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Yet\nresearch has not focused on how crimes committed by HIV-\npositive inmates differ from the overall crimes of other inmates.\nHIV criminalization laws rest partly on the assumption that the\noverall risk of transmitting the infection within the general\npopulation is high, regardless of treatment or safer sex practices.\nHowever, no research has assessed whether HIV-positive\ninmates are more or less likely to be jailed or imprisoned for\nviolent offenses, in comparison to HIV-negative inmates. If\nHIV criminalization laws are meant to redress illegalities\nassociated with sexually transmitting the infection without a\npartner's knowledge or violence that threatens public health, the\nlikelihood of serving sentences for violent acts should be greater\namong HIV-positive inmates (compared to non-HIV inmates)\nonce the distribution of possible offenses (violent, drug, prop-\nerty, etc.) is controlled.\nThis paper makes 3 contributions to the literature. First, we\nassess measurement biases in HIV prevalence from national\nhousehold-based surveys that do not include incarcerated popu-\nlation, which may be used to generate state-specific HIV\nprevalence rates in the absence of access to surveillance data.\nThese household surveys can be used to set national and state\nsocial policy on corrections and population health.2 Second, we\nshow how statistical biases in household surveys undermine the\nconceptual basis for HIV criminal laws, particularly for states\nthat draw on data from the noninstitutionalized population to\nmake general claims that buttresses social policy. Finally, we\npresent a general criticism of the legal basis for HIV criminal\nlaws that make assumptions about criminal intent and violent\ndispositions among individuals living with HIV/AIDS.1,3\nBACKGROUND\nmillion adults had some form of arrest or criminal conviction,\nrepresenting 30% of the American adult population.6 By the\nincarcerated in local, state, and federal correctional facilities,\nand another 4.79 million were under some form of criminal\njustice supervision.7 Exposure to the criminal justice system is\nnot uniform; race and class inequality in the likelihood of\nincarceration has grown over the last 40 years,8,9 with the\nlife-time risk of imprisonment among young, undereducated\nThe expansion of the criminal justice system is known to\nsignificantly shape population health. Incarceration is associ-\nated with an increased risk of infectious disease, stress, depres-\nsion, unhealthy eating habits, body mass indexes (BMI), and\nsmoking,12\u00ad16 and recent work links incarceration to excess\ninfant mortality in America and Denmark.17,18 Mass incarcera-\ntion has such a profound impact on levels of social inequality in\nAmerica that the health effects spill into and diffuse through\ncommunities, as male incarceration rates in the early 1980s\nthrough the mid-1990s are shown to be strongly associated with\nAIDS rates among men and women.19\nDuring the rise of the AIDS epidemic, state legislatures\nbegan legislating sexual and social behavior around HIV-status.\nTwenty-four states currently impose misdemeanor or felony\npenalties on HIV-positive people for engaging in a range of\npractices.20 Most statutes criminalize sexual contact without\nfirst disclosing one's HIV-positive status, regardless of whether\nthat contact poses a risk of transmitting the virus; others are\nwidely construed to criminalize a range of potential exposures,\neven behaviors that are not plausible transmission pathways\nsuch as spitting and biting.20 In addition, a handful of other\nstates impose sentence enhancements on HIV-positive defen-\ndants convicted of other sexual offenses such as rape or\nprostitution. In total, 32 states currently have an HIV-specific\ncriminal statute on the books.20\nAlthough HIV was largely terminal without treatment\nduring the pre-ART era, the introduction of antiretrovirals in\n1995 substantially increased survivorship. These treatments not\nonly transformed the disease into a chronic, manageable illness,\nbut also greatly reduced the infectiousness of those taking\nit.21,22 Data recently announced from a trial involving virally\nsuppressed partners in both heterosexual and same-sex sero-\ndiscordant relationships (where one partner is HIV-positive and\nthe other HIV-negative) who were not using condoms at least\nsome of the time reveal that, after an estimated 44,400 sexual\nencounters, zero transmissions were observed.23\nAlthough the science of HIV treatment and prevention has\ndramatically advanced in the 30 years since its discovery, the\ncriminal laws governing those infected with HIV have remained\nlargely static. The majority of HIV-specific criminal laws were\npanic about the disease and its potential to spread from minority\ncommunities to the general population.24,25 In this context,\nstates enacted broadly construed laws that could be used to\ncriminalize sexual contact without any risk of transmission.\nAdditionally, some policy debates have centered on highly\naberrant cases involving male defendants (often of color)\ninfecting multiple (often white) female partners.26 However,\nan analysis of convictions under Michigan's felony HIV dis-\nof convictions involved a defendant accused of transmitting the\ndisease to a partner.27 The vast majority of cases involved a\nsexual exposure without transmission, some involving no or low\nrisk sexual behaviors \u00ad such as a 2009 case involving an HIV-\npositive Michigan dancer accused of allowing a male client's\nnose to ``penetrate'' her vagina during a lapdance.27\nThe criminal justice system is known to structure and\nrecreate inequalities in health among inmates by selectively\ntesting prisoners for HIV depending on state-specific laws and\ninstitutional facility type (jail, state prison, etc.).28 For instance,\nalthough inmates are at a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS\nthan the general population,29 state legislatures enact different\nguidelines about when and where to test inmates for this\ninfection. In 2004, 18 states had policies specifically aimed\nat testing all inmates for HIV at admission into prison/jail, while\nonly 2 states had policies for testing inmates in custody, and 3\nstates tested prisoners upon release.30 Nationally, the number of\nstates that mandated HIV testing among inmates was greater\naround the dawn of the millennium than in subsequent years.\ninmates and began testing groups they deemed to be high-\nrisk.28 We assess the 2 critical suppositions of HIV criminaliza-\ntion laws: whether a prominent, national household survey\nroutinely used to generate state-specific estimates of HIV over-\nstates the level of prevalence in the population due to the\nexclusion of inmates; and whether inmates with HIV are more\nor less violent than non-HIV infected inmates.\n2 | www.md-journal.com Copyright # 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Data on the health and well-being of\nthe U.S. population have been gathered by NHANES surveys\nsince the 1960s. These data capture demographic, dietary, and\nhealth-related markers of a nationally representative sample of\nnial laboratory tests for HIV antibodies to estimate the preva-\nlence of HIV in the population. The age of the participants\nvaried by survey wave, with the range going from 18\u00ad49 in\nage range from 20 to 49 and apply survey weights to obtain\nnationally representative statistics by race. As the vast majority\nof inmates are male, we restrict our analysis to men.\nWe also leverage data from the Survey of Inmates in State,\nFederal, and Local custody. Data for the Survey of Inmates\nseries are collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and distributed\nby the Bureau of Justice Statistics.32\u00ad35 The Survey of Inmates\nis nationally representative sample of all inmates held in\ncorrectional facilities throughout the United States. Respon-\ndents include inmates being held pretrial, those serving local\nsentences, and those awaiting transfer into the custody of\nanother correctional facility. The Survey of Inmates in State\nand Federal Correctional Facilities was administered in 1997\nand 2004. Data from the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails were\nwere asked if they were ever tested for HIVand for the result of\nthe test. To construct panel estimates of HIV prevalence among\nAmerican inmates, we estimate the distribution of inmates who\nreport being positive by race, weighted in proportion to aggre-\ngate penal population counts from Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nEstimates from between survey years are linearly interpolated,\nand postsurvey year prevalence is assumed to follow the\nweighted distribution of the most recent survey. This method\nhas been used to construct time-series for parental incarceration,\nwage inequality, and the life-time risk of imprisonment.2,9\u00ad\n11,36\u00ad38 Further details on our methodology and additional data\nused to produce these estimates can be found in other work.2,10\nTo make the analysis consistent with NHANES, we limit the\nPopulation denominators to calculate prevalence rates are\nobtained from 2 sources. When weighted, NHANES totals\nrepresent the noninstitutionalized population. Another source\nof information about population counts come from the March\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS). Each month the CPS samples\nholds, and survey measures capture the demographic and labor\nmarket attributes of the noninstitutionalized population. CPS\ndata are jointly collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and the\nBureau of Labor Statistics, and the CPS has been fielded\nunder each of these surveys to ensure that any bias in rates due to\ninstitutionalization are not due to population count differences\nbetween surveys.\nAs this observational study relies on publicly available,\nsecondary data sources that have been anonymized for wide-\nspread use, the risk to potential subjects is low. The data have\nbeen collected by government agencies tasked with anonymiz-\ning survey participants and ensuring minimal harm, and the data\nhave been deidentified and cannot be linked. As such, the\nInstitutional Review Board at the University of California-\nIrvine classifies this research as exempt from review.40\nRESULTS\nTable 1 displays the descriptive statistics for the Survey of\nInmates and NHANES for the years that begin and end our\nsurvey. Although subsequent analyses are only for men, this\ntable is used to display the overall sample demographics. Over\n90% of all inmates are male, compared to almost half of\nrespondents who had their blood tested by NHANES. Although\namong American inmates, the mean age among the NHANES\nSimilarly, the racial composition of the inmates in jails and\nprisons remained fairly stable, with roughly 65% of all inmates\nbeing non-Hispanic Whites.

College educated\nmen and women, for example, increased their responsiveness by\n9.2%-points, with 62.1% of NHANES respondents having some\ncollege education.\nThe shifting educational distribution in these surveys\nraises important questions about whether HIV prevalence is\nconcealed and distorted when institutions like the criminal\njustice system concentrate disadvantage and inmates remain\noutside sample selection eligibility for national surveys. Indeed,\nsome scholars have raised this concern for a number of clinical\ntrial studies, where individuals unincarcerated in earlier waves\nof a study cannot be followed at later times due to incapacitation\nand IRB protocols around inmate research.41 Table 1 shows that\nthat the percentage of Americans who are HIV-positive\ninmates are disproportionately poor and possess low levels of\neducation,36 resulting in their exclusion from national house-\nhold-based surveys,2,38 a reexamination of HIV prevalence\nrates and bias due to their exclusion is warranted.\nQuantifying Bias in HIV Prevalence\nCurrently, more than 1.2 million people are living with\nHIV.42 Although national HIV prevalence estimates from the\nCDC are based on surveillance site statistics, national house-\nhold-based surveys like NHANES are another source of data for\nstates that seek to utilize social and epidemiological data on\nHIV prevalence within the population. The potential use of\nNHANES data to set social policy around state-specific HIV\ncriminalization laws has yet to be investigated.\nTo understand whether the rationale for HIV criminaliza-\ntion laws may be due to an overestimated risk of HIV spreading\nthroughout the population due violent and deviant behavior, the\nnumber of Americans living with HIV (i.e., the numerator) must\nbe standardized before adjusting the national prevalence rates\nfor individuals living outside of households or in institutions.\nThus, cases reported to the CDC by its surveillance programs\nmust be reconciled with national survey estimates from\nNHANES.

For instance, NHANES HIV-positive\ncases converge between NHANES and CDC estimates, with\nNHANES reporting 0.149% fewer infected individuals.\nPrevalence estimates require information from household\nsurveys on the noninstitutionalized to generate population\ncounts. The total population counts from NHANES differ\nsignificantly from the CPS. Population counts from NHANES\nproduce different HIV prevalence estimates than population\ncounts from CPS. Similar to Table 2, where the incident counts\ndiffered for the numerator, the population counts for the\ndenominator also induce sizeable differences in HIV prevalence\nrates. The population counts for the denominator (i.e., the\npopulation at risk of exposure) can induce sizeable differences\nin HIV prevalence rates. We fix the numerator to be the number\nof HIV cases from NHANES and vary only the population\ndenominators. If all members living in households have the\nTABLE 2.

Figure 1 shows the level of denominator bias\nassociated with survey selection. Positive estimates indicate that\nprevalence rates are higher when using the NHANES population\nas the base, and negative estimates indicate that using population\ntotals from the CPS lowers the prevalence rate. For example,\nwhile NHANES and CPS denominators made little difference in\npopulation counts have diverged between the surveys. Current\nestimates indicate that CPS population totals produce a rate that is\n7.8% lower than NHANES. Race-specific HIV prevalence rates\nare particularly distorted, as NHANES overrepresented preva-\nCPS population totals lowered HIV prevalence by 19.3% com-\npared to population counts from NHANES. Prior to 2002, CPS\npopulation rates underrepresented HIV prevalence among His-\npanics. After that period, however, NHANES overestimated their\nprevalence rates.\nAs population counts are known to produce different\nestimates before including inmates, we average CPS and\nNHANES population counts to limit the overall bias associated\nwith choosing between surveys. We estimate bias in the HIV\nprevalence rate due to excluding inmates from household-based\nsurveys in Figure 2. Positive numbers indicate that current HIV\nprevalence rates should adjusted upward by the corresponding\npercentage to include inmates. Negative numbers indicate that\nthe inclusion of inmates lowered prevalence rates by the\ncorresponding percentage. Including inmates generally\nincreases national HIV prevalence rates. Yet, for non-Hispanic\nBlacks, inmate inclusion lowers national HIV prevalence for\nmany of the years in our study. This finding is consistent with\npast research that examined 1 wave of NHANES data during the\nDangerous Liaisons?\nMost men are incarcerated for nonviolent and nonsexual\ncrimes. Table 3 presents the distribution of controlling offenses\n(or the most serious crime) among inmates by race. HIV-\npositive inmates were incarcerated for violent offenses at rates\nsubstantially lower than other inmates. For example, in 1999,\n22.1% of all inmates were incarcerated for violent offenses\ncompared to 14.5% of HIV-positive inmates, a 7.6%-point\ndifference (P < 0.001). The rise in mass incarceration changed\nthe overall offending composition by the end of our time series.\nBy 2012, the percentage of HIV-positive inmates incarcerated\nfor violent offenses was lower than the overall population by\nHispanic Black men living with HIV who committed a violent\nthan the overall population of Black inmates.\nFIGURE 2.

We report marginal effects, which\nexpress the rate of change in the dependent variable (i.e., the\npredicted probability) relative to a unit change in an indepen-\ndent variable.43,44 All models are evaluated at their mean\nvalues. HIV-positive men were 10%-points less likely to have\na violent offense than HIV-negative inmates. In fact, HIV-\npositive inmates are statistically more likely to be incarcerated\nfor drug and property crimes (2.6% and 7.3%, respectively), not\nsexual or violent offenses. Although drug and property crimes\nmay increase the likelihood of experiencing violence, these\nfindings indicate that HIV-positive inmates are significantly\nless violent than their counterparts.\nDISCUSSION\nWhen HIV entered the national consciousness in the\n1980s, HIV-positive people were quickly labeled as deviant\nby those holding homophobic views, increasing their willing-\nness to believe myths of dangerousness.45 Perceptions of HIV-\ninfected persons as risky, dangerous, and threatening permeated\npublic discourse to the point that a 1988 General Social Survey\nitem revealed that 63.7% of Americans were in favor of a\ngovernment mandate that would require HIV-positive individ-\nuals to wear identification tags.46 The stigma associated with\ninfection resulted in HIV criminalization laws that relied on\nnational statistics about HIV prevalence among high risk\ngroups, as well as misguided and biased assumptions about\nthe criminal nature of HIV-positive men and women.\nRecent studies suggest that HIV-specific criminal laws are\nnot uniformly applied across the population. One study shows\nthat HIV-positive heterosexual Black men are more likely to\nhave been convicted under the Michigan nondisclosure law as\ncompared to their White counterparts.47 Contrary to expec-\ntations, however, HIV-positive gay men in the state were much\nless likely to have faced conviction as compared to their\nheterosexual counterparts. These findings echo those of other\nwork,4 which shows that 80% of arrestees under Tennessee's\nHIV-specific criminal law, who were subsequently tried in\nwomen with opposite-gendered partners. Findings from Michi-\ngan and Tennessee underscore how HIV criminalization laws\nmay be differentially applied to segments of the population\nbased on beliefs about the risk of transmission, disclosure,\nviolent intentions, and institutional discrimination by race\nand sexual orientation.\nHIV criminalization laws promulgate myths of dangerous-\nness through the presumption of individual duplicity between\npartners and collective misunderstandings about the overall risk\nto the population at large. Distorted prevalence and incidence\nrates due to survey and sample bias contribute to such mis-\nconceptions by obscuring scientific facts about HIV trans-\nmission and the relative rate of violent offenses among those\nwho are infected. Our study finds that the population at risk of\nexposure is significantly overestimated and that HIV-positive\ninmates are significantly less likely to be incarcerated for\nviolent offenses. HIV-specific laws compound the stigma\nassociated with being HIV-positive, even if inmates are incar-\ncerated for nonviolent and nonsexual crimes. An unintended\nconsequence of this legislation is the further stigmatization of\nminority groups and communities, which may induce greater\nlevels and varied forms of deviance as a result of increased\nostracization and internalization of deviant labels.48,49\nWe show that the very premise of these criminalization\nlaws are problematic in at least 2 respects. First, the correctional\nsystem incarcerates many individuals experiencing the most\nserious social problems in the country. Prisons and jails con-\ncentrate disadvantaged men, most of whom have low levels of\neducation and are disproportionately non-White.36 The rise of\nmass incarceration since the 1980s has come to obscure basic\nsocial facts about a host of population processes, including HIV\nprevalence rates overtime when estimated using household-\nbased data. Thus, health advocates and legislators should\nexercise caution when relying on nonsurveillance data from\nhousehold surveys to devise state-specific social policy.\nSecond, HIV criminalization laws make explicit assump-\ntions about the intentionality and negligence of those living with\ninfections, particularly if they fail to disclose their HIV status.\nAs a matter of fact, a number of men and women have been\nprosecuted even after disclosing their infection and in the\nabsence of transmission, which serves to bolster claims about\nHIV stigma in the justice system.1,3,50 Furthermore, past charac-\nterizations of HIV-positive individuals as dangerous and violent\nare not validated by data on offense classifications of inmates.\nHIV-positive inmates are statistically less violent than their\ncounterparts and are more likely to be incarcerated for drug and\nproperty crimes. Thus, HIV criminalization laws focused on\nsexual violations deliberately codify unfounded beliefs about\nwho is at risk of exposure and the criminality of those who\nwould seek to expose them.\nAlthough public health institutions have been largely silent\non HIV-specific criminal laws until very recently, a recent DoJ\nreport calls for states to re-examine their HIV-specific criminal\nstatutes and assess the laws in accordance with scientific under-\nstandings of transmission risk.1 However, evidence suggests\nthat this critical stance toward HIV criminalization is not shared\nat all levels of the public health infrastructure. For example, one\nstudy found that local health officials in Michigan had devel-\noped specific tools and strategies for catching HIV-positive\nclients suspected of nondisclosure.50\nHIV criminalization laws impute a host of assumptions\nabout the HIV-positive community and their sexual partners.51\nThese laws were created during an era of public fear and\nscientific mystery about the evolution, progression, and trans-\nmission of the disease. Such legislation was enacted on specu-\nlation about the underlying risk of infection and the criminal\nintent of individuals living with HIV. Over 30 years after the\ndiscovery of this disease, HIV laws represent a relic of our\ncollective biases and misunderstandings that have since been\ncompounded by the rise of mass incarceration and its corre-\nsponding distortion of national prevalence estimates. In the\ninterest of public health and scientific validity, social scientists\nand legislators should reassess the evidence that purportedly\nundergirds characterizations of HIV-positive persons as danger-\nous liaisons with cruel intentions.\nREFERENCES\n1.
