Okafor4, and Michael N. Pham5\n Keywords\nfemale genital cutting, Igbo people, sexual conflict, sociosexuality\nIntroduction\nThe World Health Organization (WHO, 2014) defines female\ngenital cutting (FGC) as procedure(s) that involve partial or\ntotal removal of the external female genitalia or other injury\nto the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons. According\nto the United Nations Children's Fund (2013), approximately\n130 million women and girls have undergone FGC worldwide.\nMost of these women are located in 29 African countries. FGC\nhas no health benefits: In fact, women who have undergone\nFGC experience many short-term (e.g., serious infections) and\nlong-term health consequences (e.g., obstetric complications\nand posttraumatic stress disorder; Reisel & Creighton, 2015).\nThe major cause that perpetuates the practice of FGC is\nensuring female conformity with social norms, particularly\nwith those involving sexual restraint and marriageability (Alm-\numents conflicting results. Some research documents that FGC\ndecreases women's sexual satisfaction, orgasm frequency, and\nsexual desire (Alsibiani & Rouzi, 2010; Andersson, Rymer,\nDenison, 2012). In contrast, other research documents no\nassociation between women who underwent FGC and the\noccurrence of premarital sex or sexual satisfaction (Ahmadu,\nRossem & Gage, 2009). These measures (e.g., premarital sex,\nsexual satisfaction, and orgasm frequency) do not fully capture\nmany important aspects of sociosexuality--defined by Simp-\nson and Gangestad (1991) as individual differences in willing-\nness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations. In particular,\nprevious research has not yet investigated whether women with\nFGC are less likely to pursue extramarital affairs than women\nwithout FGC.\n1 Department of Psychology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria\n2 Department of Biology, Trnava University, Trnava, Slovakia\n3 Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia\n4 Department of Psychology, Enugu State University of Science and\nTechnology, Enugu, Nigeria\n5 Department of Psychology, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPavol Prokop, Department of Biology, Trnava University, Hornopotoc\nna\nEmail: pavol.prokop@savba.sk\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nMen and women have sometimes conflicting reproductive\nthat have produced sex-specific adaptations wherein one sex\nmanipulates the reproductive interests of the other sex (Arnq-\nple, a woman may commit sexual infidelity, which allows her\nto receive benefits from her in-pair partner (e.g., protection,\nresources, and paternal care for offspring; Hrdy, 2000; Scelza,\npair partner (e.g., a sire with ``good genes'' for her offspring;\nsee Gildersleeve, Haselton, & Fales, 2014). Men whose partner\ncommits sexual infidelity are at risk of cuckoldry--unwitting\ninvestment into genetically unrelated offspring. Estimates doc-\nument that 1\u00ad30% of children are fathered by extra-pair copu-\nlation (Platek & Porter, 2012). In response to the significant\nreproductive costs of cuckoldry, men evolved ``anticuckoldry''\nadaptations designed to thwart their partner's sexual infidelity\n(e.g., jealousy in response to sexual infidelity; Platek & Shack-\nelford, 2006). For example, men who suspect or know about\ntheir partner's sexual infidelity are more likely to perform var-\nious anticuckoldry tactics, including mate retention behaviors\nsexual coercion (Finkelhor & Yllo, 1985; Goetz & Shackel-\nprecipitated by male anticuckoldry tactics, FGC may be perpe-\ntuated at the cultural level (e.g., cultural tradition) because of\nthe patrilocal and patrilineal nature of some societies (e.g., the\nIgbo of the current research). Thus, women's motivation to\nencourage a female relative to undergo FGC may be a strategy\nto increase her marriageability under the context of a male-\ndominated society.\nThe Current Research\nMen may benefit from partnering with a woman with FGC\n(compared to a woman without FGC). Women with FGC may\nexperience decreased interest in extramarital relationships and,\nconsequently, are less likely to place their partner at risk of\ncuckoldry. We hypothesize that women who have undergone\nFGC will have a more restricted sociosexuality than women\nwho have not undergone FGC. We used data obtained from the\nIgbo people, a preindustrial society living in in Southeastern\nNigeria where it is believed, according to Igbo oral tradition,\nthat FGC reduces woman's sexual arousal and prevents extra-\nmarital sexual behavior. This view is consistent with traditional\nviews of the ancestral origin of FGC in many cultures (e.g.,\nhypothesis are difficult to obtain due to the sensitive nature of\nthe subject (Reisel & Creighton, 2015). Furthermore, original\nAfrican tribes are disappearing or being replaced by modern\nquently an urgent need to investigate this topic to plan effective\ninterventions (Abdulcadir, Rodriguez, & Say, 2015). The aim\nof this study is to examine whether FGC suppresses woman's\nwillingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations.\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nWomen (N \u00bc 93) from a rural Igbo community in South-\neastern Nigeria participated. The Igbos are among the most\npopulous ethnic group in Nigeria and inhabit five states\nof Southeastern Nigeria. The community is located about\n50 km from the city center. There is limited exposure to\nmodern life within the community and no electricity is\nsupplied to the area. There is no hospital facility and\nmembers of the community travel up to 15 km to access\nmedical facilities in a nearby community. The major means\nof transport is by foot and motorcycles because of the poor\nstate of the local (unpaved) roads. The community is com-\nprised mainly of farmers, the majority of whom live in farm\nhouses built with local materials. Participants were predomi-\nnantly subsistence farmers of extremely low-economic status\n(more than half of population is unemployed). We drew our\nsample from a single rural community (a village), where FGC\nis predominant (see Results section). Although the exact pop-\nulation of the community is not documented, we estimated that\nthis village contained 120 households. We surveyed all the\navailable women in the community at the time of the study\nand all those who volunteered to participate were included in\nthe study.\nAlthough FGC is common in most Igbo communities,\nresearch demonstrates that not all women undergo FGC\nSnow, Slanger, Okonofua, Oronsaye, & Wacker, 2002). The\nreasons that some women do not undergo FGC remain unclear.\nIgbo communities do not coerce but rather encourage people to\nundergo FGC. Because FGC is performed at an early age, the\nfamily members ultimately influence whether young girls\nundergo FGC. However, recent campaigns aimed at discoura-\nging this practice has led to the decline in FGC in most com-\nmunities. Indeed, women from earlier generations are more\nlikely to have undergone FGC than females from later\ngenerations.\nIgbos are predominantly patrilineal and patrilocal and the\ncommunity that we sampled is a typical case. Extended family\nsignificantly influences lives of the Igbo, including aspects\npertaining to marriage choices, fertility, sexual life, and par-\nenting (Smith, 2010). The Igbo society places great social\nrestrictions on women's sexuality. Although there is mild\ntolerance when unmarried women participate in casual sexual\nencounters, there is zero tolerance when married women par-\nticipate in casual sexual encounters (i.e., infidelity; Smith,\n2010). Women who are married are expected to remain sexu-\nally faithful to their partner, even though husbands are\nsocially permitted to pursue extramarital affairs (Smith,\n2010). Further, women have difficulty in remarrying because\nthe Igbo society frowns upon divorce. Indeed, divorce rates\nappear to be relatively low (*2%; Odimegwu & Zerai, 1996).\nThus, female sexuality is highly restricted in the Igbo society\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nProcedure\nWe conducted face-to-face interviews with individual parti-\ncipants after obtaining their consent. All interviewers were\nfemale assistants trained by Ike E. Onyishi and Chiedozie\nO. Okafor. The questionnaire was used to collect informa-\ntion on whether the participant had undergone FGC and, if\nso, at what age the FGC was performed. Note that FGC is\nboth common and socially acceptable among the Igbo peo-\nple, so responses are unlikely to be influenced by social\ndesirability biases. A total of 75 women self-reported hav-\ning undergone FGC and 18 women did not. Although the\nrespondents in our study were unable to explain the exact\ntype of FGC they had, we presumed that majority of them\nhad the simple excision, which is the commonest type\nWe asked participants whether they were married (n \u00bc 88),\nsingle (n \u00bc 3), or divorced (n \u00bc 2). Participants reported their\ncurrent age, their age when they underwent FGC procedure,\nand their sexual orientation (100% reported to be exclusive\nheterosexuals).\nMeasuring Sociosexuality\nFor purposes of this study, we defined sociosexuality as indi-\nvidual willingness to engage in a sexual relationship with other\nperson than own current sexual partner. We measured socio-\nsexuality using the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory\nlated into the Igbo language and the responses were coded by\nresearchers. The SOI-R is a 9-item scale that provides an over-\nall measure of sociosexual orientation (SOI--Total score). The\nvalidity and reliability of sociosexuality-type measures have\nbeen established across various cultures, including Africa\n(Schmitt, 2005), suggesting that the SOI-R was an appropriate\nfor the current research. The SOI-R scale has three subscales.\nThe Behavior subscale (SOI--Behavior) measures the number\nof casual sex partners and frequency of change in partners. The\nAttitude subscale (SOI--Attitude) measures the participant's\ndisposition toward short-term sexual encounters. The Desire\nsubscale (SOI--Desire) measures the frequency of sexual fan-\ntasies or arousal in relation to potential mates with whom the\nindividual is not currently in a committed relationship (see\nAppendix for the full version of the SOI-R). A high SOI-R\nscore indicates unrestricted sociosexual orientation (i.e., a pro-\npensity to engage in more short-term sexual relationships and\nto commit infidelity).\nEthics Statement\nThis research was approved by the Institutional Ethical Com-\nmittee, Department of Psychology, University of Nigeria (No:\nRef/Psy/E/14/010). All participants provided verbal consent\nto participate in this study. No written consent could be\nobtained, because most of the participants were not literate\nand could not understand or sign the consent form. All\nconsents were recorded with paper-and-pencil method. This\nconsent procedure was approved by the Institutional Ethical\nCommittee.\nResults\nolder than women without FGC (age: M \u00bc 33.2, SE \u00bc 2.1, n \u00bc\nwith age (Mesko\n\u00b4, La\nanalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to predict participants'\nSOI-R scores from whether or not they had undergone FGC,\ncontrolling statistically for their age. We conducted Box\u00adCox\ntransformations on SOI-R scores to achieve normality. Z2\np\nwas\nused to measure the effect size. Statistical tests were performed\nwith Statistica (v8, StatSoft 2007, Tulsa, OK, http://\nwww.statsoft.com).\nAll participants who underwent FGC reported receiving\nthe procedure within the first 12 months of their life, the\nmajority (76%) of whom had undergone the procedure dur-\ning the first 5\u00ad8 days of life. In support of the hypothesis,\nwomen with FGC had a significantly lower SOI--Total\np\nstatistical power of this difference was high (observed\npower \u00bc 0.99), suggesting that the sample sizes were suf-\nficient for rejecting the null hypothesis.

This suggests that if\nthe study were to be replication 100 times, we would cor-\nrectly reject the null hypothesis during 97\u00ad99% of those\nreplications.

One of the major motivations for FGC is\nto ensure that a woman will be uninterested in sexual rela-\nalthough most Igbo women seem to be unaware of this\n(Adinma & Agbai, 1999). Studies demonstrating that\nwomen who have undergone FGC have lower sexual satis-\nfaction provide some indirect evidence for this idea (Alsi-\ntest of this question has been made.\nThe current research is the first to document that a\nwoman's interest in engaging in a sexual relationship with\nan extra-pair partner(s) is significantly inhibited by FGC. The\ncurrent research provides support for the previously hypothe-\nsized motivations for FGC across cultures (Almroth et al.,\nevolutionary perspective, FGC decreases men's paternity\nuncertainty by restricting women's sociosexuality--including\nwomen's desires to pursue extramarital relationships. Women\nmay obtain benefits from extra-pair matings (e.g., a higher\nnumber of children: Scelza, 2011; food for children: Scelza,\nFGC is costly to women and potentially beneficial to men,\nindicating that the origin and maintenance of FGC is partially\nattributable to sexual conflict over reproduction (Gorelik &\nAnother possible cost of ``unrestricted sexuality'' is con-\ntracting sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnan-\ncies. These costs are exacerbated in rural conditions where\nour research was carried out because women receive minimal\nmedical care (e.g., contraception and treatment for various\ninfections). Thus, FGC could be ancestrally motivated to\nreduce mortality from infectious diseases and unwanted\npregnancies.\nOur data suggest that FGC reduces the risk of female infi-\ndelity. More than 30% of Himba women living in Namibia,\nfor example, reported having had at least one extramarital\naffair resulting in 17.6% of extra-pair children (Scelza,\n2011), which are highest rates of extra-pair paternity than\nhave been recorded among small-scale societies (but see\npaternity in a traditional African population). Himba women\ndo not, however, undergo FGC (Brooke A. Scelza, personal\ncommunication, March 6, 2015), which may at least partially\nexplain the high rates of their extra-pair behavior relative to\nother similar small-scale societies. Unfortunately, genetic\ndata on extra-pair paternity in traditional societies are scarce\navailable data are likely insufficient for more rigorous tests\nof nonpaternity rates among societies with FGC versus with-\nout FGC.\nFor obvious ethical reasons, we did not employ an\nexperimental design for the current research. Consequently,\nwe cannot conclude that FGC per se directly causes the\nrestriction of sociosexuality. It is possible that girls who\nundergo FGC--relative to those who do not undergo\nFGC--received familial upbringings that more strongly\nendorse female sexual fidelity. In other words, parents who\nendorse their daughters receiving FGC also raise their\ndaughters to be more sexually restricted. Thus, a third vari-\nable (e.g., familial upbringing) may mediate the relation-\nship between women who undergo FGC and their\nsociosexuality. Future research should collect data on the\nsociosexuality of parents to probe potential mediation\neffects. Another limitation is that some factors beyond\nFGC could account for some variance of the results. For\nexample, a survey in Egypt showed that females with FGC\nare less educated and are less wealthy than those who did\nnot undergone FGC (El-Zanaty & Way, 2009). Women's\nwealth is associated with higher degree of polyandry in\nsome traditional societies (Ardener, Ardener, & Warming-\nton, 1960), and wealthy women may have more sexual\nopportunities due to enhanced attraction to males. Further\nresearch needs necessarily to control for these potentially\nconfounding variables.\nTo conclude, FGC is a manifestation of sexual conflict\nover reproduction. Practicing FGC may be considered an\nextended phenotype of men's sexual proprietariness at\nthe expense of women's reproductive interests: It appears\nthat the practice of FGC restricts women's sociosexuality--\nincluding their desire to commit sexual infidelity--\nwhich may decrease men's paternal uncertainty. A deeper\nunderstanding of the proximate mechanisms that inhibit\nsociosexuality among women with FGC requires further\nresearch.\nAppendix\nFrequencies of women's responses on SOI-R question-\nnaire with respect to occurrence of FGC.
