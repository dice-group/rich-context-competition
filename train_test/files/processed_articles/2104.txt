In multivariate models, neither being\nunaware of the four partner risk factors nor perceiving a\npartner as being high risk was associated with condom use.\nContextual factors associated with decreased odds of con-\ndom use were having sex with a main partner, homeless-\nness in the past year, alcohol use during sex, and crack use\nin the past 30 days.

Contextual factors,\nsex with a main partner in particular, decrease condom use\ndespite awareness of partner risk factors.\n",

Zule\nResearch Triangle Institute International,\nRaleigh-Durham, North Carolina, USA\nSurveillance data for 2005 indicate that women now rep-\nresent one quarter of all new cases of HIV [3]; African\nAmerican women are disproportionately affected, consti-\ntuting 67% of reported cases [3]. Due to the late devel-\nopment of HIV testing and identification and the lack of\nearly and adequate interventions, acquired immunodefi-\nciency syndrome (AIDS), the group of conditions caused\nby HIV as the immune system fails, is the leading cause of\ndeath among African American women aged 25\u00ad34 and the\nfifth leading cause of death among African American\nwomen aged 35\u00ad44 [1]. The increased transmission of HIV\nto women through heterosexual contact raises questions\nabout the male partners who are the source of their infec-\ntion. Despite high levels of public understanding of the risk\nfactors and behaviors related to the transmission of HIV,\nlevels of condom use remain unaccountably low [4, 5],\nsuggesting that there are gaps in our understanding of the\nrelationship between individual knowledge and behavioral\nresponse.\nGiven these epidemiological data, it is likely that many\nwomen may be unaware of or wrong in their assessments\nabout their partners' risk factors [6\u00ad8] and/or they may be\nengaging in unprotected sex despite knowledge of partner\nrisk factors [9, 10]. Research indicates that women are\nmore likely to contract HIV from main partners or partners\nconsidered to be ``close'' due to the greater likelihood of\nhaving unprotected sex with them compared with casual\npartners or sex trade partners [5, 11]. Women may perceive\nmain or close partners as being ``safe'' (i.e., monogamous\nor HIV negative) [5, 12], albeit possibly incorrectly [7, 8,\n13], or they may perceive them as potentially risky but they\nhave other, competing priorities such as perceived partner\ndisapproval of condom use [14], fear of violence [10] and\nloss of financial support [15] due to requesting that a\npartner use a condom, or placing love for their partner over\nconcerns about their own health [9]. Despite well-estab-\nlished evidence that the risk of HIV transmission to women\nis greatest with main or close partners and a few studies\nindicating risky sexual behaviors among HIV serodiscor-\ndant couples [16, 17], the relative role of perceptions of\npartner risk factors and behaviors, given contextual factors\nsuch as partner type and substance use, remains largely\nunexamined.\nMen's primary risk factors that contribute to HIV\ntransmission to women include: positive HIV status--the\nhigh prevalence of HIV among African American men in\nparticular [3, 18]--having concurrent (i.e. overlapping)\npartners [19], behavioral bisexuality [20], and injection\ndrug use. While some literature suggests that women may\nbe either unaware of or incorrectly perceive their partners'\nspecific risk factors for HIV infection [2, 7, 8, 21], little is\nknown about the extent to which women are aware of their\npartners' risk factors, the effect of women's perceptions of\npartner risk factors on condom use, or the moderating\neffects of contextual factors on the relationship between\nperceptions of partner risk and condom use (or the\nreverse--the moderating effects of perceived partner risk\non the relationship between contextual factors and condom\nuse).\nThe influence of risk perceptions on condom use and\nother protective health prevention behaviors is well-docu-\nmented through risk perception models such as the health\nbelief model and the theory of reasoned action [22, 23], but\nsuch models often do not simultaneously include percep-\ntions of partner risks or important situational and contex-\ntual factors that may uniquely influence the protective\nbehaviors of the economically disadvantaged women who\nare most at risk for HIV [24]. Such analytic deficiencies\nmay explain why models examining the role of perceived\nrisk in HIV risk behaviors have had mixed results and may\nbe limited in their applicability [24]. Several scholars have\nnoted that the application of a single theory of health\nbehavior decision-making and behavior change cannot\npossibly address all of the factors influencing condom use,\nparticularly among economically disadvantaged women\nknowledge of her own HIV status [31, 32], casual versus\nchronic substance use [33\u00ad39], and sex with a main or\nclose partner compared with another type of partner, such\nas an unknown partner or a partner with whom sex is\nexchanged for drugs or money [5, 11, 14]. There is a need\nfor theoretical models that ``take more seriously the social\ncontexts in which decisions about health behaviors are\nmade and the constraints that individuals face in making\ntheir choices'' [24].\nIn addition to adding contextual factors to risk percep-\ntion models, some suggest that data on sexual behaviors\nwould be more precise if measured at the event or episode\nlevel, within the context of specific sexual episodes, to\naccount for factors that may vary by episode [40\u00ad42] and to\nassist with recall of such practices through appropriate\ninterview methodologies [43]. Risk behaviors are not likely\nperceived as the same for each person [24] or for each\nsexual relationship. Using appropriate statistical method-\nologies to examine behaviors within the context of specific\nepisodes that take partner type, among other factors, into\naccount may be particularly important for women because\nthey typically demonstrate riskier behaviors with main or\nclose partners than with other kinds of partners [5, 14, 44]\nand often tend to make critical decisions about their own\nwell-being within the context of close relationships with\nThis article examines the influence of women's per-\nceptions of four partner risk factors--HIV status, bisexual\nbehavior, sexual partner concurrency (i.e., their having\nother partners that overlap in time), and injection drug\nuse--on condom use at the event-level, taking into account\ntype of partner, homelessness, the woman's HIV status,\nand drug and alcohol use by the woman and by her partner.\nExploring the relationship between a woman's perceptions\nof partner behaviors and condom use within specific sexual\nepisodes may help illuminate whether awareness of partner\nrisk factors is protective against HIV through increased\ncondom use and whether consideration of such contextual\nfactors affects the relationship between risk perceptions\nand condom use. Such illumination would, in turn, assist in\nthe design or adaptation of HIV prevention strategies to\noptimize their impact.\nBased on the basic elements of the health belief model,\nwhich suggests that awareness of one's own risk for and\nsusceptibility to disease are associated with protective\nbehaviors [46], we hypothesized that women's perceptions\nthat a male partner was HIV positive, had concurrent\npartners, was also having sex with men, and had a history\nof injection drug use would be associated in univariate\nmodels (i.e., models with a single predictor variable) with\nincreased odds of condom use, before contextual factors\nwere taken into account. We also hypothesized that sex\nwith a main partner, homelessness, and the woman's and\nman's drug and alcohol use would be associated with\ndecreased odds of condom use and that the woman's\npositive HIV status would be associated with increased\nodds of condom use, and that we would see interaction\neffects between partner risk perceptions and these contex-\ntual variables.\nAs noted, some studies have examined associations\nbetween perceived risk and protective behaviors, but few\nhave examined associations between perceptions of risk of\nspecific sexual partners during specific sexual episodes.\nEvent-level, partner-specific data allow for the examination\nof these relationships.\nMethods\nSample\nRespondents were women (n = 1,967) from the three US\nsites (Los Angeles, Chicago, and Raleigh-Durham) that\ntook part in the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)\nSexual Acquisition and Transmission of HIV Cooperative\nThese women were drawn from the full sample\n(n = 8,355) of male and female respondents from the two\nwaves of the larger study. The primary goal of SATHCAP\nwas to examine the role of substance use and related\nbehaviors in accelerating the sexual diffusion of HIV from\nhigh-risk individuals (men who have sex with men [MSM],\nand drug users [DU]) to the general heterosexual popula-\ntion. Using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method-\nology, men and women in the full sample were recruited\nbecause they were either MSM, DU, or sex partners of\nMSM or DU. RDS is a peer-driven, chain-referral sampling\napproach that can efficiently yield large samples of diffi-\ncult-to-access populations such as MSM and DU [47\u00ad53].\nThe women selected had to be eligible as DU, i.e., they\nreported using (by injection or not) heroin, crack, powder\ncocaine, or methamphetamine in the past 6 months or they\ninjected some other drug, or as sex partners of an MSM or\nDU already recruited. The two study waves were almost\nidentical in methodology, but wave 2 incorporated small\nrecruitment changes in order to obtain a greater number of\nsexual partners of higher-risk individuals.\nProcedures\nStudy procedures and consent forms at all sites were\napproved by each institution's Institutional Review Board.\nSATHCAP investigators conducted a two-wave, cross-\nsectional study across all sites using RDS to recruit DU and\nMSM [54]. All sites began recruitment in each SATHCAP\nwave with the selection of ``seeds,'' i.e., outgoing, highly\nsocial members of a social network of either MSMs or\nmale or female DUs who were willing to participate and to\nalso recruit individuals they knew (Fig. 1). Seeds had to\nmeet the study's eligibility requirements, as follows: (1)\nMSM: a male who reported having sex with another man in\nthe past 6 months; and/or (2) DU: a male or female who\nreported using crack cocaine, powder cocaine, or heroin, or\ninjecting some other drug in the past 6 months. In the first\nwave, seeds were given three coupons after participating in\nthe study interview and testing for HIV and other sexually\ntransmitted infections to recruit other primary risk group\nmembers (male or female DU or MSM) and three coupons\nto recruit their male or female sex partners. In the second\nwave, recruitment criteria changed to increase recruitment\nof non drug-using sexual partners of these high-risk par-\nticipants. In wave 2, seeds initially were given two coupons\nto recruit other primary risk group members and two\ncoupons to recruit a sexual partner of the opposite sex. All\nsites eventually increased the number of primary risk group\ncoupons to four in order to increase recruitment rates.\nRespondents had to present authenticated coupons and\nmeet the study's eligibility requirements. Respondents who\ncompleted the study also were eligible to become recruiters\nif they were willing. Eligible respondents completed the\nstudy's audio, computerized, self-administered interview\n(ACASI), and provided biological samples for HIV and\nSTI testing. Those who completed study procedures were\ncompensated between $35 and $50 for their time and\nbetween $15 and $25 if they recruited an eligible\nparticipant. Wave 1 respondents could not participate in\nWave 2. No follow-up interviews were conducted. (See\nIguchi et al. [54] for a detailed description of SATHCAP\nstudy procedures.)\nMeasures\nThe ACASI asked about demographics, health and health\nbehavior, HIV risks such as drug and alcohol use, types of\nsexual partnerships, and other risk behaviors. Drug use and\nsexual risk questions were asked about global (typical) and\nevent-level (specific) behaviors. Global questions asked if\nthey had ever engaged in certain behaviors, for example,\n``have you ever used crack'' and, if so, ``how many days in\nthe past 30 have you used crack,'' and so on. Event-level\nquestions asked about specific behaviors in which they\nengaged during their last sexual contact with each of the\nsexual partners whose initials they provided at the start of\nthe event-level questions. Event-level questions asked\nquestions such as, ``the last time you had sex with (partner\nwith initials `AA'), did you use crack/methamphetamine/\netc.'' These questions were asked about their last sexual\nacts with up to five partners. Respondents first were asked\nabout their last three partners. If their last three partners\nwere not also an injecting partner or main partner, they\nwere then asked about behaviors with any injecting and\nmain partners.\nThe dependent variable was defined as having protected\nvaginal sex (i.e., used a condom throughout the whole\nsexual episode) during the last sexual event with any of up\nto five sexual partners. The unit of analysis was the specific\nsexual event. Individual-level contextual predictors inclu-\nded: (1) race/ethnicity; (2) homelessness; (3) woman's HIV\nstatus; and (4) woman's use of crack, methamphetamine or\nheroin in the 30 days preceding the interview. Event-level\npartner risk perception variables included: (1) partner HIV\nstatus; (2) partner bisexuality; (3) partner concurrency (i.e.,\nperception of a partner having other partners at the same\ntime); and (4) whether the partner had ever injected drugs.\nEvent-level contextual predictor variables included: (1)\nMSM Seed\nMen Who Had Sex with a Man (MSM) in\nthe Past 6 Months\nDU Seed\nMales or Females Who Used Crack,\nMethamphetamine, Powder Cocaine or\nInjected another Drug in the Past 6 Months\n(DU)\nOR\n3 Primary Risk Group\nMembers\n3 Sex Partners of Primary Risk\nGroup Members\nHad Sex with a Primary Risk Group Member\nin Past 6 Months\n3 Sex Partners of Sex Partners\nHad Sex with a Sex Partner of Primary Risk\nGroup in Past 6 Months\n(Sex partners of sex partners did not become\nrecruiters)\nOR\n3 Primary Risk\nGroup\nMembers\n3 Sex Partners\nof Primary\nRisk Group\nMembers\nOR\nOngoing\nrecruitment by\nprimary risk\ngroup and their\nsex partners\nFig. 1 Original SATHCAP recruitment design\npartner race; (2) partner type (not a main partner vs. main\npartner); (3) exchange of sex for money or drugs; (4)\nwoman's use of alcohol, crack, powder cocaine, metham-\nphetamine or heroin during the sexual episode; and (5)\npartner's use of alcohol, crack, powder cocaine, metham-\nphetamine or heroin during the sexual episode.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe analyzed the data in three stages. First, we modeled\nunivariate logistic random effects to examine the rela-\ntionship between each of the four perception variables and\ncondom use, without controlling for contextual variables.\nNext we fit models for each perception variable that con-\ntained demographics variables (e.g., respondent race and\npartner race) and each contextual variable to determine the\nspecific effects of each contextual variable and the rela-\ntionship between the perception variables and condom use,\nfirst testing the contextual variables individually (to\ndetermine which, if any, affected the relationship between\nrisk perceptions and condom use) and then together.\nFinally, we fit one logistic regression random effects model\nthat contained only the variables from the previous models\nwhich significantly increased or decreased the odds of\ncondom use at the 0.05 level. We forced into each model a\nsite variable and a coupon type variable to control for study\ncity (Los Angeles, Raleigh-Durham, and Chicago) and for\nthe way in which the woman was recruited--as a seed, a\ndrug user, or as a sex partner. We conducted Wald tests to\ntest the fit with those variables having more than two cat-\negories in each model. We also tested for interactions\nbetween each perception variable and each contextual\nvariable. Given the large number of interactions we tested\n(44) and the expectancy that two interactions would be\nsignificant at the p = 0.05 level by chance alone, we did\nnot include interactions in the final model unless they were\nsignificant at the 0.01 level.\nTo properly accommodate the multiple observations\n(i.e., sex partners) from a single respondent, all models\nwere multi-level random effects logistic regression models\n(STATA version 10.0, xtlogit, random effects) [55]. Ran-\ndom effects models can estimate effects for both individ-\nual-level and event-level covariates [55].\nreport any vaginal sex with a recent sexual partner and\nwere omitted from the analysis. An additional 165 were\nexcluded because they had data missing at random for at\nleast one partner (i.e., events with missing data were not\nassociated with specific demographic characteristics or\noutcomes) for one or more variables due to errors in skip\npatterns or other errors. Only a small percentage (2%) of\nrespondents had missing responses due to refusing to\nanswer a question. These also were excluded.\nResults\nDemographics and Individual-Level Risk\nCharacteristics\nWomen who participated in the study were between 18 and\n73 years of age, with a mean age of 41 (median and\nmode = 42), and were predominantly African American\n(74%) and were poor (Table 1). The majority (70%) earned\nless than $500 per month and reported having no health\ninsurance (60%). Five percent (n = 89) reported being\nHIV positive and 40% reported not being aware of their\nHIV status.\nMost women (93%) reported vaginal sex in the past\n6 months and of these, 67% reported unprotected vaginal\nsex for at least one episode. Seventy-three percent were\ndrug users; half reported crack cocaine use in the past\n30 days and almost a third reported heroin use. The\nmajority (72%) reported getting drunk on at least one day\nout of the past 30 days.\nPartner and Event-Level Risk Characteristics\nWomen generally believed partners were not bisexual\n(67%) and that partners did not inject drugs (73%); how-\never, many women were not aware of their partners' HIV\nstatus (56%) (Table 2). Almost half (49%) believed that\ntheir sexual partners had had concurrent partners. In 43%\nof episodes, women had exchanged sex for money or drugs.\nIn about one-third, women reported that they (33%) and/or\ntheir partners (31%) used crack. Women and their partners\nused methamphetamine during a very small percentage of\nevents (2% each), while in 28% and 25% of events women\nand partners, respectively, had used heroin.\nUnivariate Associations between Partner Risk\nPerception Variables and Condom Use\nIn univariate models, women who perceived that their\npartners had concurrent partners were more likely to have\nused a condom during a sexual event (Table 3). In addition,\na woman's ignorance of her partner's risk status (i.e., she\nindicated she did not know if her partner had HIV, had\nconcurrent partners, had engaged in bisexual behavior, or\nwas a drug injector) was associated with significantly\nhigher odds of condom use.\nMultivariate Models: Adjusted Effects of Partner Risk\nPerception Variables on Condom Use\nAlthough results varied slightly for each partner risk per-\nception model, in general adding partner type (not a main\npartner v. main partner) and/or woman's HIV status (HIV\nnegative, HIV positive, and don't know) to each model\ndiminished the effects of the perception variables on con-\ndom use before any other contextual factors were added,\nwith the exception of perceptions of perceived partner\ninjection drug use (Table 4). Specifically, when both\npartner type and woman's HIV status were added to the\npartner HIV status and partner bisexuality models, the\nperception variables (i.e., not knowing a partner's HIV\nstatus and not knowing if a partner was bisexual) no longer\nwere significant predictors of condom use. When we added\npartner type alone to the perceived partner concurrency\npartner model, neither perceived concurrency nor lack of\nawareness of concurrency significantly predicted condom\nuse. Adding contextual variables to the perceived injection\ndrug use model did not change the significance of the effect\nof not knowing a partner's injection history; however, the\nWald test was no longer significant (data not shown),\nindicating the ultimate non-significance of the variable in\nthe multivariate model.\nFinal Multivariate Models: Associations of Contextual\nVariables and Condom Use\nContextual factors associated (additively) with decreased\nodds of condom use were having sex with a main partner,\nTable 1 Demographics and individual-level risk characteristics\n%b n\nAge\nRace\nSelf-reported HIV status\nIncome per month\nHad any unprotected vaginal sex with any male\npartner in the last 6 months\na Table includes all women in the sample; women who did not have\nvaginal sex were removed later during analysis\nb May not sum to 100% due to rounding\nTable 2 Partner and event-level risk episode characteristics\n%b n\nPerception of partner HIV status\nPerception of partner bisexuality\nPerception of partner concurrency\nDo not know if partner has concurrent partners 19 778\nPerception of partner injection drug use\nDo not know if partner injects drugs 6 236\nPartner type\nWoman used methamphetamine during sexual event 2 71\nPartner used methamphetamine during sexual event 2 83\na n is higher than the number of respondents due to respondents\nreporting on multiple sexual episodes (n = # of events)\nb May not sum to 100% due to rounding\nthe woman being homeless in the past year, the woman's\nalcohol use during the sexual episode, and the woman's use\nof crack in the past 30 days, holding constant all other\nfactors (Table 5). The only contextual factor associated\nwith increased odds of condom use was the woman's HIV\npositive status. Contextual factors not associated with\nincreased or decreased odds of condom use were the\nwoman's race or her partner's race, exchange of sex for\nmoney or drugs, the woman's use of methamphetamine in\nthe past 30 days, the woman's or her partner's use of crack\nor methamphetamine during a sexual episode, and the\npartners' use of alcohol during the sexual episode.\nTable 3 Univariate random\nintercept logistic regression\nmodels\na n is lower than total number\nof events due to missing data\nProtected vaginal sex (n = 1,667 individuals,\nPartner HIV statusb (ref = negative)\nPartner bisexualityb (ref = not bisexual)\nPartner concurrencyb\nPartner injection drug useb (ref = no history)\nTable 4 Multivariate random\nintercept logistic regression\nmodels: adjusted effects of\nperception variables after\nadding partner type and\nwoman's HIV status\na n is lower than total number\nof events due to missing data\nProtected vaginal sex (n = 1,667 individuals,\nPartner HIV status (ref = negative)\nPartner type (ref = not main partner)\nWoman's HIV statusc (ref = HIV negative)\nPartner bisexuality (ref = not bisexual)\nPartner type (ref = not main partner)\nWoman's HIV statusc\nPartner concurrency (ref = no concurrent partners)\nPartner type (ref = not main partner)\nDiscussion\nParadoxically, perceptions among low-income mostly\nAfrican-American women that their sexual partners engage\nin high risk behaviors, such as having male partners, hav-\ning concurrent partners, or injecting drugs, or that a partner\nis HIV positive, or lack of awareness of these partner risk\nfactors, do not seem to be associated with condom use,\nparticularly when certain contextual factors are taken into\naccount. About half of the women believed their partners\nhad partners at the same time as they were partners with\nthem (partner concurrency), but perceptions of partner\nconcurrency were associated with condom use only before\ntype of partner (not a main partner v. a main partner) was\ntaken into account. After partner type was added to the\nmodel, a perception of concurrency was no longer associ-\nated with condom use and, consistent with prior studies,\nsex with a main partner was associated with greatly\ndecreased odds of using a condom. This finding not only\nreports higher rates of perceived and actual concurrency\nwomen perceived that partners had other partners and of all\nwomen who had unprotected sex with a main partner, 42%\nbelieved their partners also had other partners), but also\nsuggests that women are not likely to use condoms with\nmain partners despite perceiving that their partners have\nother partners.\nFor the other three perceptions of partner risk, a per-\nception that a partner was high risk (i.e., they were HIV\npositive, bisexual, or injected drugs) was not associated\nwith condom use. Not knowing a partner's risk status ini-\ntially was associated with condom use, but not after partner\ntype and the woman's HIV status were taken into account.\nThe association between lack of awareness of a partner's\nrisk factors and condom use prior to consideration of\npartner type may be a proxy for lack of familiarity or\ncloseness with the partner. When partner type and the\nwoman's HIV status were included, lack of awareness of a\npartner's risk factors no longer was associated with con-\ndom use. The lack of association between women's per-\nceptions of their partners' risk factors and condom use\nindicates that HIV prevention interventions must extend\nbeyond disclosure of partner risk factors and take into\naccount the dynamics that accompany sex with a main or\nclose partner.\nAlthough the finding that women are less likely to use\ncondoms with their main partners is not new or surprising\n[5, 11, 57], our finding that this behavior persists despite\nperceptions that partners may be at high risk for HIV\ntransmission emphasizes the urgent need for interventions\nto be more effective for women (and men) with their main\npartners. Although theory-based interventions have proven\neffective at increasing condom use among women [57\u00ad60],\nthey are not typically effective at changing condom use\nbehaviors between women and their main partners [57, 61].\nBecause reasons for lack of condom use with main partners\nare varied, including gender- and culture-based power\nissues such as perceived and real partner disapproval of\ncondom use [14, 62] possibly related to a fear of violence\n[10] and loss of financial support [15], lack of cultural\nsupport for women (women of color in particular) initiating\ncondom use, [62] and issues related to love, trust and\nintimacy between main partners [15, 61], interventions\nmust not only take into account culture and gender-specific\nissues, but they also must remain flexible to dyad- and\nwoman-specific factors that influence condom use and\nshould also include interventions with couples. Despite our\nfindings that suggest that perceptions of a partner's risk\nfactors do not affect condom use, it should be noted that\ninterventions with heterosexual couples [63\u00ad69]--serodis-\neffective at increasing condom use in couples. In Africa,\ncounseling and testing interventions with couples have\nlong been associated with increased condom use and\nStates, recent findings from Project Eban, a randomized\ncontrolled behavioral intervention for African American\nserodiscordant couples, suggest that a couples intervention\ncan reduce HIV risk behaviors [64]. Additional randomized\ncontrolled trials are needed to test relationship interven-\ntions with couples in which both partners are HIV negative\nbut may exhibit other risk factors, such as having concur-\nrent partners, and with very low-income couples who may\nbe involved with drugs and have less stable relationships.\nAdditional contextual variables associated with decreased\nodds of condom use in this study were homelessness, crack\nuse, and alcohol use. These findings, consistent with prior\nfactors interfere with condom use by at-risk women. That\nhomeless women are less likely to use condoms suggests that\npoor and homeless women typically face more immediate\nconcerns than the long-term risk of HIV, such as, among\nother things, finding shelter for the night and feeding their\nchildren [25, 30]. Crack and alcohol use may reduce condom\nuse due to their disinhibiting effect on risk behaviors [33, 70]\nand may also be associated with the exchange of sex for\nmoney or drugs [71, 72]. Although interventions exist that\ntake into account key factors, such as crack use, that erode\nefficacy of traditional HIV prevention approaches in pro-\nmoting condom use [58, 59], effects of such interventions\nmay not endure over time and may require ongoing booster\nsessions to reinforce them [73].\nOn a slightly more hopeful and personally responsible\nnote, women who are aware that they are HIV positive are\nover four times as likely to use a condom than women who\nbelieve they are HIV negative, suggesting that women's\nawareness of their own risk factors may be effective in\nreducing risk for HIV transmission from themselves to\nothers. However, the results for the comparison group\n(women who believe they are HIV negative) and for\nwomen who do not know their HIV status are more con-\ncerning and suggest ongoing vulnerability for at-risk\nwomen of contracting HIV. Women who think they are\nHIV negative are much less likely to use condoms than\nfinding, along with the higher likelihood that women who\nare not aware of their own HIV status will engage in\nunprotected sex and the high percentage of women who\nwere not aware of their own HIV status (40%), suggests\nthat much greater efforts must be made to deliver HIV\ntesting and more effective prevention interventions to at-\nrisk women. Although studies consistently recommend\nmore HIV testing and greater access to interventions for at-\nrisk women, outside of specifically funded projects, wide-\nspread implementation of testing and effective interven-\ntions is not yet a reality [74\u00ad78]. For example, although\nthere is evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of\ninterventions such as rapid HIV testing in medical [79\u00ad81],\ntings as well as community-based organizations such as\nhomeless shelters and public parks [85], studies suggest\nthat dissemination and implementation of rapid testing in\nthese settings is lagging behind the evidence due to\nrestrictive state policies, and administrative, organizational,\nand funding barriers [74, 76, 77]. Although it is clear that\neffective interventions exist, more emphasis must be placed\ndiffusing these interventions in order to reach women who\nare at the greatest risk for HIV.\nOur findings about the relative unimportance of per-\nceptions of partner risk behaviors and health risks in con-\ndom use among these women, the risk of HIV transmission\nto women from their main partners, and the ongoing HIV\nrisk for the large number of HIV negative women and\nwomen who do not know their HIV status, emphasize the\nneed for interventions that are relevant to the context of the\nlives of very low-income, drug-using women and the need\nOur findings confirm that HIV is still a risk for low-income\nwomen in urban areas, particularly those who are homeless\nand those who use crack and alcohol. We suggest that\nfurther action include two key elements: (1) adaptation of\nexisting culturally congruent, relationship-based HIV pre-\nvention interventions [64, 65] to address the realities of\nvery low-income, substance-using African American\nwomen and their main partners, such as less-stable rela-\ntionships and partners who may not be amenable to\nattending a couples intervention; and (2) policy-based,\nfunding, and organizational strategies for expanding dif-\nfusion of rapid HIV testing into medical, criminal justice,\nand other community-based settings.\nLimitations\nFirst, the sample is not representative of all low-income\nwomen and must be treated as a convenience sample with\nlimitations on the generalization of results. The sample also\nwas composed predominantly of drug-using women, thus\nlimiting comparison to behaviors among non-drug using\nwomen. In addition, the study did not measure all con-\ntextual variables that might influence condom use. For\nexample, we did not measure women's acceptance of\ncondoms as protective for HIV, their self-efficacy for\nnegotiating and using condoms, women's perceptions of\ntheir own power in relation to their partners, and whether\nor not the women were aware that partner factors, such as\nconcurrency and bisexuality, were risky. Limitations not-\nwithstanding, the study measured event-level sexual\nbehaviors in a sample of women at high risk for HIV due to\ntheir low-income status (i.e., lack of access to prevention\nTable 5 Final multivariate\nrandom intercept logistic\nregression model: contextual\nfactors associated with condom\nuse\na n is lower than total number\nof events due to missing data\nPartner type (ref = not a main partner)\nWoman's HIV statusc (ref = HIV negative)\nHomeless (ref = not homeless in the past year)\nWoman used alcohol during sex (ref = did not use alcohol during sex)\nWoman used crack past 30 days (ref = did not use Crack past 30 days)\nand treatment resources), their substance use and abuse,\nand their association with high-risk men.
