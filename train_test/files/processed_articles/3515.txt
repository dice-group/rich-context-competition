Dementia leads to severe cognitive problems, changes in\nmood and behavior, and changes in the relationship with the partner and members of\ntheir social network (e.g., Milano, Saturnino, & Capasso, 2013; Spalletta et al., 2010).\nThe care is often a considerable burden on persons directly involved, not just physically\nbut also emotionally and because it affects their social lives (e.g., Pe~\nna-Longobardo and\nSelf-management is therefore important both for the person with dementia and for their\nfamily caregivers in dealing with dementia and the consequences for their daily lives.\nFollowing the definition of Barlow, Wright, Sheasby, Turner, and Hainsworth (2002), we\ndefine self-management as \"the individual's ability to manage symptoms, treatment, phys-\nical and psychological consequences and life style changes inherent in living with a chron-\nic condition.\"\nHowever, self-management is far from being a matter of course for people with dementia.\nThey may need support with their self-management, for example, from health care profes-\nsionals or in the form of eHealth, in the sense of dementia-related information and/or\nsupport with the aid of computers or related technologies. Yet up till now there has not\nbeen an overview of the effectiveness of the available interventions for self-management\nsupport in people with dementia, despite of existing relevant systematic reviews. We have\ntherefore conducted a meta-review of these existing systematic reviews. However, it became\nclear during the analysis for the meta-review that it is too soon to draw conclusions on the\neffects of self-management interventions on people with dementia. Nevertheless, the meta-\nreview gives some interesting insights into the kind of interventions being used and provides\nrecommendations for future research and practice. This brief research paper presents the\nresults of the meta-review.\nMethods\nWe conducted a meta-review, in the sense of a systematic literature study of existing relevant\nsystematic reviews. We followed the PRISMA Statement for systematic reviews (Moher,\nLiberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009) wherever possible, as incorporated in a protocol drawn\nup in advance. The reviews had to deal with self-management support in dementia, in which\nthe effects were measured at the individual patient level. Table 1 summarizes the specific\ninclusion criteria.\nSearch strategy and sources\nSystematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library,\nEmbase and PsycINFO in December 2015. First, a sensitive search strategy was developed\nfor PubMed/Medline. This was then adapted for use in the other databases. All publications\nup to December 2015 were taken into consideration, regardless of the publication language.\nStudy selection\nA two-step procedure was used to identify references for inclusion. First, the titles and\nabstracts of the references that resulted from the database searches were checked to see\nwhether they satisfied the inclusion criteria. One reviewer (JGH) screened all the references.\nThe second reviewer (ALF) then independently screened a 10% random selection. The first\nreviewer proceeded individually if the level of agreement (Kappa) was 0.60. If enough\ninformation could not be obtained from the title and abstract, those references were taken to\nthe next step of the selection process. In this second step, the full texts of the references\nselected in the first step (including the references with insufficient information in the title and\nabstract) were independently screened by the two reviewers. A third reviewer (RV) was\nconsulted if the first and second reviewer did not agree.\nMethodological assessment\nAfter the second selection step (see before), the methodological quality of the reviews was\ndetermined with the Quality Assessment Checklist for Reviews developed by Oxman and\nGuyatt (1991). Reviews with a score of 2 or less were considered to be of \"low quality\" and\nwere subsequently excluded.\nTable 1. Inclusion criteria for the meta-review.\nEligibility criteria\nTypes of study. Systematic reviews that met the following criteria: (a) the review included a description of\nsearch terms, (b) searches were conducted in Medline or PubMed and at least one other international\nscientific database, and (c) the review included effect studies (RCT, CCT, or quasi experimental designs).\nTypes of participant. People with dementia, or dyads of primary caregivers and people with dementia, living in\nthe community.\nTypes of intervention. The systematic reviews had to focus on professional self-management support inter-\nventions. These interventions had to explicitly be geared to helping the person with dementia cope with\nthe dementia and its effects on their day-to-day lives. Additionally, there had to be personal contact\nbetween the person with dementia and the health care professional. The review had to describe and\nanalyze the effects of self-management support interventions, and to draw an overall conclusion about the\ninterventions' effectiveness. Cognitive training was not deemed a self-management support intervention.\nTypes of outcome measure. Only systematic reviews discussing effects on persons with dementia\nwere included.\nHuis in het Veld et al. 3\nResults\nThe flow chart in Figure 1 shows the number of studies assessed, excluded, and included at\neach stage of the selection process.\nIn the end, seven reviews were found that satisfied all the inclusion criteria (Cooper et al.,\nhave \"major flaws,\" based on a quality score of 3.0 (Corbett et al., 2012). Three reviews\nLeven et al., 2013) reflecting \"minor flaws.\" Three reviews received a quality score of 7.0\nindicating that they met all quality requirements of the Quality Assessment Checklist for\nkey features of these seven reviews.\nTitles idenfied from\ndatabase searches\nAbstracts aer\nremoving duplicates\nFull text references\nassessed for eligibility\nArcles excluded based on tle/abstract n= 4672\nStudies included\nNo systemac review (n=23)\nReferences not focusing on demena (n=14)\nNo SMS intervenons included (n=49)\nPapers not obtained (n=21)\nFull text references\nassessed for quality\nReferences excluded because of low quality n =6\nFigure 1.

However, if the above-mentioned definition based on Barlow et al. (2002) is\napplied, the selected reviews do indeed consider interventions in which self-management was\na central component. Table 3 shows the elements that comprised the self-management sup-\nport interventions we identified. Self-management support was often aimed at dealing with\nproblems affecting the psychological well-being of the person with dementia. The table also\nshows that self-management is often combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or\ncoping interventions.\nProfessionals and a focus on managing psychological problems. The interventions were primarily\nperformed by psychologists, occupational therapists, and psychiatrists. Nursing staff were\nonly explicitly mentioned as professionals providing self-management interventions in two\nof the seven reviews (Reilly et al., 2015; van't Leven et al., 2013). The interventions focused\nprimarily on managing psychological problems, for example, depression or anxiety. In addi-\ntion, improvement of quality of life in general and/or postponing admission to a nursing\nhome was often an important aim of the interventions.\nEffects. The seven systematic reviews that were included show effects for a number of out-\ncome variables in the person with dementia, for example, depression (Orgeta et al., 2015)\nand the time to admission to a nursing home (Reilly et al., 2015). However, it was not\npossible to draw conclusions from this about the effects of self-management support on\npeople with dementia. There are two key reasons for this.\nIn the first place, self-management support interventions often include other components\nas well. A clear example of such a combined intervention can be seen in the study by\nBurgener, Yang, Gilbert, and Marsh-Yant (2008), included in the systematic review by\nOrgeta et al. (2015). Burgener et al. studied the effects of a support group in which\npeople with dementia learned how to resolve problems in their day-to-day lives, which\ncan be considered as a self-management intervention. However, this was combined with\ntai chi exercises and CBT (Burgener et al., 2008). The combination of interventions meant\nthat the individual effects of the self-management components could not be distin-\nguished properly.\nThe second reason was that four of the seven systematic reviews included studies of self-\nmanagement support interventions, but did not analyze them separately from studies of\nother kinds of interventions. The review by Cooper et al. (2012) is one such example. It\nincluded a study by Logsdon et al. (2010). Logsdon et al. researched the effects of a self-\nmanagement support intervention in which discussion groups of people with dementia and\ntheir family caregivers talked together about how to deal with how dementia impacts social\nand family relationships and about making plans for the future. In this review, the effects of\nthis self-management support intervention were analyzed together with those of cognitive\nstimulation therapies that did not include any self-management support components\n(Chapman, Weiner, Rackley, Hynan, & Zientz, 2004; Davis, Massman, & Doody, 2001;\nHuis in het Veld et al. 13\nDiscussion\nDespite the fact that the reviews we examined showed positive effects, it is not possible at\nthis point to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of self-management support inter-\nventions on people with dementia. A main reason for this is that the self-management\nsupport interventions that were studied were often combined with other kinds of interven-\ntions such as CBT.\nBy excluding reviews with low methodological quality (score of 2 or less), we reduced the\nrisk of biased conclusions. Seven of the eight reviews included received a quality score of 4\nor more indicating either minor or no flaws, which is also important for providing unbiased,\nvalid results.\nHowever, a limitation was that the reviews did not label the interventions as \"self-man-\nagement support interventions.\" Guided by the explicit inclusion criterion that\n\"interventions had to explicitly be geared to helping the person with dementia cope with the\ndementia and its effects on their day-to-day lives and there had to be personal contact between\nthe person with dementia and the healthcare professional,\" we decided whether interventions\nconcerned self-management support. This decision implied subjective judgments.\nThis meta-review also teaches us that existing self-management support interventions\n(even if they are not always explicitly denoted as such) focus almost exclusively on the\npsychological well-being of the person with dementia. Self-management support interven-\ntions should however be wider in scope. In addition to psychological well-being, the\n\"relationship with relatives,\" \"maintaining an active lifestyle,\" \"techniques to cope with\nmemory change,\" and \"information\" are also important objectives for self-management\nsupport interventions (Martin, Turner, Wallace, & Bradbury, 2013). Future interventions\nshould include one or more of these objectives as well in order to provide the best possible\nsupport for self-management by people with dementia and those around them.\nAccordingly, different outcome measures linked to the above-mentioned objectives\nshould be used in future research on the effectiveness of self-management support inter-\nventions for people with dementia. Examples are outcome measures that indicate \"the qual-\nity of the relationship with family caregivers,\" \"the number of social contacts,\" or\n\"knowledge about dementia.\"\nHence, future research is needed on the effects of self-management support interventions\non patients. At the moment, more information is available regarding the effects on relatives.\nA previous meta-review (Huis in het Veld, Verkaik, Mistiaen, van Meijel, & Francke, 2015)\ndescribed effects of self-management support on informal caregivers of people with demen-\ntia, for example, an increase of well-being, stress relieve and more quality of life. However,\nin current health care in which patients themselves are also expected to execute self-\nmanagement, it is important to further investigate which kinds of self-management support\ninterventions are effective in particularly people with dementia and which are not.\nThe meta-review also revealed that self-management support is often provided by psy-\nchologists, occupational therapists, and other therapists. It is striking that nurses were only\nmentioned in two of the seven reviews, since self-management support fits with a core\ncompetency of nurses, namely acting as an information and education resource for clients\nseeking to improve life styles, and who have to cope with changes in health and disability\nand death (ICN, 2008). Nurses are often in closer contact with the person with dementia\nthan psychologists and occupational therapists, for example, and they accordingly see self-\nmanagement support as part of their job (Verkaik, van Antwerpen-Hoogenraad, de Veer,\nFrancke, & Huis in het Veld, 2016). Nursing professionals can incorporate self-management\nsupport in the regular care that they deliver to people with dementia.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This study forms part of the research program \"NurseSMS--Nurses Self-\nmanagement Support for people facing progressive incurable diseases\" (2014\u00ad2019), which is funded\nby ZonMw; The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development, Program \"Tussen\nWeten en Doen.\"\nReferences\nBarlow, J., Wright, C., Sheasby, J., Turner, A., & Hainsworth, J.
