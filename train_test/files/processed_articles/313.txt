From a clinical perspective, it is important to\nidentify treatable risk factors associated with early pro-\ngression in the course of the disease. Several factors that\npredict a more rapid deterioration of renal function include\nage, male gender, gross hematuria, proteinuria, type 1\ngene mutations on chromosome 16 compared with type 2\nmutations on chromosome 4, renal cyst volume, hyperten-\nsion, increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and\nAfrican American ethnicity.5\u00ad9\nOf these risk factors for renal dysfunction in ADPKD,\nhypertension is the only treatable condition identified to\ndate. Moreover, hypertension in patients with ADPKD is\nassociated with a high incidence of left ventricular hyper-\nFrom the Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of\nMedicine (CLK, KKM, AMJ, RWS) and the Denver Health Medical\nCenter (CLK), Denver, Colorado.\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Na-\ntional Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD); grants MO1 RR00051 and\nthe National Center for Research Resources, National Institutes of\nHealth; and the Zell Family Foundation, Two North Riverside Plaza,\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. Robert W.\nSchrier, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 4200 East Ninth\n\u00a9 2004 by the American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.\ntrophy.10 Left ventricular hypertrophy is a known risk\nfactor for cardiovascular complications, which are now the\nmost common cause of death in patients with ADPKD.11\nStudies of hypertension in patients with ADPKD have\nimplicated increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldo-\nsterone system (RAAS).12\u00ad14 A prospective randomized\nstudy showed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors re-\nversed left ventricular hypertrophy to a greater extent than\ncalcium channel blockers in patients with ADPKD.15 More-\nover, in the same study, aggressive control of blood pressure\n(BP) (120/80 mm Hg) in patients with ADPKD was asso-\nciated with reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy to a\n90 mm Hg).15 The recent improvement in BP control in\npatients with ADPKD16 is associated with a later onset of\nESRD in both men and women with ADPKD.17\nTherefore, early identification of individuals with AD-\nPKD is imperative to allow aggressive treatment of hy-\npertension. Although family history is helpful in\nidentifying affected individuals, on questioning only 60%\nof patients with ADPKD reveal a positive family history.18\nIn this article, we explore the specific characteristics of\nhypertension in young patients with ADPKD as compared\nwith hypertension in young individuals in the general U.S.\npopulation. With the recent availability of the fourth\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES IV), the epidemiology of hypertension in the\nUnited States is accessible and current. With the goal of\nearly diagnosis, the purpose of the present study was to\nanalyze the incidence of hypertension in patients with\nADPKD versus hypertension in the U.S. population, par-\nticularly between the ages of 20 and 34 years.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nand children with ADPKD without ESRD participated in a\nlongitudinal study at the University of Colorado Health\nSciences Center to define the natural history of ADPKD.\nAll protocols were approved by the Colorado Multiple\nInstitutional Review Board, and all subjects provided writ-\nfollowing inclusion criteria for analysis: 1) one full exam-\nination at the University of Colorado General Clinical\nResearch Center (GCRC), 2) a normal serum creatinine\nconcentration (1.2 mg/dL for women; 1.5 mg/dL for\nmen), 3) a normal dipstick protein (0 or trace; 11 subjects\nmissing dipstick data but with urinary protein excretion\n5) not of the African American ethnicity, and 6) subjects\nwere not in another hypertension treatment study. Of the\nfamily in the study and the other 393 patients had an\nADPKD relative in the study. The data analyzed were\nfrom the subjects' first study visit and reflect care before\nstudy participation.\nA complete medical history and physical examination\nwere performed at the initial study visit to the GCRC.\nBlood pressures were measured by trained nurses using a\nDinamap apparatus (Critikon Inc., Tampa, FL). In adults,\nhypertension was defined as mean systolic BP 140 mm\nHg or mean diastolic BP 90 mm Hg while sitting or on\nantihypertensive medication with a previous diagnosis of\nhypertension. In children (18 years), hypertension was\ndefined as greater than 50% of measured systolic or dia-\nstolic BPs above the 95th percentile for age-, gender-, and\nheight-matched children.19\nLaboratory data obtained at this initial GCRC visit\nincluded routine serum chemistries and two 24-h urine\ncollections to measure protein excretion. Urinary protein\nconcentrations were determined by the Coumassie blue\ndye-binding method. The mean of the two collections was\nused to assess each individual's level of proteinuria (in\nmilligrams per 24 hours).\nData from patients with ADPKD (ages newborn to 55\nsubjects). The NHANES data were obtained from four\nsources: 1) a table published by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention,20 2) published analysis of\nNHANES data,21 and 3) raw data files from NHANES III\nand NHANES IV made available to the public.22,23 The\n1987 were included in the ADPKD data to have sufficient\nsample size for comparison. Similarly, the NHANES IV\ndren (aged newborn to 19 years) could only be compared\nwith the NHANES IV data, as the NHANES III data were\nincomplete for children. Similarly, NHANES IV data were\nused for comparisons of BP control and treatment, as these\ndata were not available in NHANES III. The NHANES\nstudies include subjects with secondary hypertension, but\npresumably 90% to 95% of the subjects have essential\nhypertension.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe 2 test of independence was used to identify gender\ndifferences regarding the prevalence and treatment of hy-\npertension among patients with ADPKD. Continuous vari-\nables were compared with Student t test. Because\nsignificant gender differences were identified, all subse-\nquent analyses were performed separately for male and\nfemale subjects. The 2 tests of independence were per-\nformed to compare the ADPKD patients with the general\nU.S. population (NHANES data) with regard to differ-\nences in the percentage with hypertension, the percentage\nwith BP controlled at or below 140/90 mm Hg, and the\npercentage receiving treatment for hypertension. Results\nwere considered significant at the .05 level.\nResults\nComparison of ADPKD Male\nand Female Patients\nFive hundred sixteen subjects with ADPKD were included\n7% of the subjects were documented to have been\nscreened for ADPKD because of hypertension; the reason\nfor the ADPKD diagnosis was unknown in 28%. Of the\nhypertension or were hypertensive at the time of the study\nand 123 did not. Inclusion of this information did not alter\nthe conclusions of the study. A significantly higher per-\ncentage of ADPKD males than females were hypertensive\n(Fig. 1), with greater gender differences noted between the\nages of 20 and 44 years. Because of these differences,\nsubsequent analyses were separated by gender.\nPrevalence of Hypertension in ADPKD\nSubjects Versus the U.S. Population\nThe prevalence of hypertension in subjects with ADPKD\nin our database was compared with the prevalence of\nhypertension in the white U.S. population as reported in\nthe NHANES studies for two time periods. The first period\nis depicted in Fig. 2. Dramatic differences are shown in the\nprevalence of hypertension in male and female subjects\nwith ADPKD compared with male and female individuals\nin the general white U.S. population for all age groups.\nThe more recent results are depicted in Fig. 3. Differences\nare seen in each group under the age of 45 years, but the\nmost dramatic differences are seen in the 20- to 34-year\nage group.\nTable 1.

A greater\npercentage of both male and female ADPKD patients were\nreceiving antihypertensive treatment; however, this differ-\nence was significant only in women.\nDiscussion\nHypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor affect-\npolycystic kidney disease is associated with hypertension\nin a large percentage of cases.25 At present, with the\navailability of renal replacement therapy (dialysis and\nrenal transplantation), the major cause of death in patients\nwith ADPKD is cardiovascular events.11 The observation\nthat nearly 50% of hypertensive ADPKD subjects (mean\nage 41 years) exhibit left ventricular hypertrophy10 sug-\ngests that untreated hypertension has been present for a\nconsiderable time. This is not unexpected given that hy-\npertension occurs early in ADPKD and precedes any de-\nmm Hg) in patients with ADPKD more effectively re-\nverses left ventricular hypertrophy than standard BP con-\ntrol.15 Moreover, improvement in BP control and the use\nof angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been\nassociated with later onset of ESRD in both male and\nfemale subjects with ADPKD.17\nUnexplained hypertension in young individuals be-\ntween the ages of 20 to 34 years generally leads to a\nworkup for secondary causes of hypertension, as recom-\nmended by the Joint National Committee on Prevention,\nDetection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-\nsure (JNC) VII.26 A normal serum creatinine, absence of\nproteinuria by dipstick, and clear urinary sediment are\nmeasured to exclude renal parenchymal disease. However,\nthese criteria would miss the diagnosis of ADPKD in\nyoung individuals where hypertension occurs before pro-\nteinuria or a decrease in renal function.\nBecause ADPKD has an autosomal dominant pattern of\ninheritance, one parent usually has the disease. However,\non questioning, 40% of ADPKD patients do not have a\nfamily history compatible with ADPKD.18 This may occur\nbecause the disease is mild in other affected family mem-\nbers and they did not develop symptoms to prompt a\ndiagnostic evaluation. It may also occur because the pa-\nFIG. 3.

Only renal imaging has been shown to be spe-\ncific and sensitive for the diagnosis of ADPKD in young\nindividuals.27,28 The diagnosis of ADPKD in individuals\nless than 30 years old is made by either the presence of\ntwo cysts (unilateral or bilateral) together with a positive\nfamily history for ADPKD or the presence of five cysts\nbilaterally in the absence of a family history of ADPKD.\nIn addressing this important issue, the results of the\npresent study were analyzed separately for men and\nwomen because of the greater predilection of hypertension\nin men as compared to premenopausal women. The results\npatients with ADPKD clearly demonstrate that the inci-\ndence of hypertension between the ages of 20 and 34 years\nis 49% in the ADPKD population versus approximately\n7% in the general U.S. population. The challenge is to\nidentify ADPKD in young hypertensive individuals with-\nout a known family history and during a period when these\nindividuals often have normal renal function and a normal\nurinalysis.\nThe present results also show that BP control (140/90\nmm Hg) in patients with ADPKD is improved compared\nwith BP control in the general U.S. hypertensive popula-\ntion. The educational approaches in place for ADPKD\npatients may account for this difference.16 The percentage\nof patients receiving antihypertensive medications was\ngreater in patients with ADPKD than in the NHANES IV\nsubjects (although only significantly different for women).\nHowever, treatment patterns probably do not completely\nexplain the difference in control. Because the RAAS is\nactivated in patients with ADPKD more than in patients\nwith essential hypertension,13 the recent increased use of\ninhibitors of the RAAS may contribute to improved BP\ncontrol in patients with ADPKD.16\nAfrican American subjects were excluded from the\npresent study because too few African American subjects\nwith ADPKD were enrolled to generate data for a separate\ncomparison with the NHANES data. Autosomal dominant\npolycystic kidney disease, however, does affect African\nAmericans5 and more studies in this population are nec-\nessary.\nScreening young hypertensive patients for ADPKD\n(34 years of age) who have a standard negative workup\nfor other common secondary causes of hypertension, in-\ncluding other renal parenchymal diseases, primary hyper-\naldosteronism, and renal vascular disease, with a renal\nultrasound would add approximately $300 to the costs.\nAlthough ESRD due to ADPKD is estimated to cost $1.8\nbillion per year, an analysis of cost savings must await\ndocumentation of an effective therapy to decrease or pre-\nvent ESRD related to ADPKD. However, some patients\nwant to know whether they have a genetic disease because\nit makes a difference in their decision making regarding\nhealth care and family planning. On the other hand, some\nindividuals may not want to know because of insurance\neligibility issues. Given the increased incidence of cerebral\naneurysms,29 the diagnosis of ADPKD may also affect the\nphysician's response to neurological complaints. Early\ndiagnosis and aggressive treatment of hypertension offers\nthe potential to prevent development of left ventricular\nhypertrophy and cardiovascular complications in patients\nwith ADPKD.6,10 Although hypertension in patients with\nADPKD correlates with increased renal volumes and more\nrapid progression to ESRD, there is a need for an ade-\nquately powered, prospective randomized study to evalu-\nate whether aggressive lowering of BP and blockade of the\nRAAS will slow the progression of the renal disease. The\nNational Institutes of Health is supporting a 5-year multi-\ncenter prospective randomized clinical trial (HALT poly-\ncystic kidney disease) that will involve 1250 patients with\nADPKD. The hypothesis is that inhibition of the RAAS\nwith a combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme\ninhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker will be more\neffective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\nalone. The Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)\nstudy, which had a 2.2-year average follow-up, included\n200 patients with ADPKD but did not randomize the\npatients in relation to their antihypertensive medications.30\nNo improvement in renal function was observed with\nmore aggressive BP control but the study may have been\nunderpowered.\nIn summary, the results of the present study indicate\nthat when the diagnostic workup for a secondary cause of\nhypertension in patients between the ages of 20 and 34\nyears is negative, even in the presence of a normal serum\ncreatinine and urinalysis and a negative family history, the\nphysician still should consider the possibility of ADPKD.\nThis diagnosis can be confirmed in nearly 100% of pa-\ntients with ADPKD by age 30 years with a renal ultra-\nsound. The potential prevention of cardiovascular\ncomplications by early intervention with blockade of the\ndecrease morbidity and mortality. Although uncontrolled\nhypertension may accelerate progression of most renal\ndiseases, the role of aggressive BP control and blockade of\nthe RAAS in the renal progression of ADPKD must await\nthe HALT PKD results.\nReferences\n1.
