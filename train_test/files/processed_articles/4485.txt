This article uses a\nunique, complete Twitter dataset of tweets including the word \"Syria\" in English or Arabic to empirically test how Syria's\nconflict was discussed online. The analysis shows a high level of interaction between Syria and other Arab countries\nthrough 2011. Other Arab countries experiencing popular protests (\"Arab Spring countries\") were referenced far more\noften in 2011 than were Syria's immediate neighbors, while keyword analysis shows the framing of the conflict in terms\nof Syria's \"regime\" aligned the conflict with other Arab uprisings. In 2012\u00ad2013 this changed sharply, with significantly\nfewer mentions of other Arab countries, particularly Arab Spring countries, more fundraising and political appeals across\nthe Gulf, and growing Islamization. These findings offer one of the first empirical demonstrations of the integration and\ndisintegration of a unified Arab discourse from 2011 to 2013, with significant implications for theories of the diffusion of\nprotest and ideas.\n",

These protests\ninvolved a remarkable number of commonalities in slo-\ngans, timing, and methods, and self-conscious framing of\nevents as a common \"Arab\" narrative. Yemeni protestors,\nfor instance, quickly adopted Egyptian slogans or took\nheart from Libyan opposition advances. This Arab uprising\nrepresents a critical case for theories of the international\ndiffusion of protest movements and regime change (Bunce\nThe early Syrian uprising modeled itself after counterparts\nacross the region, employing similar rhetorical frames,\nattempting to seize public places without arms, presenting a\ncivic, non-sectarian and non-Islamist face at home and abroad,\nand in some cases hoping to attract a NATO intervention like\nLibya's. Many likely expected Bashar al-Asad's regime to\nsuccumb to a similar fate as those of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak\nand Tunisia's Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali (Anden-Papadopolous\n2012).As Syria's conflict evolved towards a mixture of protest\nand civil war, while uprisings in Arab Spring leaders such as\nTunisia, Egypt, and Yemen themselves struggled, Syria\nbecame far more of a polarizing issue with a higher degree of\nsectarian rather than pan-Arab identity narratives.\nHow did Syria's popular uprising of 2011 fit within the\nbroader regional wave of Arab uprisings in early 2011,\ncommonly termed the \"Arab Spring\"? Existing theories of\nprotest diffusion and regime change cascades emphasize\nthe importance of geographic proximity. The pattern of\nuprisings in Arab countries in early 2011 only partially fits\nSyria in the Arab Spring: The integration\nof Syria's conflict with the Arab uprisings,\nMarc Lynch1, Deen Freelon2 and Sean Aday1\n Keywords\nArab uprising, diffusion, social media, Syria\n1The George Washington University, USA\n2American University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMarc Lynch, The George Washington University, 1957 E St, NW,\nEmail: marclynchgwu@gmail.com\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nthese models, however. While Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya\nmay be physically connected, they are far from Yemen,\nBahrain, and Syria. The regional nature of the Arab upris-\nings has been explained in part by the unusually intense\ndegree of transnational linkages and a highly unified Arab\npublic sphere, which facilitated diffusion of ideas, meth-\nods, and actions from one country to the next (Lynch, 2011,\n2012). That shared space facilitated the spread of expecta-\ntions of the possibility of victory, the sharing of repertoires\nof contention such as the tactic of seizing and holding a\ncentral square, and the replication of slogans such as \"the\npeople demand the downfall of the regime.\"\nCurrent theories of international diffusion have not fully\nconsidered the differences between the Arab uprisings and\nprevious regional waves of protest, while most accounts of\nthe Arab uprisings have simply assumed Syria's place\nwithin this broadly integrated, intensely interconnected\nArab public sphere. This article uses a unique Twitter data-\nset of all tweets over 2 months that include the word \"Syria\"\nin Arabic or English, to present new empirical evidence\nboth for theories of international diffusion and for prevalent\nexplanations of Syria's conflict and the broader Arab\nuprising.\nThe findings suggest that Syria was deeply embedded\nwithin a relatively integrated Arab public sphere during\nmost of 2011. For the first six months of the conflict,\n35\u00ad45% of the tweets that mention Syria also mention at\nleast one other Arab country and 10\u00ad15% mention more\nthan one. What is more, attention in these early days\nreflected shared experience of protest far more than it did\ngeographic proximity. Countries undergoing their own\nprotest movements were far more likely to be mentioned\nin this early phase than were countries close to Syria or\nregionally powerful countries such as Saudi Arabia and\nQatar. In 2012, this changed dramatically, online and on\nthe ground. Far fewer Syria tweets mentioned other Arab\ncountries, with those that did more likely to mention\nneighbors immediately affected by the fighting. As peace-\nful protest gave way to insurgency and civil war, Syria\nbecame less \"Arab springy\" and more of a sectarian,\ntransnational civil war with primary impact on its geo-\ngraphical neighbors.\nThis evidence challenges and expands upon recent argu-\nments about the socially constructed nature of \"diffusion\"\n2013). Where earlier literature highlights the importance of\ngeographic proximity in regime change cascades and pro-\ntest diffusion, Arab Spring cases such as Tunisia, Libya,\nEgypt, Yemen, and Bahrain were physically distant from\nArab countries which occupied the same discursive space\nas Syria in 2011, and from which Syrian activists borrowed\nprotest slogans and methods, were neither its neighbors nor\ntraditional allies or rivals, but rather other Arab countries\nexperiencing large-scale protest. Geographical proximity\nstill matters, of course, but so do socially-constructed iden-\ntities framed within distinctive public sphere networks.\nDiffusion and identity framing\nThe high degree of regional media and social media inte-\ngration arguably helped to create the conditions for the\ninternational diffusion of revolutionary protest, culminating\nin a regime change cascade (Hale, 2013; Hussain and\nmechanism explored here is scale shift, the linking together\nof disparate local struggles into a single master frame which\nallows protest forms to become \"modular\" (Beissinger\nferent contexts. We address the prior question: to what\nextent was there such a common media and publicly articu-\nlated shared identity in the first place?\nEvidence that Syria's protestors paid close attention to\nphysically distant Arab uprisings has implications for\ntheories of diffusion beyond the Middle East. A tightly\ninterlinked media environment would help to explain the\nparticular potency of demonstration effects in the early\nArab uprisings. The articulation of a shared identity\nwithin that media is also important, however, as individu-\nals will more likely be inspired by protests in a foreign\nland if they have bought in to the notion that protestors\nthere were \"just like me\" and engaged in a shared strug-\ngle (Lohmann, 1994). As Beissinger puts it, \"modular\nphenomena are made possible by a sense of interconnect-\nedness across cases produced by common institutional\ncharacteristics, histories, cultural affinities, or modes of\ndomination, allowing agents to make analogies across\ncases and to read relevance into developments in other\nof multiple countries in a tweet is a concrete manifesta-\ntion of this construction of a shared identity and shifting\nof scale. When individuals tweet \"injustice is injustice\nwhether in Bahrain or Libya or Syria\" (@salmaeldaly,\nMarch 2011) or \"#daraa of #syria is #sidibouzid of #tuni-\nsia and #suez of #egypt\" (@drsonnet, March 2011), they\nare explicitly constructing such a sense of shared struggle\nand shared fate.\nThe construction of identity in terms of a shared popular\nuprising rather than physical proximity or political similar-\nity points to the importance of problematizing the defini-\ntion of \"proximity\" for the purposes of studying diffusion\nthe early Arab Spring, Egypt and Tunisia were \"closer\" to\nSyria than were its immediate neighbors because of the\nshared experience of a popular uprising. In 2012 Kuwait\nbecame \"closer\" to Syria through the mobilization of public\nsupport in Kuwaiti civil society, and in 2013 Iraq became\n\"closer\" not because the physical distance between the two\ncountries had changed but because its insurgency fused\nwith parts of the Syrian insurgency. Our analysis of tweets\nLynch et al. 3\noffers one empirically observable manifestation of these\nchanges.\nMethodology\nSocial media has been used increasingly as a source of data\nfor examining questions such as these (Bruns et al., 2013;\nTufekci, 2014). The high volume of real time sharing of\ninformation and expression of personal opinions creates an\nunprecedented public archive. The Syrian conflict has been\nperhaps the most socially-mediated civil war in history,\nwith little direct journalistic access to the battlefield and an\nextraordinary amount of user-generated content shared\nacross social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter\n(Lynch et al., 2014). These tweets do many things simulta-\nneously: they share information and frame it within a par-\nticular narrative context through self-selected networks,\nthey can be used to condemn or praise, to express solidarity,\nand to argue and disrupt ongoing conversations (Tufekci,\n2014). In this paper we are primarily interested in using\nlarge-scale analysis of these tweets as a window into public\ndiscourse.\nOur analysis is based on a complete dataset of every\ntweet including the word \"Syria\" in Arabic or English\npurchased from the certified Twitter data vendor, Topsy,\nincludes all public tweets posted in those months \u00ad totaling\nover 5 million tweets and almost 7 million unique users. We\navoided using hashtags or selecting key users in construct-\ning this dataset in order to avoid the inevitable distortions\nof selecting on a dependent variable (Tufekci, 2014). It is\nworth noting that the use of \"Syria\" likely means that tweets\nfrom inside Syria itself are underrepresented (i.e. in a long\ndebate about a protest in Aleppo, the word Syria might not\nbe used).\nOur analysis includes all tweets that were re-tweeted at\nleast five times, in order to focus on tweets which passed a\nminimum threshold of attention. We further focused the\nanalysis by drawing tweets from a subset of the dataset's\nlargest densely-connected network communities. We did\nthis to increase the possibility that the tweets we examined\nwould come from, and be raised to prominence by, indi-\nviduals with a vested interest in Syria and its affairs. This\nWe then extracted every mention in Arabic and English\nof 14 different Arab countries which appeared in a tweet\ncontaining Syria. We calculated how many tweets each\nmonth contained one, two, three, four, or more other Arab\ncountries, and how frequently those tweets were re-tweeted.\nThis gives us an index of \"Arab Springness\" which tells us\nthe extent to which tweets on Syria were linked to countries\noutside its borders. We posit that higher numbers of tweets\ncontaining one or more other Arab countries in addition to\nSyria represent higher degrees of regional interconnection\nand shared identification, which in turn are conducive to\nscale shift and diffusion across borders.\nWhich countries were mentioned alongside Syria mat-\nters as much as does the volume of co-mentions. We there-\nfore grouped the 14 Arab countries into baskets of similar\nstates. First, we created a basket of the five \"Arab Spring\"\nstates in which a major protest movement took place\nbetween January and March 2011: Bahrain, Egypt, Libya,\nTunisia, and Yemen. None of these countries have particu-\nlarly close economic, political, or cultural relations with\nSyria, and none directly neighbor it. They are in physically\ndifferent parts of the Middle East, have different levels of\nwealth, different political systems, and different sectarian\ncompositions. The only thing which unites these five coun-\ntries is that they experienced a major uprising in this time\nframe which overthrew or came close to overthrowing an\nentrenched autocratic regime.\nWe also broke out a group of Syria's neighbors.\nConveniently for the purposes of analysis, none of these\nneighbors (Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon) experienced a major pro-\ntest movement, but each had close political, demographic,\nand cultural interactions with Syria. The dataset also\nincludes Morocco, a distant Arab country which did not\nhave a major \"Arab Spring\" uprising, and Oman, a Gulf\nstate which did not play a major role in Syria. Neither\nreceives any appreciable level of attention, which provides\na useful validity check on the assumed significance of the\nTwitter mentions. Finally, we included Palestine, which did\nnot have major mobilization and was only marginally\naffected by the war during the time period covered here, but\nwhich traditionally occupies a central place in Arab politi-\ncal discourse and would \u00ad all else equal \u00ad be expected to\nfigure prominently in any regional discussion.\nWe coded the incidence of several key words in English\nand Arabic within the top 5,000 most re-tweeted tweets each\nmonth as a proxy for the prevalence of particular identity\nframes (Petchler and Gonzalez-Bailon, 2014). We employed\na simple lexicon approach, searching in English and Arabic\nfor the terms \"regime\" (a term often used by those sympa-\nthetic with the Syrian opposition, which resonates well with\nthe discourse of the otherArab uprising cases), \"donate/dona-\ntion\" (a term which we determined inductively captures a\nwide swathe of the public fundraising efforts on behalf of the\nSyrian opposition), and \"jihad\" (a term which captures at\nleast some of the Islamist framing of the conflict).\nFindings\nThe data demonstrate clearly a high degree of \"Arab\nSpringness\" during the six months following the outbreak\nof Syria's uprising in March 2011, and the sharp decline of\nthat integration in the following 18 months.\n4 Research and Politics \nincluded at least one other Arab country (and 32% of all\nre-tweets), while 8% of unique tweets and of all re-tweets\nnamed two or more (see Figure 1). In August 2011, when\nthe overall number of tweets containing the word \"Syria\" in\nEnglish or Arabic nearly quadrupled from the previous\nmonth, this shot up to 37% naming at least one other Arab\ncountry and 12% naming at least two. This \"Arab\nSpringness\" reached a peak of 41.5% naming one country\ntries named were not randomly selected. Figure 2 shows\nthat the five \"Arab Spring\" countries dominated the men-\ntions during 2011, with Arab spring countries appearing in\nno fewer than 20% of all tweets in any month. That\nexceeded 30% in each month between August and\nNovember 2011. By contrast, Syria's immediate neighbors\nFigure 1. Total percentage of tweets with one or two other Arab countries.\nFigure 2. Mentions of all \"Arab Spring\" countries as percentage of all tweets.\nLynch et al. 5\ndid not appear in more than 5% of tweets in any month in\nthis time period except for September, when the proportion\nOur analysis of keywords also matches this pattern. As\nFigure 3 demonstrates, the tweets in this period sharply\nfocused on the \"regime.\" The \"regime\" frame consciously\nmirrors the communicative strategy and framing of opposi-\ntions across the Arab world. \"The people want to overthrow\nthe regime\" was the definitive slogan of the early Arab\nuprisings, shouted from Tunis to Cairo to Sanaa. Tweets\nsuch as \"these leaders in libya, syria and yemen didn't learn\nthe lesson: if your people's blood has flown your end is\nnear!\" by Egyptian businessman @naguibsawiris (April\n2011, in English) or \"Libya, Yemen, Syria ... all deserve\njustice and security together ... and all the Muslim lands\"\nby Saudi media figure @ahmadalshugairi (April 2011, in\nArabic) were common. Opposition activists tried to keep a\ntight focus on the depredations and illegitimacy of the\nregime while sustaining the momentum towards an inevita-\nble denouement of regime change. \"Jihad\" barely appears\nat all during 2011, in line with the framing of the struggle as\na civic uprising against an autocratic regime.\nSyria's \"Arab Springness\" did not last, however.\nFigures 1, 2, and 3 collectively show how \"Arab\nSpringness\" declined as the Syrian struggle evolved from\na civic uprising into civil war and insurgency.\n\"One\" hovers around 20% of all tweets, still a respectable\nfigure which suggests a continuing high level of bilateral\nengagement with Syria. The switch from \"Arab Spring\"\ncountries to \"Neighbors\" (Figure 2) further reveals this\nshift. After January 2012, \"Arab Spring\" never breaks\n10%, while \"Neighbors\" does so multiple times. The\ndecline in \"Arab Springness\" coincides with the sharp\nincrease in violence in the country and the growing shift\ntowards armed resistance. The \"regime\" framing preferred\nby the mainstream Syrian opposition did not disappear, but\nit did fall in salience compared to sectarian and religious\nidentity framing.\nThe tweets in the first eight months of 2012 reveal a\nmajor spike in the mention of \"donations,\" the keyword we\nchose as a proxy for the massive public fundraising and\npolitical support campaigns which gained steam across the\nGulf in this period. The shift towards \"donations\" reflects\nthe shift in focus by outside communities, and their grow-\ning role in funding and supporting armed groups rather\nthan simply sharing information and expressing support.\nTweets by prominent religious personalities such as @\nnabilalawadhy, @tareqsuwaidan, and @salman_odah\nbemoaning the fate of fellow Muslims and offering details\non phone numbers, locations, and times for charitable\ncampaigns commonly received thousands of re-tweets.\nThese campaigns were often tied to specific Syrian fac-\ntions and fighting groups, creating organic links between\ngeographically distant parts of the Middle East. This was a\nvery different type of identity construction, however:\ninstead of identifying with the process of uprising and non-\nviolent regime change, online strategies now identified\nwith sectarian identities and particular groups within the\ncomplex insurgency.\nBy 2013, \"jihad\" grew rapidly in prevalence, reflecting\nthe increasingly Islamized and radicalized nature of the\nSyria discourse. The dramatic spike over the summer of\n2013 in Figure 3 matches the overall shift in tenor in\nregional discourse on the conflict. The rise of powerful\ngroups such as Jubhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq\nand al-Sham (ISIS) depended heavily on funding and fight-\ners from outside of Syria. Tweets including appeals for\nMuslims to join the jihad, videos of their accomplishments,\nand intra-jihadist arguments increased significantly. More\nbroadly, discussion of Syria took on a palpably more sectar-\nian and radical tone.\nFigure 3. Keywords: \"Regime,\" \"Jihad,\" and \"Donation\".\n6 Research and Politics \nSeveral individual countries are worth highlighting.\nKuwait emerged as perhaps the most heavily invested\ncountry in the Syria debate. Kuwait hosted by far the largest\nconcentration of fundraising and consciousness- raising\ncampaigns, both online and offline. Parliamentarians such\nas Hajjaj al-Ajmi, Shafi Al-Ajmi, and Walid al-Tabtabie,\nand religious entrepreneurs such as Nabil al-Awadhy,\ngained enormous popularity for their exploits on behalf of\nthe Syrian rebels, while raising enormous sums of money.\nThe word \"Kuwait\" did not appear as often as might be\nexpected given this reality on the ground. We speculate that\nthis is because the fundraising campaigns were presented as\npan-Arab and Sunni rather than as national, and consciously\nsought contributions from other Gulf states with tighter\ncontrols over charities and finances (Dickinson, 2013).\nBahrain's unusual identity politics, with a Shi'a majority\nrepressed by a Sunni monarch, gave its Syria discourse a\nvery different quality. In the early Arab Spring, Bahrain's\nprotests were broadly seen through the frame of an Arab\nuprising, a mobilized Arab population challenging an auto-\ncratic regime. The Bahraini regime and its regional back-\ners, particularly in Saudi Arabia, instead defined the\nstruggle as one between a legitimate Sunni king and an\nIranian-backed Shi'ite subversion campaign. As that dis-\ncourse took hold, and as the Syria conflict became increas-\ningly sectarianized, Bahrain \"flipped\" discursively, with its\nShi'a citizens now cast as equivalent to the Syrian Alawi\ncommunity and Hezbollah. The nature of Bahrain/Syria\ntweets therefore varies significantly from what is seen in\nthe Sunni-majority Gulf states such as Kuwait, Qatar, and\nSaudi Arabia. Bahrain's mentions plummeted from 10.3%\nhad once been part of the \"Arab Spring\" came to be seen as\n\"not like us\" due to its Shi'ite majority, and thus phased out\nof the identity-shaped discourse. As one angry Bahraini\ntweeted: \"Syria: popular mobilization/Libya: popular\nmobilization/Egypt: popular mobilization/Tunisia: popular\nmobilization/Yemen: popular mobilization/Bahrain and\nQatif? Foreign Intervention\" (@m_abdali, October 2011,\ntranslated from Arabic).\nWhat about \"Palestine,\" traditionally that central issue\nof Arab political discourse? Interestingly, during 2011,\npeak Arab Spring, Palestine appeared in only 1.2% of all\nSyria tweets \u00ad far fewer than Bahrain (10.3%), and fewer\neven than Tunisia (2%). Palestine was not a primary refer-\nence point on Syria, compared to other Arab Spring coun-\ntries. One of the most popular tweets mentioning Palestine\nreferred to the failure of the outside world to help: \"Syria\nshouted, where are the Arabs? And Palestine laughed.\" In\ncertain key months, however, Palestine did surge into the\nSyria debate; only Kuwait and Bahrain were mentioned\nmore frequently in May 2012 (when Palestine was men-\ntioned in 3% of tweets), no other country was mentioned\nmore frequently in November 2012 (7%), and only Iraq\ngested the enduring, if latent, salience of the Palestine issue\nfor mobilization at key moments, as became strikingly\nclear in July 2014 when it quickly came to dominate online\nArab political discourse war broke out between Israel and\nHamas.\nImplications\nThis analysis offers strong support for the rise and fall of\nthe Arab Spring frame for the Syrian uprising. The findings\nshow clearly the intense identification and interaction\nwhich underlay the diffusion of protest across borders for\nmost of 2011. \"Arab Spring\" countries, not more obvious\ncandidates such as geographical neighbors or the Palestinian\nconflict, were the primary point of reference for these\nonline discussions. This intense interconnectedness lasted\nless than a year, however, and then sharply plummeted. The\n\"Arab Spring\" lens was replaced by both a regional sectar-\nian and Islamist narrative, and by a focus on the immediate\nneighbors most affected by the conflict. The Gulf states\nbecame a particularly intense site of online discussion\nabout Syria.\nThese findings document empirically the interconnected\nArab Spring online. These findings matter for our thinking\nabout the diffusion of protests and ideas, the social construc-\ntion of proximity, and the life-cycle of protest waves. The\nevidence that expectations, ideas, and protest movements\ntraveled between fellow \"Arab Spring\" countries even when\nnot physically proximate suggests the need to include iden-\ntity within theories of international diffusion. Much more\nneeds to be done with the sprawling wealth of online data\nrelevant to the Arab public sphere, including rigorous analy-\nsis of network clustering and the transmission of informa-\ntion. Our index of joint mentions is only one potential\nindicator of identification and attention, and could be sup-\nplemented with more intensive content analysis. More needs\nto be done to identify the specific mechanisms by which\nthese changes took place, including potentially exogenous\nfactors. Egyptians, Libyans, or Tunisians might, for instance,\nhave become preoccupied with their own struggles at home\nand dropped out of the Syria conversation. The online data\nmight also be supplemented with comparative evidence in\nthe broadcast media. Taken together, this analysis should sig-\nnificantly advance the empirical basis for evaluating theories\nof international diffusion.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the United States Institute for\nLynch et al. 7\nReferences\nAnden-Papadopolous K and Pantti M (2013) The media work\nof Syrian diaspora activists.
