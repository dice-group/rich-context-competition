Large-scale neuroimaging studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g.,\nmeasures of brain structure) of long-term stroke recovery following rehabilitation. However, analyzing large\nrehabilitation-related datasets is problematic due to barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-\ntraced lesions are currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation on T1-weighted MRIs, but are labor\nintensive and require anatomical expertise. While algorithms have been developed to automate this process, the\nresults often lack accuracy. Newer algorithms that employ machine-learning techniques are promising, yet these\nrequire large training datasets to optimize performance. Here we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions\nAfter Stroke), an open-source dataset of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented lesions and metadata.\nThis large, diverse dataset can be used to train and test lesion segmentation algorithms and provides a\nstandardized dataset for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods. We hope ATLAS\nrelease 1.1 will be a useful resource to assess and improve the accuracy of current lesion segmentation methods.\nDesign Type(s) parallel group design\nMeasurement Type(s) nuclear magnetic resonance assay\nTechnology Type(s) MRI Scanner\nFactor Type(s) regional part of brain \u00b7 cerebral hemisphere \u00b7 Clinical Diagnosis\nSample Characteristic(s) Homo sapiens \u00b7 brain\n1University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, USA. 2University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, USA.\nRehabilitation Hospital HT, Nesodden 1453, Norway. 6NORMENT and KG Jebsen Centre for Psychosis Research, Division of Mental Health\nand Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo 0372, Norway. 7Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo 0315, Norway. 8Child\nMind Institute, New York, New York 10022, USA. 9Nathan S.

In addition, up to 2/3 of stroke survivors experience long-term disabilities that impair\ntheir participation in daily activities2,3. Careful clinical decision making is thus critical both at the acute\nstage, where interventions can spare neural tissue or be used to promote early functional recovery4, and at\nthe subacute/chronic stages, where effective rehabilitation can promote long-term functional recovery.\nEnormous efforts have been made to predict outcomes and response to treatments at both acute and\nsubacute/chronic stages using brain imaging.\nAt the acute stage, within the first 24 h or so after stroke onset, clinicians face important, time-sensitive\ndecisions such as whether to intervene to save damaged tissue (e.g., administer thrombolytic drugs,\nperform surgery). Clinical brain images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized\ntomography (CT) scans are routinely acquired to help diagnose and make these urgent clinical decisions.\nImages obtained often include lower-resolution CT scans or structural MRIs (e.g., T2-weighted, FLAIR,\ndiffusion weighted, or perfusion weighted MRIs), and impressive efforts have been made to use these\nimages to automatically detect the lesion volume, predict responses to acute interventions, and predict\ngeneral prognosis. As clinical scans are typically a mandatory part of acute stroke care, there has been\nexcellent progress in using large-scale datasets of the acquired images to relate to outcomes and build\nautomated lesion detection algorithms and predictive models over the past few decades5. In addition,\nusing imaging to assess the extent of neural injury within the first few days after stroke can be helpful for\ninforming entry criteria and stratification variables for enrollment in clinical trials of early recovery\ntherapies, which have specific time windows shortly after stroke onset4.\nOn the other hand, there have been fewer advances in large-scale neuroimaging-based stroke\npredictions at the subacute and chronic stages. Here, clinicians must triage patients and assign scarce\nrehabilitation resources to those who are most likely to benefit and recover. Brain imaging, such as MRI,\nis primarily acquired as part of research studies to understand brain-related changes in response to\ndifferent therapeutic interventions or to provide valuable additional information, beyond what can be\ngleaned from bedside exams, that can be used to predict rehabilitation outcomes6. As stroke is a leading\ncause of adult disability worldwide, there is a large emphasis placed on predicting and understanding how\nto best promote long-term rehabilitation in these individuals. Although there are fewer MRIs acquired\nduring this time, the most common research scan is a high-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI, which\nis often acquired along with functional MRI and high-resolution diffusion MRI scans and can show\ninfarcts at the post-acute stage. Research using these types of images at this stage of stroke have shown\npromising biomarkers that could potentially provide additional information, beyond behavioral\nassessments, to predict an individual's likelihood of recovery for specific functions (e.g., motor, speech)\nand response to treatments7\u00ad9. Thus far, measures that include the size, location, and overlap of the lesion\nwith existing brain regions or structures, such as the corticospinal tract, have been successfully used as\npredictors of long-term stroke recovery and rehabilitation9\u00ad15. However, to date, this has only been done\nin smaller-scale studies, and results may conflict across studies or be limited to each sample. Examining\nlesion properties with larger datasets at the subacute and chronic stages could lead to the identification of\nmore robust biomarkers for rehabilitation that are widely applicable across diverse populations. Recently,\nefforts for creating large-scale stroke neuroimaging datasets across all time points since stroke onset have\nemerged and offer a promising approach to achieve a better understanding of the long-term stroke\nrecovery process (e.g., ENIGMA Stroke Recovery; http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-stroke-\nrecovery/).\nHowever, a key barrier to properly analyzing these large-scale stroke neuroimaging datasets to predict\nrehabilitation outcomes is accurate lesion segmentation. While many acute neuroimaging stroke studies\nbypass manual lesion segmentation by using a visual scoring of lesion characteristics with validated\nscoring tools applied by expert raters, research studies that wish to examine the overlap of the lesion with\nspecific brain structures (e.g., in voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, or lesion load methods) require\nan accurate and detailed lesion map. In T1-weighted MRIs, which are often used in research, the gold\nstandard for delineating these lesions is manual segmentation, a process that requires skilled tracers and\ncan be prohibitively time consuming and subjective16. A single large or complex lesion can take up to\nseveral hours for even a skilled tracer. As a result of this demand on time and effort, this method, which\nhas been used in previous smaller neuroimaging studies, is not suitable for larger sample sizes. Based on\nthe literature, most studies with manually segmented brain lesions on T1-weighted MRIs use smaller\nsample sizes between 10 to just over 100 brains16\u00ad20. Accurately segmenting hundreds or thousands of\nstroke lesions from T1-weighted MRIs may thus present a barrier for larger-scale stroke neuroimaging\nstudies.\nMany stroke neuroimaging studies have utilized semi- or fully-automated lesion segmentation tools\nfor their analyses. Semi-automated segmentation tools employ a combination of automated algorithms,\nwhich detect abnormalities in the MR image, and manual corrections or inputs by an expert. Fully-\nautomated algorithms rely completely on the algorithm for the lesion segmentation. While these require\nlittle human input or expertise, they still may require significant computational resources and processing\ntime. Many of these fully-automated algorithms employ machine learning techniques that require\ntraining and testing on large datasets21, and the performance of the algorithm is highly dependent on the\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nsize and diversity of the training dataset. While there have been several exciting initiatives regarding\nlesion segmentation in acute clinical imaging, discussed below, there are few publically available large\ntraining/test datasets of manually segmented stroke lesion masks on research-grade T1-weighted images\nthat could be used for improving such algorithms. Thus, while both semi- and fully-automated lesion\nsegmentation tools have the potential to greatly reduce the time and expertise needed to analyze stroke\nMRI data22, it is unclear whether they provide the accuracy needed for rigorous stroke lesion-based\nanalyses.\nIn addition, it is difficult to compare the performance of automated lesion segmentation tools as they\nare often not evaluated for performance on the same dataset. Recently, some exciting initiatives have\nemerged to develop better segmentation algorithms using standardized datasets and metrics. In\nparticular, the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge is an annual satellite challenge of\nthe Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) meeting that provides a\nstandardized multimodal clinical MRI dataset of approximately 50\u00ad100 brains with manually segmented\nlesions23. The ISLES competition encourages research groups to use the dataset to evaluate their lesion\nsegmentation algorithms and predict acute outcomes to inform clinical decision making. This approach is\npromising for developing better lesion segmentation algorithms and predictive models for acute imaging.\nHowever, past ISLES challenge datasets have traditionally focused more on using multimodal clinical\nMRIs to predict more acute results, and these algorithms are not easily translatable to the high-quality\nT1-weighted MRIs typically found in subacute/chronic stroke rehabilitation research. Thus, here, we\naimed to develop a complementary large dataset using only anatomical T1-weighted MRIs, which are\ntypically acquired in research studies after the acute stage to assess rehabilitation outcomes. We anticipate\nthis dataset could be useful for enhancing lesion segmentation methods for T1-weighted images often\nused in medical rehabilitation research.\nHere, we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke) Release 1.1, an open-source\ndataset consisting of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented diverse lesions and metadata. The\ngoal of ATLAS is to provide the research community with a standardized training and testing dataset for\nlesion segmentation algorithms on T1-weighted MRIs. We note that this dataset is not representative of\nthe full range of stroke, as this data was acquired through research studies in which individuals with\nstroke voluntarily participated, and all participants had to be eligible for a research MRI session.\nHowever, this dataset may be useful for testing and comparing the performance of different lesion\nsegmentation techniques and identifying key barriers hindering the performance of automated lesion\nsegmentation algorithms. We believe that this diverse set of manually segmented lesions will serve as a\nvaluable resource for researchers to use in assessing and improving the accuracy of lesion\nsegmentation tools.\nMethods\nData overview\n304 MRI images from 11 cohorts worldwide were collected from research groups in the ENIGMA Stroke\nRecovery Working Group consortium. Images consisted of T1-weighted anatomical MRIs of individuals\nafter stroke. These images were collected primarily for research purposes and are not representative of the\noverall general stroke population (e.g., only including individuals who opt in to participate in a research\nstudy, and excluding individuals with stroke who cannot undergo MRI safely).\nFor each MRI, brain lesions were identified and masks were manually drawn on each individual brain\nin native space using MRIcron24, an open-source tool for brain imaging visualization and defining\nvolumes of interest (http://people.cas.sc.edu/rorden/mricron/index.html). At least one lesion mask was\nidentified for each individual MRI. If additional, separate (non-contiguous) lesions were identified, they\nwere traced as separate masks. An expert neuroradiologist reviewed all lesions to provide additional\nqualitative descriptions of the type of stroke, primary lesion location, vascular territory, and intensity of\nwhite matter disease. Finally, a separate tracer performed quality control on each lesion mask. This\nincluded assessing the accuracy of the lesion segmentations, revising the lesion mask if needed, and\ncategorizing the lesions to generate additional data such as the number of lesions in left and right\nhemispheres, and in cortical and subcortical regions. This dataset is provided in native subject space and\narchived (n = 304). A subset of this dataset was also defaced, intensity normalized, and provided in\nstandard space (normalized to the MNI-152 template, n = 229; for an overview of the dataset and\narchives, see Fig. 1).\nAll ATLAS contributions were based on studies approved by local ethics committees and were\nconducted in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all\nsubjects. The receiving site's ethics committee at the University of Southern California approved the\nreceipt and sharing of the de-identified data. Data were fully de-identified by removing all 18 HIPAA\n(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability)-protected health information identifiers, lesions were\nmanually segmented on each MRI, and all data were visually inspected before release. In addition, the\nterms of the data sharing agreements were approved by the University of Southern California's\ntechnology transfer office.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nData characteristics\nAll T1-weighted MRI data were collected on 3T MRI scanners at a resolution of 1 mm3 (isotropic), with\nthe exception of data from cohorts 1 and 2 which were collected on a 1.5T scanner with a resolution of\n0.9 mm \u00d7 0.9 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm (excluded from the normalized dataset). Scanner information (scanner\nstrength, brand) and image resolution are included in the ATLAS meta-data, and sample image header\ninformation for a subject from each of the cohorts can be found in Supplementary Information.\nCharacteristics of the ATLAS dataset include an average lesion volume across all cohorts of\n2.838 \u00d7 105 mm3. Information regarding the distribution of lesions in the ATLAS dataset (e.g., single\nversus multiple lesions per individual, percent of lesions that are left versus right hemisphere, or\nsubcortical versus cortical) can be found in Tables 1 and 2. Overall, slightly more than half of the subjects\nhad only one lesion (58%) while the rest had multiple lesions (42.1%). Lesions were roughly equally\ndistributed between left and right hemispheres (48.4% left hemisphere, 43.8% right hemisphere, 7.7%\nother location such as brainstem or cerebellum). In this dataset, there were more subcortical lesions than\nTraining individuals performing lesion tracing\nEleven individuals were carefully trained in identifying and segmenting lesions. Individuals had a range of\nbackgrounds, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. All tracers\nwere given detailed information regarding neuroanatomy, and underwent standardized training, which\nutilized a detailed protocol as well as an instructional video. All tracers were guided through the training\nprocess with extensive feedback on lesion tracing performance by an expert tracer and in consultation\nwith an expert neuroradiologist. The detailed protocol, with pictures of example tracings, is freely\navailable and can be found on the ATLAS GitHub website (https://github.com/npnl/ATLAS/). All\nindividuals were trained on an initial set of 5 brains with varying lesion sizes and locations (size range:\nAfter tracing the first set of 5 lesions, tracings were reviewed by an experienced tracer and differences in\nthe lesion masks were discussed with the tracer. One week later, individuals retraced the lesions on the\nsame set of 5 brains, but were blinded to their first segmentation attempt to examine intra-tracer\nreliability. After this, each lesion segmentation was reviewed by a separate tracer. In addition, the primary\nlesion location was identified by an expert neuroradiologist, who also created the meta-data (see\nMetadata below). Any questions regarding lesion masks were referred to the neuroradiologist. Inter- and\nintra-rater reliability measures and additional technical validation of the lesion tracings can be found in\nTechnical Validation below. Finally, we note that lesion tracing is a subjective process, even across trained\nindividuals. As mentioned in Usage Notes below, any problems, questions, or issues with specific lesion\nmasks can be publically reported on our ATLAS GitHub under the Issues page (https://github.com/npnl/\nATLAS/issues) so that the community of users can make comments and be aware of any identified issues.\nWe will work to resolve any issues in a timely manner.\nIdentifying and tracing lesions\nTo identify lesions, each T1-weighted MRI image was displayed using the multiple view option in\nMRIcron20, which displays the brain in the coronal, sagittal, and axial view (see Fig. 2). To identify\nlesions, tracers looked for darker intensities within typically healthy tissue. For lesions that were more\ndifficult to detect with the grayscale setting, colored look-up table settings (e.g., `cardiac', `NIH', or\n`spectrum' settings in MRIcron) were used to provide additional insight. Once the lesion or lesions were\nidentified, the lesion mask was traced using either the coronal or axial view, using either a mouse, track\nFigure 1. A schematic diagram showing the steps performed on the data for each archive release.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\npad, or tablet (i.e., Wacom Intuos Draw). A combination of MRIcron tools was used to draw the lesion\nmasks, which included the 3D fill tool, the pen tool and the closed pen tool. Typically, and especially for\nlarger sized lesions, tracers used the 3D fill tool to begin the segmentation. Crosshairs were placed in the\ncenter of the identified lesion and the tool would fill in voxels similar to the one at the point of origin with\nthe selected radius and at the sensitivity specified by the difference from origin and difference at edge\ntools. The pen and closed pen tool, typically was used to fill in (or remove) the areas that the 3D tool had\nmissed or was used to trace smaller lesions slice by slice. Once completed, lesion masks were saved in the\nvolume of interest (VOI) file format with the identifier name `cXXXXsXXXXtXX_LesionRaw' (see Data\nRecords and Table 3 below for full naming conventions). Lesions masks were then checked for correctness\nby a separate tracer, who made additional corrections to the lesion mask, if needed. After lesions were\nidentified as being correct, masks were smoothed using MRIcron's smooth VOI tool where the full width\nhalf maximum parameter was set to 2 mm and the threshold was set to 0.5. These masks were saved in\nboth VOI and NIfTI file formats with the identifier name `cXXXXsXXXXtXX_LesionSmooth'.\nCohort Number of Subjects Brains with One Lesion Brains with Multiple Lesions\nLeft Right Other\nTable 1. A total of 304 subjects within 11 cohorts were included in the full ATLAS Release 1.1 native\ndataset. The number of brains in which only one lesion was found (left/right hemispheres and other locations\nfound within the brainstem and cerebellum, etc.), and the number of brains in which multiple lesions were\nfound, are shown.\nCohort Cortical Lesions Subcortical Only Lesions Other Lesion Locations\nLeft Right Left Right\nTable 2. The number of lesions found in each location (i.e., cortical versus subcortical; left versus\nright hemispheres), and other locations (i.e., brainstem, cerebellum, etc.) are shown. Here we have\nincluded primary lesions as well as additional lesions, resulting in 521 total lesion masks across n = 304.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nAny additional lesions that were not contiguous with the primary lesion mask were drawn as separate\nlesion masks and labeled. As described in Data Records, any secondary lesions followed the same\nprocedures as the primary lesion mask, but were labeled as Lesion_1, Lesion_2, Lesion_3 and so on, with\nthe naming convention moving from the largest to smallest mask (e.g., Lesion_1 is the largest secondary\nlesion mask). In general, the primary lesion mask was the largest lesion, with any secondary lesion masks\nsubsequently named and ordered by size (largest to smallest). The only exception to this was, in the case\nof multiple lesions, if the neuroradiologist identified a primary stroke location as a different lesion from\nthe largest lesion mask. In these cases, we used the lesion identified by the neuroradiologist as the primary\nmask. This occurred in less than 5% of the subjects.\nMetadata\nFor each lesion, we also provided metadata on the lesion properties to give the user additional qualitative\ninformation, beyond the binary lesion mask. This information can be used to quickly sort the dataset\nbased on specific lesion characteristics (e.g., only left hemisphere lesions, or only subcortical lesions). It\ncan also provide additional insight into the types of lesions that succeed or fail for a given lesion\nsegmentation algorithm. The lesion properties were manually reported for each individual lesion mask.\nThese include the number of lesions identified and traced, and the location of each lesion (i.e., right/left,\nsubcortical, cortical, or other). In order to count each lesion only once, we defined subcortical lesions as\nlesions that are contained completely in the white matter and subcortical structures. Any lesion that\nextends beyond this area and into the cortex is considered a cortical lesion. In this way, cortical lesions\nmay extend into the subcortical space, but subcortical lesions do not extend into the cortical space.\n`Other' includes the brainstem and cerebellum. An experienced neuroradiologist also identified the\nfollowing information for each individual brain: the type of stroke (e.g., embolic, hemorrhagic), primary\nstroke location, vascular territory, and intensity of white matter disease (periventricular hyperintensities,\nor PVH, and deep white matter hyperintensities, or DWMH). White matter hyperintensities were graded\nusing the Fazekas scale25. For periventricular hyperintensities, the following grades were applied:\n0 = absence, 1 = 'caps' or pencil-thin lining, 2 = smooth `halo', 3 = irregular PVH extending into the deep\nwhite matter. For deep white matter hyperintensities, the following grades were applied: a = absence,\n1 = punctate foci, 2 = beginning confluence of foci, 3 = large confluent areas. The white matter\nhyperintensity ratings are included because areas of white matter hyperintensity often pose challenges for\nlesion segmentation algorithms. Finally, scanner strength, brand/model, and image resolution are\nincluded in the metadata as well.\nNormalization to a standard template, intensity normalization, and defacing\nTo expand access to the dataset, we have also provided a subset of the data that is defaced, intensity-\nnormalized, and normalized to standard (MNI-152) space. Lesion segmentation algorithms vary in\nwhether the input should be in native (subject) space or a standardized space. Therefore, to provide this\noption for users, we also generated a version of the ATLAS dataset in standard space. To convert the\nimages to standard space, MRI images first underwent automated correction for intensity non-uniformity\nFigure 2. An example of lesion segmentation in MRICron.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nand intensity standardization using custom scripts derived from the MINC-toolkit26 (https://github.com/\nBIC-MNI/minc-toolkit). These corrected images were linearly registered to the MNI-152 template using a\nversion that was nonlinearly constructed and symmetric (version 2009; http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/\nServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009) to normalize their intracranial volume in a standardized stereotaxic\nspace27. Using the resulting transformation matrix, the labels drawn on the MRI images were also\nregistered to the MNI template. The MRI images were resampled using the linear interpolation whereas\ntheir labels used a nearest neighborhood interpolation to keep their binary nature. Finally. Freesurfer's\nmri_deface tools were used to perform the defacing (e.g., to remove any facial structures) (https://surfer.\nnmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface) on all T1-weighted images.\nDue to technical difficulties and differences in scanner image quality, a subset of brains is not included\nin the standard space conversion, resulting in a total of n = 229 ATLAS brains converted into standard\nMNI space. Scans from the two cohorts with 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 3.0 mm resolution images, collected on 1.5T\nscanners, were excluded from this standardized dataset due to their lower resolution. In addition, any\nimages that failed registration were excluded. Primary reasons for failed registration include large lesion\nvolumes or poor image quality (e.g., image artifacts, motion artifacts). We are currently working on\nmanually editing the registrations for these images, which will be released in the future. This dataset can\nbe widely accessed from the FCP-INDI archive (see Fig. 1 and Table 3 for archive details). All images\nwere named in accordance with the INDI data policy, following the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS),\nand a meta-data sheet using the INDI naming convention is included with this dataset.\nProbabilistic spatial mapping of ATLAS lesion labels\nWe also created a probabilistic spatial mapping of the lesion labels solely to visualize the distribution of\nlesion masks across the normalized ATLAS dataset. We note that this does not provide a representation\nof a true stroke distribution, but rather shows the distribution of lesions included in this dataset. To do\nthis, we performed a population-based averaging of all the individual primary lesion labels in MNI space,\nproducing a voxel-wise map where values can range from 0 at each voxel (always background for all\nsubjects) to 1 (100% presence of the lesion label across subjects). A probabilistic spatial map of the\nprimary lesions can be found in Fig. 3 and a 3D visualization of the lesion map can be found in the\nfollowing video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = Ag5CUsRNY9Q. In addition, this map has also\nbeen provided in NIfTI format (.nii.gz) and uploaded to NeuroVault.org, an open-source database for\nneuroimaging data where it can be freely accessed (https://neurovault.org/collections/3073/).\nData Records\nThe full raw dataset (native dataset, n = 304) is archived with the Archive of Disability Data to Enable\nPolicy research at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (Data Citation 1).\nICPSR is the world's largest social science data archive that supports several substantive-area archive\ncollections including disability and rehabilitation. ICPSR provides access to the data and provides\ntechnical assistance to individuals accessing the data.. In addition, a standardized, defaced subset of the\ndataset (standardized dataset, n = 229) is archived with the 1,000 Functional Connectomes Project\nInternational Data Sharing Initiative (FCP-INDI), which hosts many widely available neuroimaging\ndatasets (Data Citation 2). See Usage Notes for more details regarding access.\nFor the full dataset archived with ICPSR, the naming convention and description of the files in ATLAS\nR1.1 can be found in Table 3. Within the ATLAS R1.1 main folder, there is an excel file with the metadata\nfor the entire dataset. The data in this archive is in native space (i.e., original subject space; n = 304).\nThroughout the dataset, MRIs are named and sorted based on each cohort (c); each cohort is in the\nformat of cXXXX where XXXX is the number that the cohort was assigned (e.g., c0001).

Subject folders are named\nbased on the cohort that they are in (cXXXX), the subject number that they were assigned (sXXXX) and\nthe time point at which they were taken (tXX) (e.g., c0001s0004t01). For instance, participants with data\ntaken two weeks apart would have two time points, where t01 is the first time point and t02 is the second.\nEvery image starts with the subject identifier of cXXXXsXXXXtXX.\nEach subject folder has several components: at minimum, each will have the original T1-weighted MRI\nimage (*.nii.gz) and three masks for the main lesion: the unsmoothed lesion mask (*LesionRaw.voi), and\ntwo smoothed lesion masks in.voi and.nii.gz formats (*LesionSmooth.voi; *LesionSmooth.nii.gz). The\nLesionRaw volume is the original hand-traced lesion volume, while the LesionSmooth volume used a\nGaussian smoothing kernel (full width half maximum parameter set to 2 mm, threshold set to 0.5, to\novercome small errors between slices in tracing; see Methods above). We anticipated that most\nresearchers would use the LesionSmooth volume as it is slightly more robust to small slice-by-slice\nhuman errors, and therefore created the.nii.giz version from this. Notably, the.voi files are in an MRIcron\nformat so the masks can be further edited in MRICron if desired. The.nii.gz files use the standard NIfTI\nformat28 (http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/), which can be opened, edited, and viewed by most standard\nneuroimaging software.\nIf a particular subject had multiple lesions, for each additional lesion, there would be three additional\nlesion masks (e.g., *LesionRaw_1.voi, *LesionSmooth_1.voi, *LesionSmooth_1.nii.gz). In general, lesions\nwere ranked based on size where the largest lesion was considered the main lesion. As mentioned\npreviously, if the largest lesion differed from the primary lesion identified by the neuroradiologist, we\ndeemed the primary lesion to be the one identified by the neuroradiologist. This occurred in less than 5%\nof cases.\nFinally, in the FCP-INDI archive (standardized dataset, n = 229), there is a separate naming\nconvention, following the Brain Imaging Data Structure (http://bids.neuroimaging.io/), adopted by FCP-\nINDI. Images in this dataset have been normalized to a standard MNI-152 template, intensity\nnormalized, and defaced. Table 3 provides a list of all naming conventions and filenames, along with\ndescriptions.\nTechnical Validation\nEach trained tracer created lesion masks for the same five brains twice, one week apart, to assess both\ninter- and intra-tracer reliability. Training lesions ranged in size and difficulty (see Methods). Each\ntracer's lesion masks were compared, providing both inter- and intra-rater reproducibility measures. We\nfirst calculated inter- and intra-rater reliability measures using the lesion volumes. Based on lesion\nIn addition, we also calculated inter-and intra-rater reliability using the Dice similarity coefficient\n(DC), which is a segmentation accuracy metric, and Hausdorff's distance (HD), which is a metric of the\nmaximum distance between two volumes surface points. DC allows us to examine not only if the volumes\nare similar, but also if the same voxels are being selected as part of the lesion mask or not. This is\nparticularly useful for comparing neuroimaging volumes, such as lesion masks. DC is calculated by the\nformula:\nDC \u00bc\nj j\nX\nj j \u00fe Y\nj j\nwhere X and Y represent the voxels from each lesion segmentation, and DC ranges from 0 to 1 (where 0\nmeans there were no overlapping voxels and 1 means that the segmentations were completely the same).\nHD allows us to examine the distance between the surfaces of two images and thus can be used to identify\noutliers, providing another useful metric for comparing neuroimaging volumes. HD is calculated by the\nFigure 3. A probabilistic lesion overlap map for the primary lesions from the ATLAS R1.1 dataset. A 3D\nvisualization of the lesion overlap map can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = Ag5CUsRNY9Q.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nformula:\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc max max min d x; y\n\u00f0 \u00de\nx AX y AY\n; max min d y; x\n\u00f0 \u00de\ny AY x A X\n( )\nwhere x and y represent the surface points from the volumes X and Y respectively. HD is measured in\nmillimeters, and a lower value denotes that the maximum distance between the two images is smaller.\nInter-rater scores (DC, HD) were calculated for each manual segmentation by comparing each\nindividual tracer's lesion mask to the rest of the tracers' lesion masks. Inter-rater DC and inter-rater HD\nscores were then averaged to obtain one final DC score and one final HD score for the initial\nsegmentations (average inter-rater DC for first segmentation: 0.73 \u00b1 0.20; average inter-rater HD for first\nsegmentation: 22.57 \u00b1 21.36 mm) and for the second segmentations (average inter-rater DC for second\nsegmentation: average inter-rater HD for second segmentations: 25.29 \u00b1 23.53 mm). Furthermore, intra-\nrater DC and HD scores were calculated for each brain traced by comparing the initial segmentation to\nthe secondary segmentation for each tracer; these scores were then averaged to obtain a final intra-rater\nTrained tracers segmented all lesion masks. In addition, each lesion mask was checked by a separate\ntracer, and changes were made to the lesion mask as needed. Any difficulty identifying the lesion was\ndiscussed with the expert neuroradiologist. Lastly, after the completion of the dataset, lesion masks\nwere checked a second time to ensure correct segmentation and data descriptors. It is important to\nnote that while tracers did participate in a thorough training process and segmentations were checked\nmultiple times, this is still a subjective process. Comments regarding the lesion masks can be submitted as\nissues on the ATLAS GitHub site (https://github.com/npnl/ATLAS/issues), and we plan to publish\nupdated and expanded versions of this dataset based on feedback and comments from users (see Usage\nNotes).\nUsage Notes\nThe full native-space archived dataset (n = 304) can be found at ICPSR (Data Citation 1). For more\ninformation on the data archive, visit the ICPSR website (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb).\nIn addition, a standardized, intensity-normalized, defaced subset of the data (n = 229) can be found at\nFCP-INDI (Data Citation 2).\nData is accessible under a standard Data Use Agreement, under which users must agree to only use the\ndata for purposes as described in the agreement. Users of the ATLAS dataset should acknowledge the\ncontributions of the original authors and research labs by properly citing this article and the data\nrepository link from which they accessed the data.\nAs described above, lesions were segmented using the NITRC open source software MRIcron which\ncan be downloaded from the NITRC website (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron). Users can also\nquickly and easily view the brains on BrainBox (http://brainbox.pasteur.fr/), an open-source Web\napplication to collaboratively annotate and segment neuroimaging data available online29. For additional\nquick quantification, our group has also created a small package of scripts called SRQL (Semi-automated\nRobust Quantification of Lesions), which provide three features: it uses a semi-automated white matter\nintensity correction to further correct for human errors in lesion tracing, outputs a report of descriptive\nstatistics on lesions (hemisphere and volume of lesion), and gives users the option to perform analyses in\nnative or standard space (https://github.com/npnl/SRQL)30. In addition, as we plan to grow this dataset\nin the future, additional releases of data or software will be announced on our ATLAS GitHub page\n(https://github.com/npnl/ATLAS/). Any issues or feedback can also be submitted on the ATLAS GitHub\npage under `issues,' and a team of researchers will address these in a timely manner. Finally, as a general\nnote regarding the usage of this dataset, we strongly encourage users to be cautious of overfitting training\nalgorithms to this particular dataset. We note that this data is relatively diverse, given the data collection\nacross 11 research sites worldwide. However, we caution users against overfitting to only a particular\ncohort or subset of this data. Future work will aim to provide additional test datasets for users to properly\ntest their algorithms on untrained data.\nReferences\n1. Benjamin, E. J. et al.
