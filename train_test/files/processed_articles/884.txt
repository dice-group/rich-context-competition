About four of every one hundred\npersons in the United States were found to have migraine, accounting for nearly 10 million individuals.\nMigraine was most prevalent in those aged 25 to 44 years and was about 2.5 times more frequent in\nfemales than males. Migraine was most common in whites (85%) and those with low household income. In\nwomen, migraine prevalence increased with the level of education. About 10% of migrainous children\nmissed at least one day of school over a two-week period due to migraine; nearly 1% missed four days.\nMigraineurs were bedridden for about three million days per month and had an estimated 74.2 million days\nper year of restricted activity due to migraine. The potential cost of lost productivity was estimated at $1.4\nbillion per year for the estimated 6,196,378 migraineurs who worked outside the home. It is difficult to\nderive similar estimates for costs of lost productivity in housewives; however, housewives experienced an\nestimated 38 million days per year of restricted activity. Eighty-five percent of females and 77% of males\nreported a physician visit at some point for their migraine. Migraine is a relatively common disease whose\nsocial and financial impact has been poorly understood.\nKey words: Migraine, Epidemiology, Prevalence, Lost productivity, Cost, NHIS\nAbbreviations: NHIS National Health Interview  , NCHS National Center for Health Statistics\nINTRODUCTION\nMigraine headache is an intermittent disorder with an unpredictable course and no known cure or completely\neffective treatment. Surprisingly little is known about how this disorder affects an entire population. Information\nabout migraine and those afflicted with it has been difficult to obtain. Most migraine epidemiology studies have\ninvolved small numbers of subjects, specific age groups, limited geographical areas, or study samples culled from\nspecialty clinics, outpatient practices, or tertiary care centers.1-12 Not all of those suffering with migraine seek\nmedical attention.3,7,10 Therefore, some groups may be under represented in studies of patients consulting\nphysicians for treatment of migraine. Persons with low income, individuals with headache that responds to\nover-the-counter analgesics, those who experience no disability, and those who perceive their headache to be of\nmild-to-moderate intensity or of short duration are most likely to be overlooked.4 Only one study has assessed the\nincidence of migraine across all ages in a well-defined population,2 while another recent study has examined the\nEvery year since 1957, the National Center for Health Statistics has conducted the National Health Interview\n  (NHIS). An integral part of this survey involves the ascertainment, by personal interview, of acute and\nchronic conditions experienced by the survey participants (e.g. migraine headache).14 The participants of the NHIS\ncomprise a large sample of US households that enables determination of national estimates of disease-specific\ndemographics and prevalence, disease-related impairment, health outcomes, and health ca re service utilization for\nthe noninstitutionalized civilian population.14\nBecause of its large size and complex sampling scheme, the NHIS may provide some broad insight into the\ndemographics of migraine sufferers as well as an appreciation of the impairment caused by this disorder. However,\nthe information on migraine has not been widely disseminated. The purpose of this report is to describe, using data\ncollected during the 1989 NHIS, the epidemiology of migraine, the magnitude of the impairment caused by this\ndisorder, and to estimate the potential costs associated with this impairment from a U.S. population perspective.\nMETHODS\nEach year a large sample of the US population participates in the National Health Interview   (NHIS). The methods used for this survey have\nbeen previously described.14 To facilitate estimation of the prevalence of chronic conditions, the NHIS sample is randomly divided into six\nrepresentative subsamples. In addition to answering demographic questions (e.g. age, sex, race, occupation, household income, years of education,\ngeographic location), participants in each subsample are administered one of six checklists of chronic conditions and are asked to indicate the\npresence or absence of these conditions. Hence, annual estimates of the prevalence of self-reported conditions (e.g. migraine headache) can be\nobtained. Impairment due to the condition (i.e. physician visits, hospitalization) is also ascertained. Respondents also are asked about the number of\ndays spent in bed, days with restricted activity, and days missed from school or work due to migraine in the two weeks immediately preceding the\ninterview. These questions allow estimates of the impact of migraine on daily living while limiting recall bias.\nFor this analysis, data from the 1989 NHIS were accessed using public-use data tapes from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). In\nanalyzed separately. Demographic data as well as information concerning physician visits or hospitalizations due to migraine and the number of days\nof restricted activity, days spent in bed, and days missed from school were evaluated.\nThese data were analyzed using a mainframe-based statistical software system (SAS Institute, Release 6.06, Cary, North Carolina). To derive the\nmost accurate population estimates, estimation procedures and sampling errors provided with the data by the NCHS were used in all extrapolations.\nFurthermore, all proportions derived were based on extrapolated figures, Estimates for the general US population were derived in a similar manner,\nthus maximizing internal validity.\nTo estimate the costs of lost productivity associated with any days of restricted activity due to migraine,\nmedian-daily-earnings-by-employment-type data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used.15 These earnings data were applied to the number\nof restricted activity days reported over a two-week period within an occupational category to estimate the costs associated with lost productivity.\nThese estimates were then annualized.\nRestricted activity is a global measurement of lost productivity, capturing days spent in bed or days missed from either work or school, and was\nused to estimate the cost of lost productivity. The assumption was made that if a migraine caused restricted activity, productivity was lower whether\nthe migraineur went to work or stayed at home.\nRESULTS\nDemographics.-Migraine headache affected an estimated 9,978,393 Americans in 1989, with an overall prevalence of 4.1%. The prevalence of\nmigraine by age and sex is illustrated in Figure 1. Migraine was most prevalent in the 25- to 44-year-old age group. Migraine was about 2.5 times\nmore common in females than males (prevalence, 5.77% vs 2.32%).\nSignificant differences among races in the prevalence of migraine were found. Migraine was reported by 4.2% of whites, 3.6% of blacks (P<.01 vs\nwhites), and 3.2% of other races (P<.01 vs whites). Eighty-nine percent of male migraineurs and 85%\nof female migraineurs were white.\nMigraineurs had approximately the same distribution of household income as the US population in general. Self-reported migraine was slightly\nmore common (P<.01) among those with household income less than $10,000 compared to those with higher household income in both males and\nfemales (Figure 2). Overall, migraineurs were more likely to be part of the labor force compared with the general US population. Among these, a\nhigher percentage of employed migraineurs were in executive and professional positions or in occupations traditionally held by women (e.g.\nadministrative support, private household) (Table 1). The prevalence of migraine increased with increasing level of education, especially in females\n(Figure 3).\nGeographic differences in the distribution of migraine headache were also noted. The northeast had the lowest prevalence of migraine (3.96%)\nwhile prevalence was highest in the west (4.96%) (Figure 4).\nHealth Care Utilization.-Among those with migraine, the likelihood of a physician visit or hospitalization for treatment of headache varied somewhat by age\n(Figure 5). Females were more likely than males to have seen a physician for migraine (85% vs 77%); hospitalization rates for treatment of migraine were slightly\nhigher for females than for males (8.4% vs 6.2%).\nLost Productivity.-Migraine was related to significant losses in productivity as reflected by missed school days for children and days of restricted activity for\nmissed in any two-week period due to migraine. On average, 10% of school-aged migraineurs missed at least one day of school over a two-week period because\nof migraine; nearly 1% missed four days.\nAmong all migraineurs, over three million days per month were spent bedridden due to migraine (Table 2); females accounted for about 75% of these days.\nEmployed male migraineurs had an estimated 2.7 million days per year of restricted activity, while employed female migraineurs had an estimated 18.8 million\ndays per year of restricted activity (Figure 6). Housewives experienced 38.5 million days per year of restricted activity and lost productivity.\nPrevalence of Migraine by Occupation, Based on the 1989 National Health Interview  \nOccupation Percent of Percent of US Percent Males Percent Females\nMigraineurs1 Population With With\nExecutive,\nProfessional\nTechnicians\nAdministrative\nNon-protective,\nFarming, Forestry,\nPrecision craft\nMachine operators,\nTransportation\nHandlers, helpers,\n2 meaning percent of US population with this occupation who have migraine headache\n3 meaning of males/females with migraine, the percent with this occupation\nImpact of Migraine on Daily Activities Over a Two-Week\nAge-Range Person-Days Spent Person-Days of\n(yrs) in Bed Restricted\nBased on 1989 National Health Interview  \n1 Global measure of functioning, includes number of bedridden days\nCost of Lost Productivity.-The potential cost of lost productivity due to migraine is estimated at $115.6 million per month or nearly\n$1.4 billion per year for the 6,196,378 migraineurs who were employed (Figure 6).

Because of its large size and\ncomplex sampling scheme, the NHIS provides an opportunity to examine how migraine affects the US population. The 1989 NHIS\ninvolved a sample of nearly 117,000 individuals; approximately 20,000 of these were interviewed about migraine headache.\nLimitations of the NHIS.-Some weaknesses are inherent in this descriptive study of migraine. First, the NHIS is based on a sample\nof the US population. As with any sample, the estimates and extrapolations obtained from it have some variability. Sampling error\ncorrections were applied to minimize the impact of biased sampling. Second, the attribution of migraine was self-reported, and as such,\nwas not subjected to any diagnostic criteria to establish its validity. Whether this results in under- or over estimation of migraine is\nunclear. Clinical diagnostic criteria are gaining acceptance for diagnosis of migraine,16 but it was not possible to apply these criteria to\nthe NHIS data.\nThird, the responses were obtained in an interview with one member of the household who reported for each inhabitant of the\nhousehold. This may lead to underestimation of migraine prevalence because mild or infrequent migraine may not have been recognized\nby the household reporter. Furthermore, recall bias was a potential problem in this study as participants were sometimes asked to recall\nevents over several months or years. However, recall bias was minimized by limiting recall of more detailed information to a two-week\nperiod.\nDemographics.-In spite of these potential pitfalls, the NHIS data confirm several findings from epidemiologic studies in smaller,\nmore limited populations. In addition, however, several interesting differences were also noted.\nThe NHIS data reflect a female preponderance and peak occurrence of migraine in those aged 25-44 years, findings consistent with\nprevious work.1-6,8-10,12 The finding of lower prevalence of migraine in the northeast supports the findings of a recent survey of\nmigraine that showed New England to have the lowest migraine prevalence in the nation.13 When other investigators pooled the results\nof the NHIS for the years 1986 to 1988, migraine prevalence over the three-year period was also highest in the west and lowest in the\nnortheast.17 The reason for the low prevalence of migraine in the northeast is unclear.\nThe NHIS showed that the prevalence of migraine in females was 5.77%, and in males it was 2.32%.\nPrevalence rates reported in other studies range from 3% to 28% in females and from 1% to 19% in\nmales.4,7,9,10,18-20 The wide variation is likely due to the different diagnostic criteria for migraine and\nascertainment methods (i.e. telephone vs mailed questionnaire vs record review) used in these studies. A\nmigraine prevalence rates, 17.6% in women and 5,7% in males, than those reflected by the NHIS data. These\ndata were derived from self-administered questionnaires with self-defined severe headache as the basis for\nmore in-depth questioning, In addition, the population sampled was skewed toward, but not limited to,\nupper-income white households. It is unclear if response bias accounts for these higher rates, as those with\nheadache are more likely to respond to a headache questionnaire.\nThe rates of self-reported migraine in the 1989 NHIS were significantly higher in whites than in blacks and\nother minorities. These differences might be actual or the result of biases inherent in self-reported data.\nSome researchers have not shown a significant racial difference in the prevalence of migraine.21,22 In\ncontrast, others13 have reported similar prevalence rates in white and black women, while among men, the\nrate in blacks was significantly lower than that in whites. Unfortunately, this study13 included a very small\nnumber of blacks,\nMigraine has often been described as a disease of the more intelligent and upper socioeconomic\nclasses.13,23 Although no significant differences in frequency of migraine related to intelligence scores or\nsocioeconomic status were found, Waters23 believed that this perception was perpetuated by the higher use\nof medical services by those of higher social class and intelligence. The NHIS data reflect a higher\nprevalence of migraine in both low and high income households compared with middle income households.\nOther investigators have shown that migraine occurs at least as frequently in those of lower socioeconomic\nstatus as in those of higher status.13,24 The NHIS does reflect a higher prevalence of migraine in those with\nthe highest income compared to those of middle income level. However, the prevalence of migraine is striking\nin those with low household income.\nThe NHIS also showed that migraine occurred relatively less frequently in those whose educational\nattainment was at an elementary school level or less, and that generally, migraineurs achieved a higher\neducational level than the overall population. In females, the prevalence of migraine increased as the level of\neducation increased. The high prevalence of migraine in female college graduates (7.25%) and those with\npostgraduate training (9.68%) is noteworthy. It remains unclear how predictive level of education is of\nsocioeconomic status, as migraine prevalence was highest in those with low household income. Others have\nshown no association between the level of education and prevalence of migraine.9\nHealth Care Utilization.-About 85% of females and 77% of males sought medical attention at some point\nfor migraine; 8% of migraineurs were hospitalized for the disorder with some variation by age. Schnarch and\nHunter also found that about 71% of migrainous adults consulted a physician about their headache.7 In\ncontrast, other investigators showed that only 15% to 28% of respondents with headache sought medical\ncare.4,6 Notably, these were patients with all types of headache; the health-care seeking behavior of\nmigraineurs is unclear. In one of these studies,6 56% of those who sought medical care had frequent, severe\nheadaches, but it is not clear whether all of these patients were migraine sufferers. A more recent survey of\nmi-graineurs who had participated in a clinical trial showed that nearly half of the respondents (n=648)\nreported going to an emergency room or an urgent care center for treatment of their migraine in the previous\nyear.25 Over 90% of respondents reported clinic visits and 7% were hospitalized for treatment of migraine in\nthe previous year, approximating results found in the NHIS. An estimated $529,000 in migraine-related health\ncare resources were used by the 648 respondents over the course of a year, an average of $817 per\nLost Productivity.-Migraine resulted in a significant number of days of missed school or restricted activity.\nFemales accounted for the majority of these days. Previous studies have also shown that disability due to\nheadache, although not necessarily migraine headache, is substantial. Linet et al4 found that 4.5% of males\nand 10.6% of females reported missing part or more of a day of work or school because of headache in the\nfour weeks prior to being interviewed. Markush et al21 noted that 15.5% of young women indicated having\nheadaches that were usually severe enough to affect daily activities. Of those with migraine, 52.2% reported\ntheir headaches were severe enough to affect daily activities.21 Green found that migraine accounted for\nabsenteeism from work in approximately two-thirds of patients.26 Osterhaus et al25 also showed significant\ndisability due to migraine. Of the 56% of employed migraineurs who reported missing work due to migraine, a\nmean of 2.2 workdays per month were missed. Employed mi-graineurs worked a mean of 5.8 days per\nmonth with migraine and estimated that they were, on average, 57% effective when working with migraine\nsymptoms.25 The striking number of days of restricted activity experienced by housewives\nis also of great interest and has not been previously reported. This loss in productivity may affect childcare and maintenance of household in ways\nthat are not easily measured.\nCost of Lost Productivity.-The estimated annual cost to employers due to loss in productivity based on the NHIS is $1.4 billion for those\nmi-graineurs who worked. In a survey of migraineurs who had participated in a clinical trial, responses from-working migraineurs indicated that\nmigraine resulted in high lost labor costs in terms of missed workdays and days worked at reduced productivity due to migraine.25 Employers lost\nan estimated $1.4 to $1.9 million per year in labor costs for the 501 working migraineurs in this survey. Extrapolated to the US working migraine\npopulation, the annual estimates of lost labor costs ranged from $5 to $17 billion.25 The migraineurs in this study represented a more specific\npool, as they all met International Headache Society migraine diagnostic criteria. They may have had more disabling headaches, and, therefore,\nmore restricted activity and lost productivity than those in the general population.\nNonetheless, migraine prevalence is higher in females and increases with their educational level. Because females accounted for the majority\nof days of restricted activity, the financial impact of migraine will be compounded over subsequent years as women continue to enter the work force\nin greater numbers and as their earnings continue to increase. In addition, studies have shown that the prevalence17 and incidence2 of migraine in\nboth males and females are increasing rapidly in those under 45 years of age, the time when most are likely to be a part of the work force. These\nfactors will also serve to increase the cost of migraine to society.\nCONCLUSION\nMigraine is a relatively common disorder that affects females more often than males. Some racial, educational, and occupational differences in\nthose affected by migraine may also exist based on 1989 NHIS data. Migraine results in lost productivity due to days of restricted activity and\nconfinement to bed, costing employers and employees billions of dollars annually. These costs do not include those associated with health care for\nmigraine sufferers. Migraine occurs across all age groups, but the most commonly affected are those in the \"earning\" years (25 to 44 years of\nage), the time of maximum employment and productivity. Because the prevalence of migraine appears to be increasing, especially in those under\n45 years of age, additional societal costs due to lost productivity and increased utilization of health care services can be expected. Because it is\nunclear what proportion of migraine sufferers seek medical attention for their headache, more rigorous detection is necessary to adequately study\nthe full impact of this disease.\n"
