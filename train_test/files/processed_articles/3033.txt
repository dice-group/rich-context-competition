To better un-\nderstand why not, we examined the correlates of vari-\nous stages of help-seeking, including perceived need for\nprofessional help, seeking such help, and from which pro-\nfessionals participants sought help.\nMethods: The sample for this study comprised 1792 par-\nticipants in the National Comorbidity Survey, con-\nmonth DSM-III-R mood, anxiety, or substance disorder.\nIn this sample, we assessed correlates of perceived need\nfor professional help, seeking professional help among\nthose with a need, and, among those who did seek pro-\nfessional help, seeking help from mental health profes-\nsionals.\nResults: Mood disorders, comorbid mood and anxiety\ndisorders, and mental disorders associated with impair-\nment in role functioning or suicidality were strong pre-\ndictors of perceived need. Psychopathology was also as-\nsociated with the decision to seek help from mental health\nprofessionals, but not with the decision to seek profes-\nsional help overall. After controlling for the nature and\nseverity of psychopathology, various sociodemographic\nand attitudinal factors appeared to be associated with per-\nception of need, help-seeking, and participants' choices\nof professionals.\nConclusions: Unmet need for mental health care is a se-\nrious public health problem. Meeting this need requires\nexpanding our attention beyond psychopathology to vari-\nous evaluations and decisions that affect help-seeking.\nOur results suggest the importance of attitude and be-\nhavior change strategies in reducing the gap between need\nand care.\nPSYCHIATRIC epidemiological\nstudies repeatedly find that\nmost adults with mental dis-\norders receive no treat-\nment.1,2 This finding poses a\nconceptual problem concerning the rela-\ntionship between disorder and need for\ncare and a public health problem concern-\ning the need to define and address psy-\nchological, social, and economic barriers\nto care. One commonly used descriptive\nmodel,3 which explains service use in terms\nof the combined effects of predisposing fac-\ntors (eg, gender, education, and health be-\nliefs), enabling factors (eg, income, insur-\nance, and geographic access), and severity\nof illness, has only modest power to pre-\ndict whether individuals with mental dis-\norders will seek help.4-6\nStudies of illness identification and\nhelp-seeking generally follow 2 different\nstreams. First, epidemiological surveys,\nsuch as the Epidemiologic Catchment Ar-\neas study7 and National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey (NCS),8 are based on large represen-\ntative samples. They use structured\ninterviews to provide descriptive cross-\nsections of how disorder, help-seeking, and\nother factors are associated. In contrast,\nqualitative studies are typically based on\nlimited samples but use more intensive as-\nsessments with less standardized mea-\nsures.9,10 These studies make clear that the\nprocess of help-seeking has multiple\ntoms; attempt to evaluate the signifi-\ncance of their symptoms and the likely\nconsequences; determine whether they\nhave a problem that requires interven-\ntion and could benefit from treatment;\nevaluate the benefits and costs of various\ntreatments; and choose which health care\nproviders to consult. Different factors in-\nfluence each of these evaluations and de-\ncisions. The 2 approaches have comple-\nmentary strengths and weaknesses but are\nlogistically difficult to combine.13\nAs previous studies indicate, a key\nvariable when deciding whether to seek\nhelp is the perception of need.14-16 Many\nFrom the Department of\nPsychiatry, College of\nPhysicians and Surgeons,\nColumbia University, and the\nNew York State Psychiatric\nInstitute, New York City\n(Drs Mojtabai and Olfson);\nand the Institute of Health,\nHealth Care Policy, and Aging\nResearch, Rutgers University,\nNew Brunswick, NJ\n(Drs Mechanic and Olfson).\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

Alternatively, individuals may not\nperceive a need because they do not recognize their prob-\nlem as a mental health problem, do not know that ap-\npropriate help is available, believe that treatment will not\nhelp, do not find services accessible, are embarrassed about\nseeking help, fear stigmatization, or, in the case of se-\nvere psychotic disorders, lack insight into the pathologi-\ncal nature of their symptoms. In short, what appears to\nbe a simple objective report of perceived need is influ-\nenced by the social context and the decisions people make\nin response to symptoms. Understanding how per-\nceived need for professional help relates to a constella-\ntion of illness behavior variables helps structure pro-\ngrams that lead to appropriate care for those who need\nit most.\nIn this study, we used data from the NCS8 to exam-\nine correlates of different stages in the help-seeking pro-\ncess. We hypothesized that psychopathology is not the\nsole determinant of the help-seeking process and that vari-\nous psychosocial variables also determine whether indi-\nviduals seek help. To test this hypothesis, we examined\ncorrelates of perceived need among participants with psy-\nchiatric disorders, correlates of seeking professional help\namong those who perceived a need, and correlates of seek-\ning help from mental health professionals among those\nwho sought professional help.\nSAMPLE\nThe NCS is a multistage stratified survey of 8089 individu-\nals between the ages of 15 to 54 years who were selected\nfrom the noninstitutionalized household population of the\n48 coterminous states.8,17 The survey was administered be-\nsponse rate of 82.4%. Informed consent was obtained from\nall participants aged 18 years and older. For participants\nyounger than 18 years, informed consent was obtained from\nparents.\nThe NCS interview was composed of 2 parts. Part 1,\nadministered to all participants, included core diagnostic\nquestions covering all diagnoses included in the NCS ex-\ncept for nonaffective psychoses and posttraumatic stress dis-\norder. Part 2, which included questions about nonaffec-\ntive psychoses, posttraumatic stress disorder, and service\nuse, was administered to a probability subsample of 5877\nparticipants (all those identified as having a lifetime dis-\norder in part 1, all 15- to 24-year-olds, and a random sub-\nsample of other participants in part 1). In this study, we\nreport data on 1792 participants in part 2 who met the cri-\nteria for at least 1 common mood, anxiety, or substance dis-\norder. The data were weighted to adjust for differential prob-\nabilities of selection and differential nonresponse, and to\napproximate the cross-classification of the population dis-\ntribution on a range of sociodemographic characteris-\nASSESSMENTS\nHelp-seeking was defined in 2 ways. First, any voluntary\ncontact with a professional for emotional or substance use\nproblems was considered help-seeking. Contact was rated\nseparately for different types of professionals, including for-\nmal providers (such as mental health workers, general prac-\ntitioners, and other physicians) and informal providers (such\nas ministers, priests, spiritualists, and herbalists). How-\never, separate analyses limited to formal health care pro-\nviders produced similar results (data not shown). Second,\nany voluntary contact with psychiatrists, psychologists, or\nsocial workers was considered help-seeking from mental\nhealth professionals, even if the participant also reported\ncontact with other professionals. The timing of the partici-\npant's last contact with each professional was also noted,\nand we focused on contact made within the past 12 months.\nWe used a procedure described in earlier NCS analy-\nses16,19 to assess perceived need for professional help. For\nparticipants who had not seen a professional in the past 12\nmonths, perceived need was defined as a positive answer\nto the question: \"Was there ever a time during the past 12\nmonths when you felt that you might need to see a profes-\nsional because of problems with your emotions or nerves\nor your use of alcohol or drugs?\" For participants who had\nseen a professional, perceived need was assumed if they in-\ndicated that they had voluntarily contacted the profes-\nsional. Although reports of perceived need are subject to\nmemory and other distortions, limiting the recall period\nto the past 12 months may have reduced the likelihood of\nsuch errors.\nSociodemographic variables of age, race/ethnicity, and\neducation analyzed in this study were defined in a similar\nway as in earlier NCS reports.8,17 With regard to insurance\ncoverage, participants were divided into 3 categories: (1)\nthose covered by Medicaid, welfare, or any other public as-\nsistance; (2) those with a health insurance plan other than\nMedicaid that covered all or part of the costs for mental\nhealth care outside of a hospital; and (3) those who were\nnot covered by any plans, did not know if they were cov-\nered, or did not know the extent of their coverage. The cat-\negories are a crude indicator of insurance coverage that do\nnot consider the exact extent of coverage, presence of co-\ninsurance, or deductible amount, all of which can impose\nbarriers to care. Furthermore, individuals who had used\nservices may have been more likely to know about the ex-\ntent of coverage. Therefore, the effect of insurance on\nservice use may be a result, rather than a determinant, of\nutilization.\nThe diagnoses in NCS were based on a modified ver-\nsion of the World Health Organization's Composite Inter-\nnational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Based on informa-\ntion from these interviews, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R)20 life-\ntime and 12-month diagnoses were generated with the CIDI\ndiagnostic program. Data presented in this study are based\non the 12-month diagnoses, and 12 such diagnoses, grouped\nin 3 categories, were used in this study. The categories were\n(1) mood disorders, including major depression and dys-\nthymia; (2) anxiety disorders, including generalized anxi-\nety disorder, panic disorder, simple phobia, social phobia,\nagoraphobia with or without panic, and posttraumatic stress\ndisorder; and (3) substance use disorders, including alco-\nhol abuse, nonalcohol drug abuse, alcohol dependence, and\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nRESULTS\norders, 32% perceived a need for professional help in a\n12-month period. Distribution of perceived need was not\nuniform across diagnoses (Table 1). Participants with\ncomorbid mood and anxiety disorders with or without\ncomorbid substance disorders were about 3 times more\nlikely than participants with anxiety disorders alone to\nperceive a need for professional help. Substance disor-\nder without comorbidity was associated with the lowest\nrate of perceived need. Furthermore, substance disor-\nder comorbidity had different effects on mood disorders\nthan on anxiety disorders. Participants with comorbid\nmood and substance disorders were less likely than par-\nticipants with noncomorbid mood disorders to think they\nneeded help. In contrast, participants with comorbid anxi-\nety and substance disorders were more likely than those\nwith noncomorbid anxiety disorders to perceive a need.\nSuicidal ideation, plans, and attempts, and impair-\nment were also strongly associated with perceived need\nfor help (Table 2). In addition to psychiatric variables,\npositive attitude toward mental health help-seeking, physi-\ncal conditions, marital loss, female gender, younger age\ngroup (15-24 years), maternal psychopathology, and in-\nnonalcohol drug dependence. These categories are rather\nbroad and heterogeneous, particularly anxiety disorders,\nin which self-limited simple phobias are classified with the\nmore serious panic and posttraumatic stress disorders. To\nassess the impact of such categorization, we repeated the\nanalyses for diagnosis after excluding simple phobia (data\nnot shown). The results of these additional analyses were\nquite similar to those reported here.\nBipolar disorder and schizophrenia were not in-\ncluded in this study because of their low prevalence and\nuncertain validity in the NCS.21,22 The reliability and va-\nlidity of the CIDI diagnoses included in this study have been\nestablished in previous field trials23 and in clinical reap-\nThe level of impairment was evaluated by asking par-\nticipants to indicate how much their symptoms interfered\nwith their lives and activities on a scale ranging from \"not\nat all\" to \"a lot.\" Participants who stated symptoms caused\n\"a lot\" of interference with their lives and activities were\nconsidered severely impaired. This rating was done sepa-\nrately for every diagnosis, except for substance disorders\nand posttraumatic stress disorder.\nSuicidality was assessed with 3 sets of questions that\nasked whether the participant had ever thought about,\nplanned, or attempted suicide. If a question was answered\naffirmatively, follow-up questions assessed the timing of\nthe event. Only reports of suicide ideation, plans, or at-\ntempts in the past 12 months were used in this analysis.\nPhysical health status was assessed with 2 ratings. First,\nparticipants were asked: \"How would you rate your over-\nall physical health? Is it excellent, very good, good, fair, or\npoor?\" In this study, \"poor\" and \"fair\" self-ratings were com-\nbined and contrasted with the combined \"good,\" \"very\ngood,\" and \"excellent\" ratings. The second physical health\nvariable was based on a self-report of specific health con-\nditions over the past 12 months. Participants were asked\nto indicate specific conditions from a list with 14 catego-\nries. The list included musculoskeletal (eg, severe arthri-\ntis), respiratory (eg, severe asthma, tuberculosis), cardio-\nvascular (eg, heart attack), gastrointestinal (eg, ulcer),\nendocrine (eg, diabetes), and neurological (eg, multiple scle-\nrosis, epilepsy) disorders as well as cancer, acquired im-\nmunodeficiency syndrome, and other conditions.\nAttitudes toward mental health help-seeking were as-\nsessed by asking participants to respond to 3 hypothetical\nsituations: (1) whether the participant would seek help when\nfaced with a serious emotional problem; (2) how comfort-\nable he or she would feel talking about personal problems\nwith a professional; and (3) how embarrassing it would be\nif friends knew about the professional help. The answers\nwere ranked on a 4-point Likert scale (highly favorable to\nhighly unfavorable). The dichotomous rating of attitudes\nwas constructed by median split on the sum of the item\nscores.\nSupportive relationships were assessed separately for\nspouse or partner, relatives, and friends. Each relation-\nship was assessed with a 6-item scale. Items concerning par-\nticipants' relationships with their spouses or partners asked\nhow much the spouse really cared for the participant, un-\nderstood the way he or she felt about things, and appreci-\nated him or her; how much the participant could rely on\nthe spouse or partner for help with serious problems, could\nopenly talk to the spouse or partner about worries, and could\nrelax around the spouse or partner. Parallel items asked\nabout supportive relationships with relatives and friends\namong participants who had contact with these individu-\nals. Responses to each item were coded from 1 (not at all)\nto 4 (a lot). The dichotomous rating of social support was\nbased on median splits on summed scores.\nParental psychopathology was assessed with ques-\ntions about symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sub-\nstance use disorder. Each parent was addressed sepa-\nrately, and after each set of questions, participants were asked\nwhether their parents ever sought professional care or were\nhospitalized for psychiatric problems.\nWe conducted 3 sets of binary logistic regression analy-\nses. First, we examined correlates of perceived need. Sec-\nond, we examined correlates of help-seeking among par-\nticipants with a perceived need. Third, we examined\ncorrelates of seeking help from mental health profession-\nals among participants who had sought professional help.\nAnalyses were conducted once without any covariates (bi-\nvariate analyses) in the model and a second time adjusting\nfor the psychiatric variables of diagnosis, impairment, and\nsuicidality. A Cronbach  level of P .01 was used for all\nanalyses.\nFor the analyses reported here, we adopted a design-\nbased approach, in which frequency weights, strata, and\nprimary sampling units were used to adjust the parameter\nestimates and their variances.28 The Taylor series linear-\nlization method, as implemented in the \"svytab\" and \"svy-\nlogit\" routines of Stata 6.0 (Stata Co, College Station, Tex),\nwas used for these computations.\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

None of the psy-\nchiatric variables that predicted perceived need were sig-\nnificant correlates of help-seeking. Older age (45-54\nyears), having a physical condition, and positive atti-\ntudes toward mental health help-seeking were associ-\nated with seeking professional help (Table 2).\nFinally, of the 335 participants who sought professional\nhelp, 44% sought help from mental health profession-\nals. The nature and severity of psychopathology ap-\npeared to be an important predictor of help-seeking from\nmental health professionals. Individuals with comorbid\nanxiety and substance disorders and comorbid mood,\nanxiety, and substance disorders were more likely to con-\ntact mental health professionals. The majority of the par-\nticipants with comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance\ndisorders who sought professional help sought help from\nmental health care providers (Table 1). In contrast, less\nthan a third of all participants with noncomorbid anxi-\nety disorders who sought help did so from mental health\nprofessionals. For the analyses of help-seeking from men-\ntalhealthprofessionals,thenumberofparticipantsinsome\nof the diagnostic groups was rather small. Male gender,\npositive attitudes toward professional help, and insur-\nance coverage were also associated with seeking help from\nmental health professionals among those who had sought\nprofessional help (Table 2).\nCOMMENT\nIn interpreting these results, the limitations of this study\nand the NCS should be considered. First, for partici-\npants who had seen a professional, perceived need was\ninferred if they reported that they had voluntarily sought\nhelp. This measure of perceived need may not be as ac-\ncurate as a direct question. However, it is reassuring that\nparticipants who perceived a need but did not seek care\nwere indistinguishable from those who sought care with\nregard to the nature and severity of psychopathology, the\nstrongest correlates of perceived need in our study. Sec-\nond, our analyses were limited to individuals with an NCS\ndiagnosis of a mental disorder. Another important ques-\ntion is the extent and correlates of perceived need and\nhelp-seeking among individuals who did not have a di-\nagnosis. Additional analyses indicated that participants\nwithout diagnoses are less likely to perceive a need than\nparticipants with diagnoses (10% vs 32%). After perceiv-\ning a need, however, they are as likely to seek care (61%\nvs 59%), although they are less likely to seek care from\nmental health professionals (28% vs 44%). The corre-\nlates of perceived need were similar in subjects with and\nwithout diagnoses (data not shown). Thus, diagnosis is\nassociated with perceived need and help-seeking from\nmental health professionals, but not with help-seeking\nin general after perceiving need. Third, both the assess-\nment of perceived need and help-seeking in the NCS were\nbased on 12-month recall. A shorter recall period might\nhave produced more accurate results.\nPrevious studies of perceived need and help-\nseeking provide context for our findings.29-34 Of these,\nthe Ontario Health Survey29 used methods similar to the\nNCS. Comparison of the 2 surveys revealed that more\npeople in the United States than in Ontario, Canada, per-\nceived a need for help and used services. After control-\nling for perceived need, most of the between-country varia-\ntions in service use disappeared. Thus, perceived need\nexplains variations in service use across as well as within\nsettings.\nSimilar to previous studies, we found higher rates\nof perceived need among women30-33; participants who\npants with physical problems33; and younger partici-\ntion between these variables and help-seeking after need\nwas established30,31 and a higher likelihood of help-\nseeking after need was felt among the middle-aged.30-32\nFew studies, primarily surveys done several de-\ncades ago,30,31 have examined perceived need for profes-\nTable 1.

Some more recent stud-\nies of service use have also noted relationships between\neducation or minority status and the likelihood of men-\ntal health visits.35,36 Unlike these studies, we did not find\nperceived need or help-seeking associated with educa-\ntion, race, or income. Most previous analyses were based\non general population samples, not specifically persons\nwith psychiatric diagnoses. It is noteworthy, however,\nTable 2.

This\nfinding may reflect increased recognition of mental ill-\nness among the offspring of parents with psychiatric dis-\norders or less willingness to rely on informal support net-\nworks as a result of childhood experiences.\nInterestingly, few of the correlates of perceived need\npredicted help-seeking among individuals who per-\nceived a need. The nonsignificant effects of psychiatric\nvariables are, perhaps, as noteworthy as the significant\neffects. After the need for professional help is perceived,\nthe nature and severity of psychopathology do not affect\nthe decision to seek help. The major determinants of help-\nseeking among individuals with a perceived need for pro-\nfessional help are sociodemographic and attitudinal.\nThe nature and severity of psychopathology, how-\never, did affect the choice of care providers. Individuals\nwith more severe comorbid disorders38 were more likely\nto seek care from mental health professionals. This sug-\nTable 2.

All rights reserved.\ngests progress toward a targeted care system in which the\nmore severely ill seek help from the more specialized pro-\nfessionals and the less severely ill from nonspecialized\nprofessionals.\nOne of the explanations proposed for the mis-\nmatch between the rates of mental disorders in the com-\nmunity and rates of help-seeking is that the rates of dis-\norders are exaggerated and do not reflect the true need\nfor care.39 The results of the present study provide par-\ntial support for this hypothesis. A majority of individu-\nals with less severe or impairing psychopathology may\nhave recognized the self-limited nature of their prob-\nlems and did not perceive a need for professional help.\nHowever, many of the individuals with disorders who\ndo not perceive a need experience distress and impair-\nment and could potentially benefit from professional help.\nIn this sample, for example, 26% of participants who met\nthe criteria for 1 of the disorders in the study but who\ndid not perceive a need for professional help reported se-\nvere impairment in their daily activities. Furthermore,\nabout 5% reported suicidal ideation, plans, or attempts\nduring the past year. Thus, experiencing a need for pro-\nfessional help is not a direct response to distress and im-\npairment, and even after controlling for distress and im-\npairment, various sociodemographic and attitudinal\nfactors affect both perceived need and help-seeking. The\neffects of these sociodemographic and attitudinal fac-\ntors reflect the complex evaluations and decisions that\ncharacterize \"illness behavior.\"40\nas illustrated here, can inform interventions that seek to\nachieve a better correspondence between need and use\nof appropriate services. Strategies aimed at changing at-\ntitudes and motivating help-seeking are essential for en-\ncouraging persons with disabling conditions who do not\nperceive a need for professional care to use services. There\nis some limited evidence that screening and targeted edu-\ncational campaigns affect attitudes43-45 and help-seeking\nbehavior.46-48 However, we believe that it is essential to\ngo beyond such efforts and seek to integrate motiva-\ntional and cognitive aspects of behavior change with spe-\nResults from our study also point to some groups that\nare less likely to express a need for professional help when\nexperiencing psychiatric problems.

Many of the barriers to care at this stage, how-\never, are objective barriers such as financial problems or\nthe time costs of care.
