    "abstract": "Abstract: For more than 5000 years, people have cultivated flowers although there is\nno known reward for this costly behavior. In three different studies we show that\nflowers are a powerful positive emotion \"inducer\". In Study 1, flowers, upon\npresentation to women, always elicited the Duchenne or true smile. Women who\nreceived flowers reported more positive moods 3 days later. In Study 2, a flower\ngiven to men or women in an elevator elicited more positive social behavior than\nother stimuli. In Study 3, flowers presented to elderly participants (55+ age) elicited\npositive mood reports and improved episodic memory. Flowers have immediate and\nlong-term effects on emotional reactions, mood, social behaviors and even memory\nfor both males and females. There is little existing theory in any discipline that\nexplains these findings. We suggest that cultivated flowers are rewarding because\nthey have evolved to rapidly induce positive emotion in humans, just as other plants\nhave evolved to induce varying behavioral responses in a wide variety of species\nleading to the dispersal or propagation of the plants.\n",

Few\nscientists have taken this hypothesis seriously and few studies question the effect that\nflowering plants or other non-humans, (except dogs; Allen, 2003) have on human\nemotions. Do flowering plants, in fact, increase positive emotional reaction by\ninfluencing emotional displays such as smiling or, over a longer time period, do they\nchange moods and also influence socio-emotional functions such as social greeting\npatterns or memories of social events? The following studies of social-emotional\nresponses to flowers begin to examine this proposition and to question the human\nemotional environment outside that of human relationships.\nAlthough we know that depriving humans or other social species of species-\nspecific social contact and emotional support is detrimental to health (Cacioppo et al.,\n2000; Spitz, 1946), very little research has been directed to the effects of depriving\nhumans of other-species sources for emotional support. Humans are embedded in a\nlarger sensory and social environment than that occupied by their own species.\nDepriving humans of non-species emotional support may be as detrimental to human\nsurvival and fitness as depriving humans of any other resource.\nA Brief History\nIn cultures around the world as far back in history as we have any records,\nflowers provided emotional information among peoples. Pollen was found in the\ngraves of Neanderthals suggesting that the flowers had a place in the burial (Solecki,\n1971), although the significance of the pollen is still in dispute (Sommer, 1999).\nFlowers are expected to convey sympathy, contrition (guilt), romance (sexual intent)\nor celebration (pride and joy) (Heilmeyer, 2001). Flowers are also used to express\nreligious feelings and in some religions are considered the direct route for spiritual\ncommunication. (Stenta, 1930). Of course, some flowers are used for personal\nadornment, both the blossoms themselves and their essences in the form of perfumes.\nThe vast majority of personal commercial fragrances have a floral top- and/or mid-\nnote. In spite of some basic survival uses, such as edible or medicinal flowers, most\nflowering plants grown in the flower industry in modern times are not used for any\npurpose other than emotional. Floriculture crops in the United States accounted for at\nunderestimates the floral economy because it does not include imports.\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nNaive psychology argues that flowers are desired because of learned\nassociations with social events. However, the ubiquity of flower use across culture\nand history and the lack of easy substitutes for the many uses of flowers suggest that\nthere may be something other than this simple association. Flowers may influence\nsocial-emotional behavior more directly or may prime such behavior. That is,\nflowering plants may have adapted to an emotional niche.\nThe Emotional Niche \u00ad Both the Positive and the Negative\nCan one really argue that positive emotion usually has survival benefits or\nconveys reproductive fitness? Despite early definitions of happiness or joy as a basic\nemotion, the continuing science of the evolution of emotion has emphasized the\nnegative -- hostile and fearful emotions in animals and depression and hostility in\nhumans (McGuire, 1993). A larger research literature reports on the stimuli that\ngovern negative emotions as well as the patterns of response, secondary effects, and\nindividual differences that emerge in their expression (for reviews, see Lewis and\nHaviland-Jones, 2000). It is clear that both plants and animals use defenses that elicit\nemotional fear or disgust reactions through the sensory modes of taste and smell,\nvision and audition. Snakes and spiders are not necessarily poisonous and the\nstinking, slimy mushroom may even be edible. It is not necessary that defense\nmechanisms be physically damaging, only that they produce an emotional reaction\nleading to avoidance or withdrawal. A plant or animal that can frighten or disgust a\npredator has gained fitness by exploiting an emotional niche. Withdrawal without\nphysical contact is better than an active physical defense, which might lead to damage\nor death of the defending species. The ability to produce negative avoidant emotion in\na predator has long been considered a possible defense and could be seen as the\nexploitation of an emotional niche.\nThat positive emotion could operate in a similar emotional niche has emerged\nAttraction mechanisms for plants have some socio-emotional features. For example,\nHawk moths (Manduca species.) repeatedly visit Datura flowers (jimsonweed) for a\nhallucinogenic reward (Grant and Grant, 1983). Some species of orchids produce\nvery little nectar and attract pollinators with perfumes. Orchid bees (Eulaema,\nEuplusia and Euglossa genera) collect perfumes/pheromones from these orchids into\nspecialized pouches; they then use the perfumes as sex attractants. Other species of\norchids mimic female sex pheromones and attract males who mate with the flower\n(Scheistl, et al., 1999). Interestingly, after \"mating\" the flowers then produce an anti-\naphrodisiac pheromone (Schiestl and Ayasse, 2001). The well-known bower bird\ndecorates its nest with flowers (Uy and Borgia, 2000). A number of bat-pollinated\nflowers emit a sulfur-like odor that mimics odors used in bat mating and social\nrecognition (von Helversen, Winkler, and Bestmann, 2000). Many other plants\nprovide non-nutritional chemical compounds, which insects can use for defense or\nsexual attraction (Weller, Jacobson, and Conner, 2000). There does not appear to be\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\na demonstration of plants providing socio-emotional benefits using similar chemical\nor visual mechanisms to humans.\nThe attraction to flowering plants reflected above may be related to positive\nemotion. Panskepp's (2000b) research suggests that non-human species use positive\nemotion similarly to humans. \"Tickling\" rodents elicits high pitched \"laughter.\" This\nlaughter is related to the appropriate neurological patterns for positive emotion, and is\nattractive to other members of the same species. Rats will prefer to approach a\nhuman caretaker who is a \"tickler\" over one who provides food and water. In other\nwords, the immediate elicitation and expression of emotion even coming from\nanother species is related to secondary social attraction effects. The secondary effects\nof positive emotion are demonstrated in a large number of behavioral domains for\npeople as well as for rodents (Panksepp, 2000a). Positive emotion makes people\nappear to be more attractive, even sexually attractive and arguably, more likely to be\napproached socially. (Cunningham, Barbee, and Philhower, 2002; Otta, Abrosio, and\nBoth short and long-term expressions of positive emotion are related to\nsecondary effects of positive mood. For example, cognitive processing that is\ninclusive and exploratory (Isen, 1987) often accompanies or follows positive\nexpressions. Positive mood also improves memory processes (Isen, 1999; Levine and\nBurgess, 1997) and serves as a buffer against stress. Those who are induced to be\npositive will recover more rapidly from stressors (Folkman and Moskowitz, 2000;\nFredrickson, 2000). Also, the long-term expression of positive moods leads to a\nprolonged involvement in an ongoing activity, and several researchers have argued\nthat happiness is related to feelings of safety and would therefore be associated with\nsocial gathering and caring for infants (for reviews see Ekman and Davidson, 1994).\nFinally, happy people are more likely to get married, thereby establishing families\nThus, happiness in humans facilitates both immediate and long-term social\n2000a) and may lead to long-term survival benefits. Health benefits are often\ndocumented in laboratory studies of animals other than humans. For example, Poole\n(1997) suggests that unhappy animals are often physiologically and immunologically\nabnormal, and Hockly et al. (2002) found that the environmental enrichment of lab\nmice slowed the progression of Huntington's chorea in genetically engineered mice.\nEnvironmental enrichment also is known to upregulate genes involved with neuronal\ngrowth (Rampon et al., 2000). There is a growing body of evidence supporting the\nneed for a positive emotional environment for optimal health, social and cognitive\nprocesses. If positive emotion has these effects, then human emotional needs are a\nniche to which other species can adapt.\nIf flowering plants are exploiting a human emotional niche, it must be shown\nthat they directly influence emotional states and thereby, also beneficially influence\nsecondary cognitive and social behaviors. It is the goal of our research studies to\ndemonstrate that some plants, notably domesticated flowers, have a strong effect on\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nemotional state and influence secondary cognitive and social behaviors.\nMeasurement of Positive Emotion\nThe measurement of emotion, particularly positive emotion, is reliably done\nin several ways. Positive expressive movements among humans are reliably measured\nwith facial movement, particularly smiles. The smile is the easiest facial movement to\nrecognize. This is especially important when the movement is brief and embedded in\nongoing activity. Self-reports of moods are also reliable when longer mood states are\nmeasured.\nThe Duchenne smile is consistently related to positive emotion in humans and\nis a reliable indicator of happiness, whether or not the happiness can be self-reported\n(Dimberg, Thunberg, and Elmehed, 2000). For example, Messinger, Fogel and\nDickson (2001) showed that the Duchenne smile is associated with reciprocal positive\nemotion because it is displayed by infants when their mothers are also smiling.\nWilliams et al (2001) argue that the Duchenne smile elicits a hardwired reciprocal\nresponse in observers. The Duchenne smile functions both as a shared\ncommunication as well as an individual response to positive stimuli. It is a reliable\nindicator of the ability of a stimulus to elicit immediate positive emotion.\nIn the course of research on fear stimuli Dimberg and Thell (1988) used\npictures of snakes for fear stimuli, and pictures of flowers for neutral stimuli. They\nfound that flowers were not neutral but had effects on rapid changes in facial\nmusculature. They reported that the facial EMG reaction to the flower stimuli is\nzygomatic muscle activity (smile), which they refer to as a positive response.\nDimberg and Thell did not conclude that the study participants exposed to the flower\npicture were happy because a genuine, or \"true\" smile (the Duchenne smile) also\nrequires orbicularis oris movement (movement around the eye), which they did not\nmeasure. It is possible that they inadvertently discovered a positive emotional\nstimulus in flowers. This immediate response needs to be tested with further study of\nthe facial response to determine whether the response is indeed the Duchenne smile.\nThis will be one of the first tests we use in Study 1.\nIf people respond to cultivated flowers with a Duchenne smile, it would be a\nstrong indicator that flowers are an immediate stimulus for positive emotions. Then if\ninterviews and self-reports corroborate the positive effects, this is evidence for long\nterm or secondary effects on mood.\nGoals of the Studies\nIn the following studies we first (Study 1) compare the emotional influence of\ncultivated flowers with that resulting from comparable objects which supply more\nbasic needs such as food or warmth. We predict that the influence of cultivated\nflowers on human mood should be powerful both immediately and long term. To\nmeasure immediate emotional change we observe smiling behaviors; to measure\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nlonger-term mood change we measure mood before receiving a floral bouquet and 3\ndays afterwards.\nIn Study 1 we use only female participants; however, if the flowering plants\nfill a human emotional niche, the effect should, at least partly, overcome local social\nconvention such as gender. Though women are the usual recipients of flowers in 21st\nCentury North America and thought to be more responsive to flowers, this may be\nrelated to the perception (or bias) that women are more emotionally responsive\ngenerally (Brody and Hall, 2000). Such a bias only reinforces the hypothesis that\nflowers influence emotion, but does not eliminate the possibility that men can be\ninfluenced similarly. In Study 2 we hypothesize that the positive emotional effects of\nflowers should generalize to men. Finally, if the effect on emotional state is\npowerful, we predict that the moods produced by cultivated flowers would have\npositive effects on social behaviors. In Study 2 we measure emotional and social\nbehavior in a naturalistic observation.\nThe goal of Study 3 is to expand our information about secondary effects to\nthe cognitive area. It also examines the long-term impact of repeated exposure to\nflowers (i.e. the dose effect). In the third study we provide people living in senior\nliving residences with flowers. We predict that the flowers will have both a long-\nterm effect and a short-term effect on mood. Further we predict that the secondary or\nspiraling mood changes will influence social behavior and episodic memory.\nStudy 1 \u00ad Immediate Smiles and Long Term Mood Change\nTo test the effects of flowers, we compared the immediate and long-term\nemotional behavior of participants who received floral bouquets to the behavior of\nparticipants who were presented with flower-irrelevant control stimuli.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants were 147 adult women evenly distributed across three age\n\"African Americans\", 5 were \"Asian Americans\", and 3 were \"other\". Women were\nchosen for several reasons: (1) they are more facially expressive, making the coding\nof their immediate emotional response more reliable; (2) they are more likely to\nreport shifts in moods, especially negative moods (Brody and Hall, 2000) and (3)\nwomen are the more common recipients of flowers in the local culture. The\nparticipants were recruited through alumnae newsletters, newspaper advertisements\nand postings in grocery stores and churches in the New York-New Jersey\nMetropolitan Area.\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nStimuli\nThe mixed-flower bouquet (including roses, lilies and stocks) was chosen\nafter consultation with the Society of American Florists about the most popular\nbouquets. A mixed-flower bouquet has a variety of colors and odors and should\nmaximize the effect across a diverse group of participants. An initial focus group of\n15 women, ages similar to those of the experimental participants, listed stimuli that\ncould substitute for flowers. This initial group was joined by an additional 15 women\nand these 30 women rated all the stimuli on similarity to flowers. The focus groups\nselected (1) a fruit and sweets basket (food) and (2) a large, multi-wicked candle\n(light, heat) on a stand. The selected stimuli had some of the traditional traits of\ndomesticated plants -- food and fuel. Chocolate sweets were not selected because\nratings were split, either very high (desirable) or very low (undesirable due to\nallergies or weight consciousness). The selected stimuli were uniformly rated high.\nThe stimuli all had the same economic value, had some pleasant odor, had variation\nin color, and were wrapped similarly for presentation in clear plastic with colorful\nbows.\nMeasures\nMood Measures. The 24-item Differential Emotion Scale (DES)-long form\n(Izard, 1971) is divided into 8 subscales representing 8 primary emotions. Each item\nexpresses a feeling, such as \"felt like what you're doing or watching is interesting.\"\nThe DES was developed to measure changes in normal moods rather than\ndysfunctional ones. A participant was asked to indicate how often she had felt \"each\nof these feelings\" in the past 2-4 days, ranging from \"0\" (Never) to \"4\" (very often).\nThe Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS; Diener and Larson, 1984) is a 5-item scale\nincluding statements such as \"So far, I have gotten the important things I want in\nlife.\" The participant was asked to indicate the extent of her agreement with each\nstatement on a 5-point bipolar scale ranging from \"Strongly disagree\" to \"Strongly\nagree.\"\nAssessment of Secondary Behaviors. A series of open-ended questions\nassessed the possible influence of the floral bouquets on secondary behaviors. During\nthe last interview, participants rated the extent and type of social support they had\nexperienced within the last 2-3 days. These included questions about intimate\ncontacts (i.e., people with whom participants had close relationships such as family or\nfriends), relaxation activities, creative activities, and amusements. This interview\nalso included questions about the placement of the stimulus in the home and the use\nof the stimulus.\nCoding the Immediate Positive Emotion. In the first 5 sec after presentation\nof the stimulus, the coder recorded the presence of (a) the Duchenne smile\n(zygomatic and orbicularis oris movement), or (b) the zygomatic smile alone (no\nmovement of the muscle orbiting the eye) or (c) no smile. The duration of the\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nmovements within the 5 sec was not coded, only their occurrence. These facial\nmuscles are easily discerned and coded even by untrained people. With training, the\ncoding is highly reliable (Ekman, Friesen, and Davidson, 1990; Frank, Ekman, and\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited for a study about normal daily moods. At initial\ncontact, participants answered demographic questions and scheduled the delivery of\nthe stimulus to their homes. They were told they would receive a gift for their\nparticipation, one of 10 possibilities, but were not told which one. All participants\nagreed to be interviewed by phone three times, including the initial contact. Both\ninterviewers and participants were blind to the stimuli.\nInitial Interview Prior to Stimulus. About 10 days before the presentation of\nthe stimulus, the participant was interviewed by an experimenter who had no\nknowledge of which stimulus would be given to that participant. The experimenter\nasked the participant to respond to items on both the DES and the LSS.\nStimulus Delivery. Two experimenters delivered the stimuli to the homes of\nthe participants on a prearranged schedule. One presented the stimulus and the other\ncoded the type of smile. The presentation was double blind -- blind to the participant\nuntil the moment of presentation and to the coder before and during the presentation.\nThe person holding the box with the stimulus had her entire upper body and face\nblocked by the box so she was unlikely to give any cue as to the contents. The\nstimulus was in a large box with one open side. This side was turned away from the\nparticipant and from the coder. When the participant had her attention on the box, the\nopen side was turned towards her but the contents were still not visible to the coder.\nThis method of presentation allowed us to focus on the response activated by the\nstimulus rather than the response to the delivery people. The coder noted the type of\nsmile in the initial 4-5 seconds after the stimulus was uncovered.\nFollow-up Interviews. The second interview occurred 2-4 days after the\ndelivery of the stimulus. The interviewer was neither a coder nor a presenter of the\nstimuli and remained blind to which stimulus the participant had received. The\nparticipant again responded to the DES and the LSS. This interview also included\nopen-ended questions to assess social support as a possible secondary effect and to\ndetermine use of the stimulus.\nResults\nImmediate emotional reaction\nIn the 5 sec following the presentation of the stimulus, 100% of the\nparticipants in the flower group responded with the Duchenne smile indicating\nhappiness. The Duchenne smile was common in response to all the stimuli but there\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nwas some variation in response to the other stimuli; 10% of participants receiving\nfruit and 23% of participants receiving the candle did not respond with a Duchenne\nsmile. The differences between the groups is very significant (2 (2, N = 147) =\n14.21, p = .007). There were age-related preferences to the control items. Older\nparticipants were more likely to display the Duchenne smile when presented with\ndifferences were marginally significant. Younger participants were more likely to\naware during interviews that some participants preferred another stimulus. However,\nstated preferences apparently had no effect on the universal Duchenne response to the\nflowers.\nMood Interviews\nAll groups of participants showed an expected decline in the intensity of\nemotions from the first interview to the second. All ts on negative emotion were\ngreater than 2.02; all ps were less than .05; there were only marginal effects for\npositive emotions (see Diener and Larson, 1984, on retesting moods). Only the\nParticipants who received the flowers reported an increase in positive emotion on the\nAll three groups had higher scores on the LSS at the second interview than at\nsignificant interaction by stimuli.\nDuring the second interview we also asked questions about the use of the\nstimuli. The flowers were at least twice as likely to be placed in communal space, that\nis, places such as the foyer, the living room or dining room. Flowers were not very\nlikely to be placed in the most private spaces such as baths, bedrooms or inside\ncupboards, whereas the other stimuli were more likely to be in private space than in\nflowers were more likely than those receiving the other stimuli to answer positively to\nsocial support questions (e.g. contacting people, talking intimately) after they\nthere were no changes in responses to questions about engaging in amusements or\nrelaxation. These results from the interviews suggest that the flowers influence\nsecondary socio-emotional behaviors as well as having a strong effect on immediate\nemotional behavioral expression. However, these were post-hoc analyses requiring\nfurther study.\nDiscussion\nThe Duchenne smile is common on the presentation of all the stimuli as\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nexpected; however, the highest (100%) response rate occurred to flowers. The only\nlonger term increase in positive moods reported was for those who received flowers.\nThere were additional indications that flowers were different from other stimuli.\nFollow-up interviews indicated that people who received flowers placed them in\ncommunal spaces more often and slightly changed their social behavior.\nStudy 2 \u00ad Social Behavior and Flowers: The Elevator Study\nIn Study 1, we only included female participants and we only observed one\nbehavior, the smile. It appeared from post-hoc analyses that a broader range of social\nbehaviors might be affected. To expand and confirm the results, in Study 2 we\nincluded men as well as women as recipients of flowers. We collected data on the\nDuchenne smile and other social indicators such as proximity and initiation of\nconversation. We believed it would be difficult to obtain self-reports of any positive\neffect of flowers on men in this society when flowers are viewed as very feminine\nand are seldom presented to men. In the second study we observed Participants being\nhanded single flowers or an alternate stimulus in a constrained social situation - an\nelevator. The norms for social distance are well established (see Hall, 1966; Sussman\nand Rosenfeld, 1982), and this is certainly true of public spaces (Burgess, 1983)\nincluding elevators. Popular knowledge suggests that the most typical behavior for\nelevators that are sparsely occupied is for strangers to retreat to opposite corners. We\npredicted that the smile would occur more for the flower while social distance would\ndecrease, and that the behavior of men and women would be comparable.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 122 individuals (60 males, 62 females) who entered a\nuniversity library elevator alone. Because of the study's focus on naturalistic\nobservation, participants were not made aware that they were being observed. Thus,\nno age or ethnicity data were obtained; however, the ages of people in a university\nlibrary will tend to be towards the early 20s, but not exclusively. In this large East\nCoast University, there are representatives of many ethnic groups.\nStimuli\nBy random assignment, participants were observed in one of four conditions.\n(1) In the flower condition, participants received one Gerber Daisy. Gerber or\nTransvaal daisies are characterized by bold colors and blooms 4-5\" across, although\nthere is little odor. (2) In the exposure condition, participants were exposed to a\nbasket of Gerber Daisies, but did not receive anything. (3) In the alternate stimulus\ncondition, participants were not exposed to flowers, but received a pen with a\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nuniversity inscription. (4) In the no-exposure condition, participants were not exposed\nto flowers, nor did they receive anything; neither a basket nor a sign were present.\nFlowers and pens were always held in a flat basket. A sign was attached to the\nbasket, \"Free Flowers/Gift! The Society of American Florists Supports a Random Act\nof Kindness Day! People will be receiving flowers/gifts at random, on the elevator.\nYou can pass on the kindness!\" In the pen condition, the sign did not include a\nreference to the Society of American Florists.\nMeasures\nFacial Reaction. At any time after the participant entered the elevator, the\nfemale experimenter could note a smile. As in Study 1, three types were recorded: (a)\nno smile, assigned a value of 0; (b) a polite smile, involving zygomatic muscle\nmovement but no movement of the muscle orbiting the eye, assigned a value of 1;\nand (c) a Duchenne smile, involving both zygomatic and orbicularis oris movement,\nassigned a value of 2. Experimenters returned smiles but did not initiate them. The\nsmile with the highest rating was the only one recorded.\nProxemic Behavior. After the elevator began moving, the participant's\nproximity to the experimenter was recorded. This was the farthest position taken by\nthe participant after the conversation was initiated and the participant stopped moving\ninto the elevator. The elevator floor was divided into five semi-circular sections with\nvery small grid marks using clear tape, radiating out from the experimenter's location\nby the elevator button. The grid marks were easily visible to the experimenters who\nhad placed them but were not likely to be noticed by others. Grid 5 was designated as\nthe area where participants may have touched the experimenter; grid 1 was when the\nparticipant leaned on the farthest wall in the corner of the elevator. The grids were\narranged 24 inches apart. Proximity was coded on a scale from 1 (farthest away) to 5\n(closest or touched experimenter) according to the participant's location in the\nelevator.\nInitiation of Conversation. After the initial comments made by the\nexperimenter, any conversation initiated by the participant was coded. Superficial\nremarks such as \"Thank you\" or \"A flower?\" were not coded as initiated speech but\ntreated as a response to the experimenter. If the participant initiated conversation\nbeyond the experimenter's first greeting, a value of 1 was assigned for conversation\ninitiation; if not, a 0 was assigned. Experimenters responded politely but briefly.\nEye gaze/head orientation. Experimenters noted whether participants were\ndirecting their gaze toward them by noting head orientation, recording this as toward\nthe experimenter or away/up/down. Again this was noted in the same time frame as\nthe proximity rating \u00ad after the elevator moved and after the first response to the\nexperimenter. If the experimenter observed gaze at or in the direction of the\nexperimenter's face from the participant, a value of 1 was assigned for the presence\nof an eye gaze, otherwise, a value of 0 was assigned.\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nTotal Social Score (TSS). Individual scores for (a) type of smile, (b)\nconversation initiation, (c) proximity to the experimenter, and (d) gaze/head\norientation to experimenter were summed to obtain a Total Social Score (TSS) which\nserved as the main dependent variable for the experiment (Cronbach's  = .70,\nindicating adequate reliability). The possible range for TSS was from 1 to 9.\nProcedure\nOnly one stimulus condition was run per day. On those days when\nflowers/stimulus were presented, flower/stimulus presentation and flower/stimulus\nexposure/no presentation were alternated. An individual who entered the elevator\nbecame a participant if s/he entered the elevator alone.\nTwo experimenters were present. A male experimenter held the basket and\npositioned himself next to the elevator control panel. A female experimenter stood\nnext to him holding a clipboard for recording data. The experimenters' placement in\nthe elevator did not vary. In the flower/stimulus presentation conditions, the male\nexperimenter initiated conversation according to a pre-constructed script. He also\nhanded the flower or pen to the participant. In the exposure/no presentation and\ncontrol conditions, he said: \"Hi, which floor would you like?\" After this brief\nquestion or stimulus presentation, the experimenters did not speak except in response\nto the participant. The female experimenter recorded proximity, conversation, facial\nmovement, and eye contact on a standardized coding sheet. If a participant asked the\nfemale experimenter what she was writing, she responded that she was keeping a\nrecord of gift recipients for the Society of American Florists. This gave participants\nthe opportunity to request that nothing be recorded about them.\nResults\nTSS Scores\nA 4 (condition) x 2 (gender) analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a highly\nExamination of the means by group indicates that the highest levels of social\nbehaviors were displayed in the flower-receiving condition, followed by the pen-\nreceiving condition, the no stimulus condition, and finally the flower-exposure\ncondition.

Thus, while receiving an\nobject from a stranger elicits eye contact regardless of the type of stimulus, it was\nflowers alone that elicited a higher level of social behaviors including type of smile,\nproximity, and initiation of conversation.\nDiscussion\nContrary to cultural expectation, both men and women presented with flowers\n(as opposed to a pen or with nothing) were more likely to smile, to stand at a social\ndistance rather than at an impersonal distance and to initiate conversation. Men are\nnot expected to prefer flowers, yet they show the same pattern of smiling and\napproach in Study 2 as women. The prediction that the mere presence of flowers\nwould be positive was not supported. The field notes suggest that participants were\ndisappointed not to have received a flower. We had two cases of individuals in this\ncondition returning to the elevator and asking for a flower. A better test of the\npresence of flowers that is not contaminated with such expectations is needed.\nWhile the presentation of flowers seems to have more effect on behavior than\ncomparable stimuli, it is possible that this is a very short-term effect. In Study 3, we\ntest the effects of repeated exposure to flowers. We also expand the potential\ninfluence of the positive affect induced to include cognitive consequences.\nStudy 3 \u00ad Secondary Effects of Flowers on Senior Retirees: Social and Cognitive\nConsequences\nWhile the presentation of flowers seems to have important socio-emotional\neffects on behavior, it is possible that this is largely due to the unusual experimental\npresentation. People in Study 3 receive two, one or no flower bouquets over a 2-\nweek period. To follow up the social effects seen in the previous studies, in this third\nstudy we asked participants to keep daily diaries of social interactions. We also\npredicted secondary effects of the flowers on cognitive function. If there are\ngeneralizing effects of the flowers on moods, then they might affect episodic memory\nas well as sociability. Depression is known to have negative effects both on social\ninteraction (Reifler, 1994) and on memory (Backman et al., 2000; Gotlib, Roberts,\nand Gilboa , 1996; Watts, 1995). If negative mood or depression is responsive to\nflowers, then we predict that there are both social and cognitive secondary effects\nrelated to the positive mood increases.\nTo further demonstrate the predicted secondary effects of flowers on moods,\nwe used a participant population of senior retirees. In this population generally, the\nrate of depression is underreported (Friedhoff, 1994), withdrawal from social events\noccurs as a result of such depression (Reifler, 1994) and there is a general decline in\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe recruited 113 participants (93 women and 10 men). Their average age\nThe oldest person giving her exact age was 93 (many declined to give exact ages).\nAmong these, 104 completed the interview part of the study and 91 also completed\nand mailed the daily logs. Dropping out usually occurred because of a death in the\nfamily or illness (no participants died during the study). We removed one participant\nwhose materials had been completed by a relative. Most of the sample was\nEuropean-American (90), but there were also 7 Asian-Americans, 4 African-\nAmericans, one Native American and 3 \"other\". Participants were recruited from\nretirement communities, from community centers offering programs for seniors,\nthrough community video announcements and through postings in stores, churches,\nand alumni newsletters.\nStimuli\nAll participants received at least one bouquet, which was identical to the most\npopular bouquet in Study 1. One group received a second bouquet. The second\nbouquet was composed of mixed flowers but was monochromatic yellow.\nParticipants were assigned to one of four stimulus conditions. (1) In the primary\nstimulus condition, the early group, participants received bouquets only the first\nweek, 2-3 days after the baseline interview (to assess the long-term deterioration of\nthe flower effect). (2) In the delayed stimulus condition, the late group, participants\nreceived bouquets only the second week, 2-3 days after the second interview (to\nassess stability of moods and the addition of flowers to the environment). Together,\nthese two groups were the \"one flower\" group. (3) In the repeated stimulus condition,\nthe \"all flowers\" group, participants received bouquets after the first and second\ninterviews (to assess \"dose\" effects of flowers). (4) In the no-stimulus condition, the\nno-flowers group, participants received bouquets only after the experiment was over\n(to determine baseline measures of normal mood changes without flowers). A florist\ndelivered the bouquets.\nMeasures\nFocus Groups. We pre-tested the measures on older participants since most\nof them were designed originally for use with college students. Eight women over age\n60 who had participated in Study 1 collaborated with us. None of them would be\nincluded in Study 3. We went over the goals and methods of Study 3 with them and\nasked them to do two things. First, we asked them to pair up so that one person\nwould act as the interviewer and the other as the interviewee. They then performed\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nthe whole interview making note of any problems, including length, and then\nsuggested ways to correct them. Any interview questions that were difficult to\nunderstand or objectionable were reworded or eliminated. Second, we asked them for\na general critique of the research and for advice on recruitment. From this, we\ndeveloped the social logs and the episodic memory tasks.\nMood Measures. Both the DES and the LSS administered in Study 1 were\nagain administered in Study 3 (see Study 1 for descriptions).\nSocial Contact Logs. We prepared booklets to help participants keep records\nof daily social encounters. The information in the booklets also would comprise test\nitems to be recalled for the episodic memory tasks (see below). Participants noted\neach social contact, making separate entries for 8 categories: family, friends, medical\npersonnel, household services, neighbors, shopkeepers, religious contacts, delivery\npeople, and other. The booklets were entitled \"Social Contact Log\" with a yellow\ncover page that included clearly written directions. The contents included 4 pages\nwith 3 or 4 rows of boxes along side each category. Instructions were to begin filling\nout the log for Week 1 on the day of the interview and to start the log for Week 2 on\nthe day of the second interview. The pages for Weeks 1 and 2 were distinguished by\ndifferently colored decorative borders. We mailed each participant the booklets and\nrequired a record at least 4 days out of every 7. We included a stamped envelope for\ntheir return and reminded participants during phone contacts to complete the logs and\nreturn them.\nEpisodic memory measure. The memory assessment included three sets of\nmemory questions: (a) memory of the flowers (did not include the group who had not\nreceived flowers, of course); (b) memory of the booklets used for the daily social\ncontact logs; and (c) memory of a social event that had been indicated on the logs.\nThe set of flower questions asked the participant when they had been received and\nthen asked for comments on \"special things\" about the flowers. For those participants\nwho had received flowers, one point was given for recall of types of flowers, one for\ncolors, one for the round glass vase and one for the ribbon on the vase. This score was\nkept separate and used to compare to the other memory score. The set of questions\nabout the booklets included the number of entries per week, the week the booklets\nwere received in the mail, as well \"special things\" about the booklets. Points were\ngiven for naming a category, for describing an icon, for giving the paper color, and\nfor describing the border design. The set of questions about social contacts scored\npoints for describing specific parts of the object or event. Points were given on the\nmemory-for-social contact set of questions if the participant responded with a\nparticular person, time, event and place. One prompt, if necessary, was used to elicit\nmore complete information. The participant received a composite score for the event\nand the booklet recollections.\nProcedure\nThe interviews were double blind. The participant did not know to which\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\ngroup s/he had been assigned (although this became evident over time). Interviewers\nnever knew to which group the participant was assigned. We asked the participants\nnot to tell the interviewer whether or not they had flowers until the memory task,\nwhich included questions about the flowers; this was the last task. The person who\nscheduled flower delivery was separate from the rest of the lab.\nInterviews. The initial contact with the participant simply scheduled\ninterviews and obtained an address so that we could mail the participant a copy of the\ninterview materials, the social contact logs, as well as notify the florist for flower\ndelivery. At the first baseline interview, we obtained baseline data on moods, health,\nsocial support, life satisfaction and some demographic description. The interviewer\nwould also make certain that all the materials had arrived and were understood. The\ninterviewers let the participants set the pace for the interviews. There were two more\ninterviews, about a week apart. The second interview was the same as the baseline\ninterview, excluding demographic information. In the third and final interview, we\nalso included the memory task.\nResults\nMood Interview\nWe predicted that the mood effects seen in Study 1 would be replicated. In the\nfirst study we compared the group receiving flowers with groups receiving other\nstimuli. Here we collapsed the groups who received flowers (early or late or both\nearly and late), comparing them with the group who had not received flowers. As\nexpected, the participants who had received flowers had significantly more positive\nmoods (DES scores for happy and interest questions minus depression -- sad, shame,\nguilt, self-hostility) than participants who had not yet received flowers (t(102) = 2.07,\np<.041). Comparing the groups separately with the no-flowers group reveals trends;\nexamination of means illustrates that these trends are in the expected direction.\nParticipants who had received flowers early reported more interest and happiness (M\nthe second week all participants who had received flowers again report more interest\nThere is some evidence that increasing the number of bouquets is additive.\nOn the DES depression score (sad, shame, guilt, and self-hostility) score, 81% of\nparticipants who received both bouquets, as well as 64% of participants who received\none bouquet, had lower depression scores than they did at the pretest. Only 57% of\nparticipants who had not received flowers (i.e., about half the \"no flowers group\"\nincreased and half decreased their scores, as expected by chance). These slight\ndifferences in the direction of shift between the groups are significant (2(2, N = 104)\n= 6.14, p = 0.05). There are no other significant effects on mood or life satisfaction.\nThe other negative affect factors of the DES are not significantly different; the Life\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nSatisfaction Scale showed no differences.\nSocial Contact\nThere were no significant differences by group on the number of social\ncontacts. We hypothesized that the potential for change in social contacts might be\nvery limited for most of the Participants who resided in retirement homes.\nEpisodic memory--secondary mood effects\nSince the mood shifts were found to be most significant between participants\nwho received flowers at all and those who had not, the sample was collapsed into 2\ngroups, those who had received flowers by the last interview and those who had not.\nThe difference in memory score between these two groups is highly significant. (t(3)\nflower condition). The secondary effect is as strong or stronger than the reported\nmood shift.\nDiscussion\nThe third study replicates Study 1 in that people receiving flower bouquets are\nhappier and perhaps less depressed than people who do not receive bouquets. People\nwho received two may be happier than people who received one. This suggests that\nthe effects found in Studies 1 and 2 are not due simply to surprise, nor do effects\ndissipate rapidly when more flowers are provided.\nStudy 3 provides additional evidence that the increase in positive emotion\nrelated to the flowers will have secondary benefits. Participants who received the\nflowers had higher scores on the episodic memory task than those who had not yet\nreceived any bouquets.\nEven though we collected daily diaries to report on social interaction and even\nthough an examination of the diaries suggested that a subgroup of socially active\nsenior residents increased their social contacts, there was no effect overall. The social\ninteractions of the people in the retirement community are very regular due to\nscheduled visits and planned activities. It is possible that the effect would be seen in\nother contexts with less regimented social interaction. This remains a question for\nfurther research.\nGeneral discussion\nThere is very little extant theory that lends itself to an easy explanation for the\neffects of flowers on positive socio-emotional change as found in our three studies.\nAny explanation of our findings must consider the puzzling strength of the effect of\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nreceiving flowers. In the double-blind design of Study 1, female participants received\none of three possible stimuli. Every participant who received flowers responded with\nthe Duchenne smile in the first 5 sec after the visual presentation. Although it is true\nthat the Duchenne smile is the most common response in all stimulus conditions, it\noccurs significantly more often for the flower presentation, having occurred in every\ninstance. This response was replicated in Study 2 when male and female participants\nreceived a single flower. Again the Duchenne smile occurred significantly more\noften, although it did not reach the 100% response rate found in Study 1. These\nfindings are particularly intriguing because the Duchenne smile is referred to as the\n\"true\" smile and is related to changes in brain chemistry and various\npsychophysiological indices (Dimberg, Thunberg, and Elmehed, 2000). Our results\nindicate that the simple presentation of flowers, even a single flower, will release a\nstrong and immediate behavior reflecting positive affect. Given the presence of the\nDuchenne smile, it is possible that the flowers--either through their visual or odorous\nqualities--have effects on brain chemistry.\nAs mentioned, Study 2 extends the results of Study 1, showing that even a\nsingle flower presented to men or women will elicit a Duchenne smile significantly\nmore often than other stimuli (a pen or nothing). This second study, a naturalistic\nobservation conducted in a public elevator, also investigated other social behaviors.\nThese included the distance participants stood from the experimenter, their initiation\nof conversation, and their looking towards the experimenter. All these social\nbehaviors increased when a flower was presented. Again, this is intriguing,\nparticularly the findings regarding social distance, since the norms for social distance\nThe most typical behavior for elevators that are sparsely occupied is for strangers to\nretreat to opposite corners. That flowers in particular closed the distance between\nstrangers is remarkable. That this did not occur when pens were presented indicates\nthat the receipt of a stimulus in itself did not change the relationship between\nstrangers. It was something about the flowers.\nStudy 3 provided additional evidence that the increase in positive emotion\nwhen flowers are presented is substantial. In the third study, most participants were\nresidents in retirement and assisted living settings, though a few still resided in the\ncommunity while attending senior programs. Demographically, many people in this\nage group are somewhat depressed and may have decrements in their cognitive skills\n(e.g., Backman et al., 2000). Nevertheless, presenting flowers continued to have a\npositive impact on mood. This was sustained or perhaps improved when a second\npresentation was made. Those participants who received flowers had higher scores\non episodic memory tasks.\nAnecdotally, the responses are even more fervent than the behavioral\nobservations have indicated. Some participants responded with such unusual (for\nexperimental studies) emotional displays that we were unprepared to measure them\nand have only field notes to indicate their presence. The delivery experimenters\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nreported that they received hugs and kisses for the flowers. Florists also tell us that\nthis is common. We were invited to return to the participants' homes when they were\n\"off duty\" for refreshments. We received attractive \"Thank you\" cards and letters\nfrom several participants who received flowers for allowing them to be in the study,\nsome with photographs of the flowers, one with multiple photographs to show the\ncontinuing beauty of the bouquet. In many years of studying emotions, we have\nnever received hugs and kisses, thank you notes or photographs, not even for candy,\ndoughnuts, decorated shirts or hats, gift certificates, or direct monetary payment; the\nflowers are different.\nTheoretical Explanations\nGiven that there is little theory to guide us, what explanations might we\npresent for these findings? We suggest that the explanations fall into three categories:\n(1) simple learned associations of flowers with positive social events, (2) associations\nof flowers with food that could be part of an evolutionary response promoting food\nsearch, and (3) flowers as specially evolved human sensory mood enhancers. We will\nreview the evidence and rationale for each possibility.\nLearned Associations. We cannot eliminate the strong possibility that the\nglobal symbolic meaning of the flowers leads to a positive learned response. Our\nattempt to use men as a test of differential learning of positive responses to flowers\nmay not be sufficient. It may be necessary to find a society or group of people who\ndo not use flowers in any symbolic way, if possible. Since the mere presence of\nflowers in study two did not elicit positive social behavior, it remains possible that the\nlearned association between flowers and giving is accounting for much of the effect.\nThe design of study two apparently created an expectation in participants that they\nwould receive a flower. When they did not, the disappointment was palpable. A\nresearch design that looks at the effect of flowers in pubic spaces, or perhaps along\nroadsides, where there is no expectation that they will be given to individuals might\nanswer this question. But even if it is the case that the effect is purely an associative\none, it is still somewhat surprising that there are such strong positive mood effects\nand secondary benefits simply following the receipt of flowers. This associative\nexplanation evades the question about how flowers in comparison to other positive\nobjects, such as food or other highly desirable gifts, have come to have stronger\npositive emotional associations across cultures and history.\nEvolutionary food association. Rather than hypothesize a simple learned\nassociation of flowers and positive social habits, one might hypothesize that there has\nbeen some evolutionary advantage to the attraction of flowers in their relation to\nfruits and other food products. For example, Orians and Heerwagen (1992) suggest\nthat aesthetic preferences for landscapes and potentially other growing things are\nrelated to early hominid survival when these environmental cues would be related to\nforaging success. Thus, flowers would be preferred because humans became hard-\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nwired to \"emotionally\" appreciate \"beauty\" associated with food gathering.\nOrians and Heerwagen (1992) postulate that flowers would evoke a positive\nresponse (joy), that predicted future food supplies and possibly a better place for\nrearing progeny.\nPinker (1997) makes a similar suggestion that the attraction to flowers is\nhardwired into our brain because flowers directly signal the future availability of\nfruit, nuts, or tubers. Humans remember where and when flowers were observed to\nobtain food in the future. The strength of this argument is mitigated by the fact that\nmammals find food with all their senses, most of which are of more immediate use\nthan long term memory for key environmental features (Stiles, 2000). More to the\npoint, the showy flowers that humans seem to find especially attractive generally do\nnot produce edible fruit.\nInstead of the association being either learned or innate, we could take a\nmiddle position that humans are biologically primed to associate flowers with\nhappiness. Under this condition, recognition of flowers would not be hard-wired, per\nse, but aspects of flowers would easily become associated with happiness and it\nwould be very difficult to associate flowers with negative emotions (Cook and\nMood Enhancers. Our last explanation takes a different approach but is in\nsome ways an extension of the middle position. The third hypothesis is that various\nsensory elements of flowers combine, even serendipitously, to directly affect mood.\nThe effect would occur even if a flower were a de novo event in a human experience.\nUsing this explanation, flowers prime positive psychological responses because they\nare \"super stimuli,\" directly affecting moods through multi-channel sensory\ninteractions (or one of the channels alone might be able to carry the effect). It would\nbe easy to learn positive associations, but the general mood effect would be predicted\nto occur without learning.\nMost of the sensory attractors lead partially or entirely to changes in mood.\nThis process places moods or emotions in a central position for the evolution or even\nco-evolution of plants and people \u00ad a process that is useful for the results of our\nstudies. This theory is congruent with Panksepp's (2000a) concept of an affective\nconsciousness. According to Panksepp, there are primal neural networks in the\nposterior thalamic, tectal and periaqueductal regions of the mesencephalon that\nconstantly process emotional information. Organisms seek this information. Sensory\nstimuli such as visual symmetry, color, odor, and pheromones provide the\ninformation sought and affect moods. We will briefly examine some examples of\nthese sensory stimuli as they are not often used to explain socio-emotional results.\nWith respect to symmetry, Enquist and Arak (1994) argue that we have an\nevolved preference for patterned symmetries because these can be detected easily as a\nrecognizable signal within in a wide variety of visual arrays. In other words we are\nattracted to symmetry. The ease of recognition and the familiarity engendered should\nbe associated with improved mood, as well as easy identification (see Zajonc, 1980;\nfor the rationale for an association of familiarity and emotion). There does not need to\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nbe an established memory or association to the flower in order for there to be a\npositive effect. It is the symmetrical pattern alone that is important. One might look\nat it from the point of view of the flowering plant and describe the effect as one in\nwhich the plant uses symmetry to attract a human for seed or tuber dispersal or to\nprotect the plant from predators or dangerous environments. Ultimately, then the\nplant that only has a preferred symmetry, even if it has no other product, potentially\ncan be protected and dispersed by humans. The result for humans is improved mood.\nSimilarly, we may have preferences for certain colors based on the primate\ntrichromatic color visual system. Such a preference might have evolved because the\nvarious color channels are important in finding ripe fruit against a green background\ndistinguishing high protein leaves (Dominy and Lucas, 2001). Again, the preferences\nfor particular colors may be separated from their use in spotting food and become\nrewarding more generally. Plants with preferred colors that have no other products\nwould be protected and dispersed. Plants with preferred colors and symmetry may\nbecome \"superstimuli\" with the combination.\nWe might also have a preference for specific floral odors. To our knowledge\nthis has not been extensively studied within the psychological literature for perception\nand sensing although perfumers have shown that differences in preferences exist (see\nJellinick, 1997). Obviously, humans use olfactory information and relate this to other\nsensory information. The coordination of olfactory and visual cues is known to\ninfluence neurological responding. For example, Sarfarazi et al (1999) showed that\nthe amplitude of the P400 visual event related potential was decreased if the odor cue\ndid not match the visual cue. Considered alone, specific odors seem to modulate\nmoods (see Baron, 1997, Schiffman et al., 1995; Shiffman, Suggs and Sattley-Miller,\n1995; Freyberg, Wilson, and Haviland-Jones, under review). Schiffman and her\ncolleagues have shown that popular colognes that often have a floral topnote will\nreduce depression, and Freyberg, Wilson, and Haviland-Jones have shown that\ncertain putative pheromones or fragrances can reduce negative moods, for example.\nThere is also the possibility that humans might be sensitive to the effects of\nfloral social chemicals. We have long known that a variety of species are responsive\nto pheromones produced by plants to mimic sex pheromones. The perfume\nmanufacturers have believed for centuries that humans are sensitive to such\npheromones and use pheromonal animal products as the base for fine perfumes (e.g.,\ncivit, musk). Several researchers have demonstrated mood effects of androstodienone\non women (Jacob and McClintock, 2000; Wilson et al., under review; Freyburg,\nWilson, and Haviland-Jones, under review). Such social chemicals might function in\ncourtship and increase social behaviors, as well as affecting moods.\nPlants are sometimes considered to be biological chemists. Their chemical\nmake-up is rapidly responsive to other species, time of day, and other variables. They\ncould certainly use chemical or visual cues to attract humans. Following the\nargument that plants have significant, largely unexplored chemical potential, Wilson\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\nThe natural products of plants and animals are a select group in a\nliteral sense. They represent the defense mechanisms and growth\nregulators produced by evolution during uncounted generations, in\nwhich only organisms with the most potent chemicals survived to the\npresent time . .. .Very few pharmaceuticals have been invented from a\nknowledge of the first principles of chemistry and medicine. Most\nhave their origin in the study of wild species. . .( p. 134).\nIs it reasonable to propose that plant-human co-evolution or even domestication is\nbased on socio-emotional rewards? There are many instances of such plant and\nanimal relationships, though they are not usually thought of in this way. Plants may\nreward animals for defending them. For example, the \"swollen thorn\" acacia trees of\nCentral America have large thorns which can be used for ant nests. Their leaves have\nnectaries, which produce nectar consumed by the ants. In return the ants attack any\nherbivores and even remove vegetation around the trees. If the ants are removed, the\nplants are soon killed by predators (Janzen, 1966).\nPlants attract animals for a variety of reasons and by a variety of methods.\nPlants utilize animals for pollination, seed dispersal and protection. While the vast\nliterature on the attractiveness of flowers has been focused almost entirely on insect\npollinators, some flowers attract vertebrate pollinators. For example, a number of\nbat-pollinated flowers emit a sulfur-like odor that mimics odors used in bat mating\nand social recognition (von Helversen, Winkler, and Bestmann, 2000). At least one\nflower, Mucana holtonii, reflects and focuses bat sonar signals to attract pollinators\n(von Helversen and von Helversen, 1999). Other flowers attract hummingbirds with\ncolor; such flowers tend to be red, have symmetrical tubular flowers, and provide a\nheavy nectar flow.\nA wide variety of plants utilize vertebrates as seed dispersing agents (Stiles ,\n2000). Plants have a variety of powerful mechanisms that could affect mood\npositively and attract animals for seed dispersal -- including color, odor or even\nsound. For many plants, including flowering plants, humans are the primary seed-\ndispersing organism. To our knowledge, humans are the only organism that routinely\ndigs up, divides and replants tubers, bulbs and corms of flowers. Some domesticated\nflowers may have become dependent upon humans for propagation (Comba et al.,\n1999). For example, cultivated orchids are a highly selected and preferred flower that\nis hand pollinated by humans. Orchids have a sensory attractiveness but little or no\nfood or medicinal usefulness for people. These scattered features continue to suggest\nthat plants can attract people even if there is no reward in terms of food, medicine,\nshelter and so forth. Plants may only enhance or prime positive moods.\nThe idea that flowering plants with no known food or other survival value\nhave coevolved with humans by using an emotional niche spawns a couple of\nAn Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers\npredictions that can be addressed in future research. First, domesticated flowers\nshould, in general, be better at inducing positive emotions than their progenitors.\nSecond, different flowers will induce their effects through different combinations of\nmodalities. Some might be primarily visual. Others might be visual and olfactory.\nSome may even mimic human pheromones. Given the wide HLA variation among\nhumans in responses to odor (Jacob, et al., 2002), it is also likely that humans vary in\ntheir responses to particular flowers. There may be gender and ethnic effects as well.\nAn extensive literature search for research on why certain flowering plants are\nselected for domestication or propagation yields almost nothing. Many books and\narticles discuss the domestication of plants useful for humans in food, medicine,\nshelter and so forth; the notable exception is the domestication of flowers. We\nsuspect this is part of the general neglect of emotional processes as major contributors\nto biological evolution. Flowers cultivated by humans occur in the wild in disturbed\nground. Usually they are weeds taking cultivated land away from\nedible/burnable/constructive produce. If the flowers induced positive emotions they\nmight have been allowed to remain in or near the cultivated fields. The loss in food\nproduction due to weeds would have been offset by an increase in positive emotion.\nThe selected offspring of these pleasing plants might have become even more\npleasing. We hypothesize that as flowers moved into the new niche created by\nagriculture there was an increase in variation and the more pleasing and attracting\nflowers were allowed to remain. At some point humans might have moved from\nmerely tolerating these weedy species to actively saving and sowing the seeds. It has\nnot escaped our attention that the scenario we present for the evolution of flowers is\nvery much like the scenario that Budiansky (1994) presents for the evolution of dogs.\nFlowers may be the plant equivalent of companion animals.\nOur hypothesis is that cultivated flowers fit into an emotional niche - their\nsensory properties elicit human positive emotions. The flowering plants are thereby\nrewarding to humans and in return, the cultivated flowers receive propagation that\nonly humans can provide. Demonstration of such a phenomenon fills several gaps in\nthe literature. It supports the basic significance of emotion for survival. As a corollary\nit supports the adaptive function of positive as well as negative emotion. Finally it\nopens an area of investigation into the psychological relationships between humans\nand other species through their sensory properties that have been relatively neglected.\n"
