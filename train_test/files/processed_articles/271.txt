This refers to\nreports about a deceased individual's symptoms prior to\ndeath collected by lay personnel from that individual's\nclose relatives or friends after death. These can then be\nused to ascertain the likely cause of death.\nPrior studies have shown that, notwithstanding con-\ncerns about the impact of differential field and analytic\nprocedures, and of limitations in informants' know-\nledge or memory of the circumstances and symptoms\nsurrounding death, VA tends to provide reliable data\non the distribution of deaths by broad category [8]. In\nparticular, several studies have compared VA of adult\nmortality with clinical reports or physician's assessments\nin sub-Saharan Africa settings and have either found\nthat VA data in general tend to have very high levels of\nspecificity, with slightly lower scores on sensitivity\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

V. Doctor, Population Studies Center, University of Pennsylvania, 3718 Locust Walk,\nThese findings are consistent with the fact that sensitiv-\nity and specificity vary across categories of disease (e.g.,\ninfectious, parasitic, non-communicable), by specific\ndisease, and across other causes of death (e.g., accident\nand violence). The typical conclusion of such studies is\ntwofold. First, because VA leads to minimal misclassifi-\ncation of cause of death, such data can be used to\nidentify the most important health problems in a\ndeveloping country setting. Second, VA may even\nprovide more dependable data on the overall distribu-\ntion of cause of death than hospital data, since the latter\nare unlikely to represent all deaths in the community.\nIt is worth noting that this overall reliability of VA data\nin relation to adult mortality is not fully replicated in\nVA data on child mortality. For example, several\nstudies have highlighted problems in distinguishing\ndeaths caused by acute lower respiratory infections\nStudies conducted in settings with moderate to high\nlevels of HIV prevalence suggest that the accuracy of\nVA data extends to the diagnosis of AIDS-related\nmortality in settings with high levels of AIDS. Indeed,\none South African study finds 100% sensitivity with\nrespect to AIDS [16]. This is in spite of concerns that\nthe secondary infections that are the proximate cause of\nAIDS deaths may lead to a confusing array of verbal\nreports about individuals' symptoms, or that the stigma\nassociated with AIDS or local informants' fear of it,\nincluding local constructions in which its symptoms are\ntreated as the outcome of witchcraft, may have caused\nthem to understate what they think are AIDS-related\nsymptoms.\nGeneralizing from these studies remains problematic for\ntwo reasons, however. First, there are issues of sample\nselectivity. The study conducted in a setting with high\nlevels of AIDS, for example, used South African data\n[10,16]; yet the South African population, even in its\npoorest rural sector, is wealthier, healthier, and more\neducated than equivalents elsewhere in sub-Saharan\nAfrica [17]. Similarly, a Zambian study used only urban\ndata [18], and a Tanzanian study had relatively low\nHIV prevalence [19].\nThe second problem is related to temporal changes.\nMost of these studies use data from the early 1990s (the\nmost recent is that of Boerma et al. [19], who used data\nup to 1996). There is at least one reason that their\nclaims about the continued accuracy of VA reporting\nin high-AIDS settings may no longer hold. Specifically,\nincreases in AIDS-related mortality, AIDS-related\npublic health discourses (by government and non-\ngovernmental organization officials, in clinics, schools,\nnewspapers, churches, etc.), and AIDS-related conver-\nsations between individuals (as indicated in studies of\nconversational networks) have been ongoing in most\nareas of east and southern Africa since the mid-1990s.\nThe present study uses data from one such study and\nthe wider data collected in the study have indicated the\nhigh frequency of such conversations. A reasonable\ncultural response to these increases would be for locals\nto begin to appraise all mortality through a type of\nAIDS prism. This would directly affect the accuracy of\nVA reports since it suggests that, even if AIDS is not\nmentioned as a cause of death, memories of a deceased\nindividual's symptoms would increasingly filter out\nsymptoms seen to be inconsistent with AIDS, leading\nultimately to an overestimate of AIDS in the VA data.\nIn short, there could be a danger that the depiction of\nsymptoms in VA reports will become less accurate as\nAIDS increases to affect informants' appraisals of\nmortality. This study examines whether this appears to\nhave occurred in a rural Malawian setting using data\nMethods\nResearch setting and data\nMalawi is a relatively small sub-Saharan Africa country\nin the east and southern African `AIDS-belt' with a\npopulation of almost 11 million, 86% of whom reside\nin rural areas [17]. It is a poor country, even by African\nstandards: its income per capita is US$190, in compari-\nHIV/AIDS prevalence among adults is on the order of\n16% but rising steadily [20]. As elsewhere in the region,\nthe government of Malawi and foreign donors consider\nAIDS to present a crisis for Malawi [18]. AIDS in\nMalawi is also an increasingly frequent focus of social\nresearch, much of it directed at understanding the\nmicro-level effects on local cultural (i.e., interpretive)\nand institutional arrangements in rural settings [21\u00ad26].\nThe mortality data used in this paper were collected as\npart of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change\nProject (MDIC), an ongoing longitudinal project in-\nvolving a sample of almost 1700 ever-married women\nin three areas of Malawi. The overall aim of the MDIC\nis to examine the role of social networks in changing\nattitudes and behavior regarding family planning and\nHIV/AIDS in rural Malawi. The project is based at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania's Population Studies Center.\n(Further details are available at http://www.ssc.upenn.\nedu/Social_Networks/)\nThe questionnaire itself asked about symptoms asso-\nciated with the terminal illness, the relative timing and\nduration of those symptoms, and the types of medical\ntreatment sought and received. Local interviewers were\nemployed, in accordance with standard methodological\nrecommendations [27,28]. The questionnaire used ap-\npropriate local terminology (developed by HVD in\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\npre-fieldwork collaboration with the interviewers) and\ndata collection was supervised by HVD. It is assumed\nthat these methods facilitated the accurate communica-\ntion and recording of symptoms. The possibility that an\ninterviewer effect could impact on these data, specifi-\ncally that interviewers may have wittingly or un-\nwittingly directed respondents or miscoded their\nresponses, thereby generating some false positives; this\nwas minimized by instituting thorough training. Its\neffect was evaluated by estimating intracorrelation coef-\nficients (rho) for the 22 relevant VA variables. In seven\nvariables, rho was , 0.02, the standard threshold for a\nsignificant interviewer effect [29]. In an additional\nand in the remainder of the variables it was > 0.07. All\nseven AIDS-related variables (identified below) were in\nthe first two groups, suggesting that there was minimal\ndifference between interviewers in their measurement\nof informants' responses insofar as these relate to AIDS\n(a summary table is available from the authors).\nDefinition of a death from AIDS\nValidation of VA data requires comparison of diagnoses\nderived from the VA reports with some external\nstandard, usually medical doctors' assessments or clinical\ndiagnoses [30]. As such information was not available,\nthe external standard for the validation of apparent\nAIDS cases was an aggregate one: the observed number\nof deaths identified as `AIDS deaths' in the study was\ncompared with the expected number of such cases.\nAn `AIDS death' was defined as one where the\ninformants reported either that a death was caused\ndirectly by AIDS or the existence of at least two\n`major' signs and at least one `minor' sign of AIDS.\nSuch an identification of `AIDS deaths' lacks sensitivity\nto the extent that certain illnesses will be missed. It also\nlacks specificity to the extent that any non-HIV\ntuberculosis or cancer will also fit the criteria. It was\nassumed that these likely compensate for each other.\nIn past studies, few deaths have been identified in the\nfirst way (e.g., 7% in one of the Tanzanian studies [31],\nand only 3% in the Lusaka study [18]). The bulk of\nAIDS diagnoses are, therefore, based on the more\ninferential second method.\nThe specification of `major' and `minor' signs of AIDS\nis based on the World Health Organization (WHO)\nclassification of AIDS-related symptoms [32]. It draws\non WHO guidelines for the provisional clinical case\ndefinition for AIDS where diagnostic resources are\nlimited [33] and is used by the Malawi National AIDS\nControl Program [34].\nAlthough the lack of specific medical information\nmeans that there are a number of conditions associated\nwith AIDS for which data are not available, including\nthose that are sufficient in themselves to diagnose AIDS\n(generalized Kaposi's sarcoma or cryptococcal menin-\ngitis) and minor signs such as recurrent herpes zoster,\noropharyngeal candidiasis, chronic herpes simples infec-\ntion, and generalized lympadenopathy, the definition\nused is consistent with ones used in previous studies\n[31,33]. The major signs for which data was collected\nare chronic diarrhea for more than 1 month, prolonged\nfever (intermittent or constant) for more than 1 month,\nand weight loss of more than 10% of body weight.\nSince few of these rural informants (nor the deceased\nthemselves) would be likely to know about actual\nchanges in weight, the questionnaire asked about the\nduration of weight loss rather than its extent, assuming\nthat weight loss for more than 1 month is associated\nwith at least 10% of body weight [32]. The minor signs\nwere prolonged cough, prolonged difficulty breathing,\nprolonged pneumonia, and `rash' (considered to be an\nindicator of generalized pruritic dermatitis if it occurred\nin combination with two major signs).\nThe expected number of AIDS cases was calculated as\nthe `excess mortality factor' derived from a comparison\nof adult mortality in this sample with the pre-AIDS\nmortality levels, as measured in the 1987 Malawi census\ndata [35]. Mortality in this adult sample was greater\nthan mortality calculated from 1987 Malawian census\ndata for the same age groups by a factor of 3.0 (95%\nconsistent, it should be noted, with those reported in\nneighboring Zimbabwe over the same period [36].\npredate the effects of AIDS-related mortality, and there\nhave been no reports of systematic increases in other\nnon-AIDS-related causes of mortality for adults over\nthe same period (i.e., not including secondary infec-\ntions facilitated by AIDS), it can be reasonably assumed\nthat this increased mortality reflects the impact of\nAIDS. Translating the 95% confidence interval into an\nexpected distribution of AIDS and non-AIDS mortality\nassociated with AIDS (mean, 74.9%).\nResults\nValidity of data collection\nOf the base sample of almost 1700 ever-married\nwomen of reproductive age (15\u00ad49) and their husbands\n1126 men were interviewed in a first round of data\nwere reported to have died by the second round in\n2001. A good indicator that these reports were accurate\nis the fact that a related research project drawing on\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

In 71 of these (77%), the\ninformant was a close relative such as a spouse or\nsibling; in the remaining 21, the informant was a\nneighbor. There is no statistical difference in any aspect\nof the VA report between these two sources. Nor is\nthere any statistically significant difference in socio-\ndemographic characteristics (as measured in 1998) be-\ntween the 92 individuals with VA data and the 12\nwithout.\nAIDS-related deaths\nReported VA symptoms are shown in Table 1 (some\nof the non-AIDS-related symptoms are grouped to-\ngether). Consistent with studies mentioned above, a\nfew cases (10%) were directly reported as being caused\nby AIDS. Larger percentages of the deceased were said\nto have had at least one major or minor sign of AIDS.\nFor example, 54% had prolonged weight loss, 43% a\nprolonged cough, and more than a quarter prolonged\nfever or malaria, chronic diarrhea, or prolonged pneu-\nmonia. A further 23% had prolonged difficult/rapid\nbreathing and 10% a long-term rash.\nUsing the WHO algorithm, 75.5% of these cases\nappear to be AIDS related. This value is almost exactly\nin the middle of the confidence interval specified by\nthe comparison between observed and expected mor-\ntality. There were no significant gender differences in\nspecific symptoms reported and this is reflected in the\nlack of differences in the overall AIDS-related deaths\ncalculated for men and women: 75.1% of females and\n76.3% of males are reported to have died of AIDS.\nThis is equivalent to a death rate of 0.042 for females\nConclusion\nIn this study, AIDS adult mortality was estimated based\non VA. The study wished to assess whether the\nincreasing scale of the AIDS epidemic in rural areas of\nsub-Saharan Africa, and its preeminence in local public\nhealth discourses and in informal conversations about\nhealth, might affect informants' appraisals of the causes\nof adult mortality, thereby affecting the reliability of\nVA as an assessment of AIDS-related mortality. The\nfore, compared with a mortality factor calculated\nindependently to describe the increase in adult mortal-\nity in Malawi since the onset of AIDS. The comparison\nshows that there is no apparent effect of high AIDS-\nrelated mortality on the accuracy of the VA in the\naggregate. The mortality factor predicted that 75% of\nthe deaths would be AIDS related; 76% of the VA\ndeaths showed consistent signs of AIDS as identified by\nthe WHO criteria, despite the partial lack of sensitivity\nand specificity in the definition of AIDS-related deaths.\nThis study, therefore, confirms studies conducted in\nother areas of Africa, albeit in more educated popula-\ntions and/or at earlier stages of the epidemic, in\nasserting that VA remain a reliable data collection tool\nfor differentiating, at the aggregate level, between\nAIDS and non-AIDS deaths.\nReferences\n1.
