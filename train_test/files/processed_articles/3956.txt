Therefore, angiotensin converting\nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor\nblockers (ARBs) may be more useful for preventing vas-\ncular dysfunction than other hypotensive drugs. However,\na more important effect for patients with hypertension has\nbeen shown to be the production of a lower blood pressure\nthat is stable for 24 h after administration of medication in\nIn general, drug efficacy is thought to be related to plasma\ndrug concentration. However, the hypotensive effect ofACE\ninhibitors may be dependent on the vascular ACE inhibitory\neffect rather than on the plasma effect.3,4 A significant\ncorrelation between vascularACE activity and systolic blood\npressure (SBP) was observed after administration of ACE\ninhibitors in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), but no cor-\nrelation was seen between plasma ACE activity and SBP.4\nHowever, the importance of vascular ARB concentration on\nComparison of the relative importance\nof vascular and plasma drug\nconcentrations to the hypotensive\neffect of telmisartan in rats\nShinji Takai1, Hiroshi Sakonjo2 and Denan Jin3\n Keywords\nAngiotensin II receptor blocker, plasma, vascular tissues, drug concentration, lipophilicity\nDepartment of Innovative Medicine, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki,\nJapan\n2Shiga Research Center, Nissei BILIS, Koka, Japan\n3Department of Pharmacology, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nShinji Takai, Department of Innovative Medicine, Graduate School of\nMedicine, Osaka Medical College, 2-7 Daigaku-machi, Takatsuki 569-\nEmail: pha010@art.osaka-med.ac.jp\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nthe hypotensive effect has been unclear, because measure-\nment of drug concentrations in vascular tissues has been dif-\nficult.Recently,wesucceededinmeasuringtheconcentration\nofARB in plasma and vascular tissues using a novel method,\nmatrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight\nmass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and imaging mass\nspectrometry (IMS) in the selected reaction monitoring\n(SRM) mode.5 In the present study, to clarify the importance\nof the vascular concentration of an ARB on the hypotensive\neffect, the hypotensive effect, angiotensin II-induced vascu-\nlar contraction, and drug concentrations in plasma and vas-\ncular tissue after administration were measured.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nTen-week-oldmalespontaneouslyhypertensive/NDmcr-cp\nrats (SHR/NDmcr-cp) were obtained from Japan SLC Inc.\n(Shizuoka, Japan). All procedures complied with the\nguidelines on animal care of the local Ethics Committee on\nthe Use ofAnimals (protocol number 8815, Shiga Research\nCenter, Nissei BILIS, Koka, Japan).\nEach rat was orally administered 3 mg/kg of telmisar-\ntan. SBP was monitored by tail-cuff plethysmography\nh after oral drug administration, and the rats were then\nanesthetized with isoflurane to obtain blood and vascular\ntissues.\nVascular responses in the isolated artery\nIsolated rat carotid arteries were cut into 10 mm \u00d7 1.0 mm\nhelical strips and placed on a myograph under a resting\nat 37\u00b0C and continuously bubbled with 5% CO2\n. The\nstrips were initially vasoconstricted with 50 mM KCl, and\nthe response of each strip served as the reference for angi-\notensin II (30 \u00b5M)-induced contraction of the correspond-\ning strip.\nTo measure plasma drug concentration, a MALDI matrix\nconsisting of 7 mg/mL of -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic\nacid (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was directly\nmixed with plasma, and the mixture was placed on a\nMALDI plate (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA).5\nTo measure vascular drug concentration, aortic tissue\nwas frozen in TissueTechTM (Sakura Fineteck, Osaka), and\neach block was sectioned at a thickness of 12 \u00b5m.6 The\nsections were mounted on indium-tin-oxide-coated glass\nslides (Bruker Daltonics), and then -CHCA matrix was\ncoated onto the sections.\nThe concentration of telmisartan in plasma and vascular\nslices was quantified using MALDI-TOFMS and -IMS in\nthe SRM mode on an Autoflex Speed TOFMS (Bruker\nDaltonics) equipped with a SmartbeamTM-II solid-state\nlaser (wavelength, 355 nm; focused diameter, 20 m; rep-\netition rate, 500 Hz).5 Telmisartan detected by MALDI-\nTOFMS and -IMS in the SRM mode is all active form, and\nits metabolites did not be detected.\nWith respect to the precision of measuring telmisartan in\nplasma (n = 8), the variability of results was 5.8%, and the\naccuracy values ranged between from -11.0% to -3.7%.\nThe limit of telmisartan measurement in plasma by\nMALDI-TOFMS in the SRM mode was 2.0 nM. The preci-\nsion for the measurement of telmisartan in sliced aorta was\nevaluated using dropped telmisartan on a glass slide (n = 8).\nThe variability of results was 4.6%, and the accuracy val-\nues ranged from -2.3% to 9.2%. The limit of telmisartan\nmeasurement in sliced aorta by MALDI-IMS in the SRM\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean\n(SEM). The significance of differences between mean val-\nues for multiple groups was evaluated using one-way anal-\nysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. Differences\nwere considered significant at a p value < 0.05.\nResults\nSBP and angiotensin II-induced vascular\ncontraction\nSBP was significantly lower at 2 h than at pre-treatment,\nand a significant lowering effect was also observed at 24 h\n(Figure 1(a)). There was no significant difference between\nAngiotensin II-induced vascular contractions were\ntively, when the contraction before administration of tel-\nmisartan was assumed to be 100% (Figure 1(b)). No\nsignificant difference was also observed between 2 h and\nPlasma and vascular concentrations of\ntelmisartan\nrespectively, and the difference was significant (Figure 2(a)).\noral administration, respectively (Figure 2(b)). Although\nthe vascular concentration of telmisartan tended to be lower\nfrom 2 h to 24 h, no significant difference was observed.\nTakai et al. 3\nDiscussion\nIn general, higher lipophilic drugs including ACE inhibi-\ntors may be more likely to remain in tissues for the long-\nterm.3,4 Both vascular ACE inhibition and a hypotensive\neffect were observed until several days after administra-\ntion of a high-lipophilic ACE inhibitor (trandolapril).3\nSignificant vascular ACE inhibition continued until 24 h\nafter administration in SHR treated with the high-lipo-\nphilic ACE inhibitors trandolapril and perindopril, but not\nwith the low-lipophilic ACE inhibitors enalapril and\ntemocapril, although these ACE inhibitors inhibited vascu-\nlar ACE activity equally 3 h after administration.4 Like\nACE inhibitors, ARBs also shows various lipophilicities.\nThe lipophilicity index is defined as the ratio of octanol to\n(an active metabolite of losartan); -0.96 with candesartan;\nwith telmisartan.6 Among ARBs, telmisartan has been well\nknown to show a high-lipophilic character, and telmisartan\nwas used to clarify the importance of the vascular concen-\ntration of ARBs on the hypotensive effect.\nIn the present study, telmisartan showed a significant\nhypotensive effect 2 h after administration, and the hypoten-\nsive effect was observed until 24 h. The significant attenua-\ntion of angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction seen at\n2 h after administration was also observed until 24 h. These\nfindings suggest that blockade of angiotensin II receptors\nwas continued until 24 h after administration, and the con-\ntinuous vascular blockade resulted in lower SBP. In fact,\n90% of the vascular telmisartan concentration detected 2 h\nafter administration was maintained until 24 h. On the other\nhand, plasma telmisartan concentration was decreased by\nSBP and angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction until\n24 h after administration may be dependent on the mainte-\nnance of vascular telmisartan concentration, but not plasma\ntelmisartan concentration.\nAs a limitation, the data shown in Figure 2(b) may\ninclude the non-specific bound drug to tissue; the ratio of\ndrug bound specifically to angiotensin II receptors to that\nbound non-specifically in vascular tissues is not known.\nAlthough different ratios of specific to non-specific bind-\ning are observed among different drugs, the tissue drug\nconcentration is thought to reflect the pharmacological\neffect using the same drug. In the present study, the high\nmaintenance of vascular drug concentration at 24 h com-\npared with that at 2 h may reflect the long-term pharmaco-\nlogical effect.\nIn the clinical setting, it is very difficult to use vascu-\nlar drug concentration as a biomarker for the hypotensive\neffect of ARBs. However, the importance of vascular\ndrug concentration demonstrated in the present study\nmay help us understand the mechanism of the hypoten-\nsive effect of ARBs and to develop long-acting pharma-\ncotherapy. Drugs need to maintain a stable hypotensive\neffect for 24 h after their administration in the clinic, and\nevaluation of vascular drug concentration may be useful\nfor the development of long-acting antihypertensive\ndrugs, including ARBs.\nConclusions\nIn general, plasma drug concentration has been thought to\nbe important for drug efficacy, but vascular drug concentra-\ntion may be more important in reflecting the hypotensive\neffect when using high-lipophilic drugs such as telmisartan.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFigure 1.
