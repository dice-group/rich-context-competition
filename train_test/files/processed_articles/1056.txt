First, it is possible to\ndemonstrate that treatment has some impact. As an example,\nusing longitudinal data from representative samples, Weisner\net al. (2003a, b) have shown that problem drinkers who access\ntreatment are more likely to resolve their concerns than those\nwho do not access treatment. While the impact of treatment is\nmodest, these findings are an important adjunct to clinical trial\nefficacy research (see reviews Miller et al., 1995; Moyer et al.,\n2002) because it demonstrates what happens to the population\nof individuals with alcohol problems as opposed to just those\nfew individuals who enter treatment trials. In contrast to this\nfinding, population research also demonstrates the fact that\nthe majority of people with alcohol problems deal with their\ndrinking concerns without treatment (Dawson, 1996;\nCunningham, 1999). Hence, while treatment effectiveness\nresearch employing representative population samples can\nindicate that attending treatment accrues some advantages as\nfar as increasing the chances of recovery, such research also\ndemonstrates that this pathway is the less chosen one and that\nmost people with alcohol problems deal with their concerns\nwithout ever using treatment.\nWhat else can be learnt about treatment from population\nsamples? Is it possible to find any indication whether some\ntypes of treatment might be more effective than others? There\nare limitations to which population surveys can be used to\naddress this question. Such surveys are often cross-sectional,\nhence any findings are limited by the lack of longitudinal data.\nThe incidence of treatment use in the general population of\nproblem drinkers is also low (e.g. Cunningham and Breslin,\n2004), hence sample sizes are often not large enough to\ncompare different treatment modalities. Finally, population\nsurveys are usually not designed to explore this question, so the\nitems contained in these surveys are often not detailed enough\nto be of any use for this purpose. One possible approach to\ntake, however, is to explore the short-term impact of treatment\nusing population survey data. Population surveys usually have\ntheir focus on drinking and service use in the last year so it\nshould be possible, given a large enough sample, to explore\nwhether different treatment modalities are associated with\nshort-term resolutions from alcohol problems in the last year.\nData from the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health\n(NSDUH; US Department of Health and Human Services,\n2004) were used to explore whether treatment use was\nassociated with short-term recoveries. The 2002 NSDUH\ncomprises a large (n = 54 079) representative sample of the\nUS population. The NSDUH is a yearly survey that employs a\nstratified, multistage area probability sample of the US. The\ntarget population for the survey is civilians, 12 years or older.\nThe interviews for the 2002 survey were conducted face-to-face\nand the overall response rate was 79%.\nThe 2002 NSDUH assessed the past-year alcohol\ndependence or abuse using items from DSM-IV (American\nPsychiatric Association, 1994) and asked about treatment use\nas well. Questions about treatment use were asked after all the\nsections assessed the use of different illicit drugs. Treatment\nwas defined as accessing any treatment services for either\nillicit drug use or alcohol use in the past year, i.e. `These next\nquestions deal with treatment for alcohol and drug problems,\nnot including cigarettes. Please report treatment or counseling\ndesigned to help you reduce or stop your alcohol or drug use.\nPlease include detoxification and any other treatment for\nmedical problems associated with your alcohol or drug use.\nHave you ever received treatment or counseling for your use\nof alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes?' Respondents\nagreeing to this item were then asked, `During the last\n12 months, have you received treatment or counseling for your\nuse of alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes?' Both\nalcohol and drug treatment were included because there is\nsome overlap in treatment modalities for all substance abuse\nproblems (Rotgers et al., 1996). If respondents answered yes\nto these screener questions, they were asked about use of the\nspecific treatment options identified on Table 1. For the\npurposes of this study, short-term recoveries were assessed in\ntwo ways. First, respondents were asked if they had ever\nconsumed 5 drinks on one occasion in the past 30 days.\nSecond, respondents were asked if they had consumed any\nalcohol in the past 30 days. A standard drink was defined for\nthe respondent at the time these questions were asked.\nPrevalence estimates were calculated using weighted data on\nthe online data analysis system of the Substance Abuse and\nMental Health Data Archive. Sample sizes are presented as\nunweighted data.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 displays the treatment use and past-month drinking of\nthe 5730 respondents with alcohol abuse or dependence in the\npast year. Less than 10% of these respondents had accessed any\ntype of treatment for alcohol or drug concerns in the past year.\nOf all 5730 respondents, 10% were abstinent in the past month\nand 22.5% had not consumed 5 drinks on one occasion on any\nday in the past month. Inspection of the proportions of\nrespondents who accessed treatment and displayed reduced\ndrinking in the past month also indicated that: (i) respondents\nwho accessed some type of treatment were more likely to be\nabstinent and to have not binged in the past month compared\nwith respondents who had not accessed treatment [Abstinent\nP < 0.01]; and (ii) there was variation in the proportion of\nrespondents who reported abstinence and binge-free drinking in\nthe past month depending on the type of treatment they had\naccessed (Abstinent: proportions ranged from 18% for treatment\nin prison to 36% for treatment in a hospital; No binge:\nproportions ranged from 23% for treatment in prison to 41% for\ntreatment at a doctor's office).\nDISCUSSION\nIn line with the findings of Weisner et al. (2003a, b), the\npresent study provides evidence that people who access\ntreatment do better on an average compared with those who do\nnot seek help for their alcohol concerns. This finding should\nbe tempered by the facts that <10% of people with alcohol\ndependence or abuse actually sought treatment and that there\nwas also evidence of short-term recoveries among respondents\nwho did not seek treatment (albeit a lower proportion).\nFinally, there was a variation in the proportion of short-term\nrecoveries among the subsets of treated respondents who\naccessed different types of services.\nWhat can be concluded from these findings? First, it is\nprobably true that people with alcohol dependence or abuse\nwill do better if they seek treatment, as the present study\ndemonstrated an 10% increase in the past-month abstinence\nand binge-free rates between respondents who sought\ntreatment compared with those who did not. However, this\nconclusion should be viewed with some caution because\nrespondents were not randomly assigned to treatment, so\ncausal statements cannot be made and it is possible that some\nsystematic difference that covaried with treatment access\ncould be the true explanation as to why these respondents did\nbetter as opposed to this improvement being the result of\ntreatment use. Another alternative explanation is that the\nassociation of no binge or abstinence in the past month with\ntreatment could occur because alcohol abusers who were\nformerly continuous drinkers and are now episodic heavy\ndrinkers may be more likely to seek treatment than those who\nremain as continuous heavy drinkers. This might happen if the\ncontinuous abuser tried to abstain using his or her own\nresources, then finds he or she can only do so for periods\n(becomes `episodic') and then, seeks help.\nCaution should also be used in interpreting the results for\nseveral other reasons. First, the present study only investigated\npast-month drinking and provided no evidence regarding\nsustained recoveries from alcohol abuse or dependence.\nSecond, while it is justified to ask about use of alcohol and\ndrug treatment because there is overlap in the content and\ntarget population of these services, this analytic choice should\nbe taken into consideration when interpreting the findings.\nThird, while the results of this study can probably be used to\nindicate that there is variation in the impact of different\ntreatment modalities, it would be inappropriate to use the\nfindings to state that one treatment modality is superior to the\nother. This type of analysis does not offer any information\nabout the type of person that ends up in different treatment\nservices. How do their characteristics vary and what impact\ndoes this variation have on drinking outcome, irrespective of\nthe treatment used?\nMoreover, these treatment sub-samples were partially\noverlapping because the sum of respondents who used each of\nthe treatment modalities exceeded the total number of\nrespondents who accessed any of the treatments. Despite these\nlimitations, the final conclusion that can be drawn from these\nfindings is that, while the provision of treatment services is a\nlaudable effort that has some impact, it is still the pathway\nchosen by the minority of respondents in their drinking\ncareers (Burton and Williamson, 1995; Cunningham and\nTable 1.
