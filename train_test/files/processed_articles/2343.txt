Introduction\nIn Furman v. Georgia (1972) [1], the United States Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the\ndeath penalty was unconstitutional as currently administered because the arbitrary imposition of death\nviolated the 8th and 14th amendments. 1 For Justices Douglas 2 and Marshall 3 the meaning of\narbitrariness was social--race and class influenced death sentencing. For Justices Stewart, Brennan,\nand White the meaning of arbitrariness was numerical--the proportion of death-eligible defendants\nwho were actually sentenced to death was so negligible that the ultimate state sanction had become\nrandom and capricious. In the famous words of Justice Stewart:\nThese death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel\nand unusual. For of all the people convicted of rapes and murders in 1967 and 1968, many just as\nreprehensible as these, the petitioners are among a capriciously selected random handful upon whom the\nsentence of death has in fact been imposed...the 8th and 14th amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a\nsentence of death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly\nJustice Brennan added:\nWhen the punishment of death is inflicted in a trivial number of the cases in which it is legally available, the\nconclusion is virtually inescapable that it is being inflicted arbitrarily. Indeed, it smacks of little more than a\nJustice White concurred:\nThe conclusion, as I have said, is that the death penalty is exacted with great infrequency even for the most\natrocious crimes and that there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which it is imposed\nfrom the many cases in which it is not ([1], p. 313). 4\n1 Given that Furman was a plurality opinion, arbitrariness can only be interpreted as the holding of the Court under\nMarks v. United States [2].\n2 Justice Douglas: \"A law that stated that anyone making more than $ 50,000 would be exempt from the death penalty\nwould plainly fall, as would a law that in terms said that blacks, those who never went beyond the fifth grade in school,\nthose who made less than $3,000 a year, or those who were unpopular or unstable should be the only people executed.\nA law which in the overall view reaches that result in practice has no more sanctity than a law which in terms provides\nthe same. Thus, these discretionary statutes are unconstitutional in their operation. They are pregnant with\ndiscrimination and discrimination is an ingredient not compatible with the idea of equal protection of the laws that is\nimplicit in the ban on `cruel and unusual' punishments\" ([1], pp. 256\u00ad57).\n3 Justice Marshall: \"Regarding discrimination, it has been said that `it is usually the poor, the illiterate, the\nunderprivileged, the member of the minority group--the man who, because he is without means, and is defended by a\ncourt-appointed attorney--who becomes society's sacrificial lamb.' Indeed, a look at the bare statistics regarding\nexecutions is enough to betray much of the discrimination\" ([1], p. 364).\n4 Beyond noting the inability to meaningfully distinguish between defendants sentenced to life and death, Justice White\nargued that the rare imposition of death undercuts deterrence: \"Most important, a major goal of the criminal law--to\nAlthough Furman invalidated existing state and federal statutes and commuted more than 600 death\nrow inmates to life in prison, it did not mark the end of capital punishment. Indeed, 35 states reinstated\nthe death penalty between 1972 and 1976. Some states attempted to eliminate arbitrariness by making\nthe death penalty mandatory for defendants convicted of particular crimes. Other states adopted\n\"guided discretion\", an approach that: (1) narrowed and specified the range of crimes eligible for death\n(by delineating the statutory aggravators that elevated the seriousness of the offense); (2) bifurcated the\nguilt and punishment phases of a capital trial (so the rules of evidence could be relaxed in the\npunishment phase, allowing the prosecution and defense to present more information to jurors\nregarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances); and (3) guaranteed automatic appellate review of\ndeath sentences. In Woodson v. North Carolina (1976) and the companion case of Roberts v. Louisiana\n(1976), the Supreme Court struck down mandatory death statutes on a 5-4 vote arguing that the\nprotection of human dignity required individual consideration of each case [3,4]. But the Supreme\nCourt upheld guided discretion statutes on a 7-2 vote in Gregg v. Georgia (1976) and the companion\nIn Gregg, the Court assumed that guided discretion would solve the problem of arbitrariness\nidentified in Furman. The Court's logic was straightforward: if state legislatures narrowed the range of\noffenses that were eligible for death through the specification of aggravating circumstances then the\npool of death-eligible defendants would be restricted to \"the worst of the worst\"; if the pool of\ndeath-eligible defendants was restricted to \"the worst of the worst\" then most would be sentenced to\ndeath, thus eliminating social and numerical arbitrariness. Justice White articulated the prediction in Gregg:\nThe Georgia Legislature has plainly made an effort to guide the jury in the exercise of its discretion, while at\nthe same time permitting the jury to dispense mercy on the basis of factors too intangible to write into a\nstatute, and I cannot accept the naked assertion that the effort is bound to fail. As the types of murders for\nwhich the death penalty may be imposed become more narrowly defined and are limited to those which are\nparticularly serious or for which the death penalty is peculiarly appropriate as they are in Georgia by reason\nof the aggravating-circumstance requirement, it becomes reasonable to expect that juries--even given\ndiscretion not to impose the death penalty--will impose the death penalty in a substantial portion of\nthe cases so defined. If they do, it can no longer be said that the penalty is being imposed wantonly and\nfreakishly or so infrequently that it loses its usefulness as a sentencing device. There is, therefore, reason to\nexpect that Georgia's current system would escape the infirmities which invalidated its previous system\nThe opposite occurred: the range of death-eligible offenses has consistently expanded since the time\nof Gregg, but the number of defendants who are actually sentenced to death has plummeted in recent\nresist the political temptation to widen the net--an increasingly broad array of offenses have become\ndeath-eligible as states repeatedly add new statutory aggravators, expand existing statutory\naggravators, or expand the definition of capital murder (see also [12]). Simon and Spaulding quip that\naggravators have been added to statutes \"like Christmas tree ornaments\" ([13], p. 82). Even more\ndeter others by punishing the convicted criminal--would not be substantially served where the penalty is so seldom\ninvoked that it ceases to be the credible threat essential to influence the conduct of others\" ([1], p. 312).\nconsequential than the number of aggravators is the breadth of aggravators. In some states, a defendant\nis eligible for death if he/she commits a murder that fits one or more of the following broad\naggravators: the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel; the murder created a grave risk of death to\nsomeone other than the victim; the defendant committed a prior violent felony; the defendant was\nunder correctional supervision at the time of the murder (including probation or parole); the defendant\ncommitted the murder after \"lying in wait;\" or the murder was premeditated ([10], pp. 400\u00ad30). 5\nDespite the expanding number and scope of statutory aggravators, fewer defendants are being\nsentenced to death. 6 As Figure 1 demonstrates, the annual number of death sentences in the United\nThe Court's erroneous prediction in Gregg raises an important question: do social and numerical\narbitrariness remain? The answer regarding social arbitrariness is clear--a multitude of studies suggest\nthat race and class continue to influence capital punishment [16\u00ad22]. Although numerical arbitrariness\nhas not been studied as extensively, the limited empirical record is troubling. Consider the following.\n5 Breadth is further expanded if an aggravator can be applied to non-killers, a question examined by Kamin and Marceau [14].\n6 It is true that state courts have attempted to narrow the scope of some broad aggravators, but such efforts have not been\ncomprehensive. In addition, such efforts are often futile. Focusing on the heinous/atrocious/cruel aggravator and using\nArizona as an example, Kirchmeier notes that attempts to clarify the aggravator rely on equally vague and\nencompassing language such as \"gratuitous violence\" and the \"senselessness of the murders\" ([10], p. 365).\nKirchmeier ([10], p. 368) quotes the Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court: \"If there is some `real science' to\nseparating `especially' heinous, depraved, or cruel killers from `ordinary' heinous, depraved, or cruel killers, it escapes\nme. It has also escaped the court.\"\nNumber of Death Sentences\nIn Furman, the Supreme Court ruled that a death sentence rate of 15% to 20% was unconstitutional--the\nequivalent of drawing a name out of a hat (the death sentence rate is the percentage of death-eligible\ndefendants who are actually sentenced to death). 7 Steven Shatz [23] explains:\nWhen the Court decided in Furman that the death penalty, as then administered by the states, created too\ngreat a risk of arbitrariness, it was the Justices' understanding that only 15%\u00ad20% of death-eligible\nmurderers were sentenced to death. This was the figure cited by Chief Justice Burger, writing for the four\ndissenters, and he based his estimate on four sources. Justice Stewart, in turn, cited to the Chief Justice's\nstatement as support for his conclusion that the imposition of death was `unusual.' In Gregg v. Georgia, the\nplurality reiterated this understanding: `It has been estimated that before Furman less than [20%] of those\nconvicted of murder were sentenced to death in those States that authorized capital punishment.' It was this\nfact--that fewer than one in five statutorily death-eligible defendants were being sentenced to death in the\nabsolute discretion of the sentencer--that caused the Justices in Furman to find that the death penalty was\n`exacted with great infrequency,' was `so wantonly and so freakishly imposed' as to be like `being struck by\nlightning,' and, consequently, was inescapably arbitrary (pp. 745\u00ad46).\nYet modern research suggests that the death sentence rate is 11% in California ([24], p. 1332), 4% in\nThe research record in Texas is also imbalanced. Despite several studies on social arbitrariness [27\u00ad36],\nwe are not aware of a single study in Texas devoted to numerical arbitrariness. The purpose of the\ncurrent research is to begin filling the gap by estimating the death sentence rate in Texas during the\nperiod from 2006 to 2010. Estimating the death sentence rate is important for each state that retains\ncapital punishment; if the death sentence rate falls below the critical threshold established in Furman\nthen the state's capital punishment system is unconstitutional as administered. After all, the\nconstitutional principle established in Furman has never been repudiated ([24], pp. 1338\u00ad39). Instead,\n7 Justice Burger: \"Although accurate figures are difficult to obtain, it is thought that from 15 to 20% of those convicted of\nmurder are sentenced to death in States where it is authorized\" ([1], footnote 11, p. 387). Justice Powell: \"No fully\nreliable statistics are available on the nationwide ratio of death sentences to cases in which death was a statutorily\npermissible punishment. At oral argument, counsel for petitioner in No. 69-5003 estimated that the ratio is 12 or 13 to\none. Others have found a higher correlation one out of every five or 20% of persons convicted of murder received the\n8 Justice Stevens: \"To avoid this constitutional flaw, an aggravating circumstance must genuinely narrow the class of\npersons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the\ndefendant compared to others found guilty of murder\" ([37], p. 877).\n9 Justice White: \"Thus, the emphasis was on the constitutionally necessary narrowing function of statutory aggravating\n10 Justice Powell: \"In sum, our decisions since Furman have identified a constitutionally permissible range of discretion in\nimposing the death penalty. First, there is a required threshold below which the death penalty cannot be imposed. In this\ncontext, the State must establish rational criteria that narrow the decisionmaker's judgment as to whether the\ncircumstances of a particular defendant's case meet the threshold\" ([39], p. 305).\nFocusing on Texas is also important for two additional reasons. To begin, Texas leads the nation in\nEven more importantly for the research question at hand, Texas offers a conservative test that can\nprovide broad insights. Reproduced in Table 1, the Texas capital murder statute is a partial exception\nto the rule of ever-expanding death eligibility--the statute includes a significant number of\naggravators, but the statute does not include any of the broad aggravators outlined above that\nsubstantially widen the net (technically, Texas defines eligibility through the elements of capital\nmurder rather than aggravators, but elements and aggravators are functionally equivalent--a topic we\nconsider below) [44]. To situate Texas in the landscape of statutes, Table 2 examines the distribution\nof broad aggravators across the 32 current death penalty states: 3 states do not have any broad\nSuch a distribution demonstrates the nature of a conservative test: if the death sentence rate in Texas\nfalls below the critical threshold despite the absence of broad aggravators then the death sentence rate\npresumably falls below the critical threshold in states with broad aggravators (broad aggravators\nenlarge the pool of death-eligible defendants; enlarging the pool depresses the death sentence rate\nunless the number of death sentences keeps pace, an improbable scenario in an era of plummeting\ndeath sentences).\nTable 1.

Georgia,\nwhich has come to stand for the principle that a sentencer's discretion to return a death sentence must be constrained by\nspecific standards, so that the death penalty is not inflicted in a random and capricious fashion\" ([42], p. 657).\n14 Justice Kennedy: \"As we have explained, the aggravating circumstance must meet two requirements. First, the\ncircumstance may not apply to every defendant convicted of a murder; it must apply only to a subclass of defendants\nconvicted of murder. Second, the aggravating circumstance may not be unconstitutionally vague\" ([43], p. 972).\nTable 1.

See [10] note 359;\nTo anticipate, our findings suggest that the death sentence rate in Texas falls between 3% and 6%\ndepending on different assumptions that can be made about the data. Although it is not clear what\ndeath sentence rate would pass constitutional muster, it is clear from the Court's decision in Furman\nthat a death sentence rate of 20% or less would not ([24], p. 1289). Given the enduring relevance of the\nFurman principle, our data suggest that the modern Texas death penalty is unconstitutional--a fatal\nlottery. If death is a bolt of lightning in Texas despite the absence of broad aggravators then death is\npresumably a bolt of lightning across the remaining states that sanction execution.\n2. Narrowing the Pool of Death-Eligible Defendants in Texas\nThe guided discretion statutes that were deemed constitutional in Gregg differed significantly from\none another. The Georgia and Florida statutes followed the Model Penal Code's recommendation:\nnarrow the pool of death-eligible defendants to the \"worst of the worst\" by defining murder broadly\nand then requiring the prosecution to prove the existence of a statutory aggravator--such as killing a\npolice officer--during the penalty phase of the trial [45,46]. But Texas charted a different course to\narrive at the same destination. Specifically, the Texas legislature narrowed the pool of death-eligible\ndefendants to the \"worst of the worst\" through the definition of capital murder. In Texas, capital\nmurder is restricted to murders that are committed intentionally or knowingly and include an additional\nelement, such as killing a police officer [45,46]. The prosecution must prove the statutorily defined\nelement during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial to secure a conviction for capital murder [45].\nHaving convicted the defendant of capital murder, Texas jurors must answer special sentencing issues\nduring the punishment phase of the trial. To begin, jurors must decide \"whether there is a probability\nthat the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\nsociety\" [47]. If so, jurors must decide \"whether, taking into consideration all of the evidence,\nincluding the circumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and background, and the personal\nmoral culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to\nwarrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be imposed\" [47].\nIf the answers are \"yes\" and \"no\" then the judge sentences the defendant to death.\nSo who is eligible for the death penalty in Texas? The answer: A defendant who could be convicted\nof capital murder in the guilt/innocence phase. Dix and Schmolesky [46] explain:\nThe legislatively defined offense was more restrictive and accomplished a narrowing of death eligibility\nbefore the case arrived at the punishment phase. The Supreme Court approved of this guilt/innocence phase\nlegislative narrowing as the equivalent of aggravating factors ([46], p. 1).\nThe special sentencing issues considered in the punishment phase--future dangerousness and\nmitigating circumstances--provide guidance regarding which defendants should be sentenced to death\namong those who are eligible. Dix and Schmolesky [46] continue:\nWhile the Model Penal Code paradigm of aggravating and mitigating factors accomplished both the required\nnarrowing and the jury guidance, Texas accomplished narrowing at the guilt/innocence phase and the special\nissues arguably provided guidance at the punishment phase. If the jury had been given unbridled discretion\nfollowing the eligibility determination of the guilt/innocence stage, the Texas system would have failed to\nwin the approval of the Court because there would be none of the guidance that Gregg required after the\nclass of those determined to be eligible was narrowed ([46], p. 2).\nThus, eligibility is defined by the elements of capital murder and selection is guided by the special\nsentencing issues. 15\nThe differences across statutes are meaningful: Most states narrowed the pool by specifying\naggravators that must be proved during the penalty phase of the trial, but Texas narrowed the pool by\n15 Some have argued that death-eligibility in Texas is defined by the elements of capital murder and a finding of future\ndangerousness [48]. However, this is not the prevailing view [46].\nspecifying elements of capital murder that must be proved during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial [45].\nNonetheless, the Court concluded that the elements of capital murder in Texas are the functional\nequivalent of aggravators in most states [46]. Justice Stevens wrote in Jurek v. Texas (1976):\nWe conclude that Texas' capital sentencing procedures, like those of Georgia and Florida, do not violate the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments. By narrowing its definition of capital murder, Texas has essentially\nsaid that there must be at least one statutory aggravating circumstance in a first-degree murder case before a\ndeath sentence may even be considered ([7], p. 276).\nGiven the functional equivalence of elements and aggravators, we use the more common and simpler\nterm \"aggravator\" throughout the paper to avoid unnecessary confusion.\n3. Estimating the Death Sentence Rate in Texas\npassed Senate Bill 60 giving capital jurors two sentencing options: death or life without parole\n(LWOP). SB 60 represented a significant legal turning point--prior to the passage of the bill capital\njurors in Texas chose between death and life with the possibility of parole after 40 years. Thus, SB 60\nprovides a logical place to begin our investigation of numerical arbitrariness in the modern Texas death\npenalty system. Because the bill became effective in September 2005, we chose 2006 as the starting\npoint for data collection [49]. 16 We chose 2010 as the ending point for data collection under the\nassumption that virtually all the defendants who were going to be sentenced to death for murders\nwe concluded data analysis).\nThe death sentence rate has two components: the numerator is the number of defendants who were\nsentenced to death for capital murders committed in Texas during the time period in question; the\ndenominator is the number of defendants who were eligible to be sentenced to death for capital\nmurders committed in Texas during the time period in question (the proportion is multiplied by 100 to\nproduce a percentage).\nData for the numerator were drawn from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website [50].\nThe website indicates that 38 defendants were sentenced to death for murders committed between\n2006 and 2010. The defendants in question are listed in Table 3 (the table also includes information\nregarding the date of the murder, the date the defendant arrived on death row, the county of conviction,\nthe statutory aggravator, and the race/gender of the defendant and victim).\n16 We are not suggesting that SB 60 is responsible for the low death sentence rate in Texas. Indeed, the death sentence rate\nmight have been lower, higher, or the same in prior historical periods. The death sentence rate is a product of several\nfactors and we do not have the data to comment on changes over time and the potential role of SB 60 in such changes.\nRather than implying a causal relationship, we simply treat SB 60 as a significant legal change and a natural place to\nbegin our investigation of numerical arbitrariness in the modern Texas system.\nName\nDate of\nMurder\nDate\nReceived\nDeath Row\nCounty Aggravator\nRace/Gender\nDefendant\nRace/Gender\nVictim\nWF\nChanthakoummane,\nKosoul\nArmstrong,\nDouglas\nNotes: Codes for aggravators: 1 = robbery, 2 = rape, 3 = police victim, 4 = arson, 5 = multiple victims, 6 =\nchild victim, 7 = obstruction.\nData for the denominator were drawn from Supplemental Homicide Reports (SHR) [51]. 17\nCollected as part of the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report, SHR data provide information on all\nhomicide incidents reported to the police across the United States. We began by narrowing the data to\nincidents to 8,173 \"potential homicide defendants\"--individuals who could have been arrested for\nhomicide (the data must be disaggregated because one incident can include multiple people who are\ndeath-eligible). 18 Throughout the remainder of the paper, we refer to \"potential homicide defendants\"\nas \"defendants\" to avoid such a cumbersome term (even though some of the individuals in question\nwere not arrested).\nOf the 8,173 defendants, how many were eligible for death? The initial criterion is the presence of\nan aggravator. The SHR data indicate whether the murder included any of the following aggravators in\nthe Texas statute: child victim; multiple victims; murder during the commission of a robbery, burglary,\nor sexual assault; and murder by arson. Although the SHR data do not specify whether the victim was\na police officer or corrections officer, we used the \"Officer Down Memorial Page\" website to identify\nsuch cases [53]. Unfortunately, the SHR data do not include information about the remaining\naggravators in the Texas statute. But murders involving the remaining aggravators--such as killing a\nfirefighter, killing a judge, killing a witness to prevent the person from testifying, killing during a\nprison escape, hiring a hit man, and kidnapping the victim--are less common. Also, such defendants\nwould already be counted as death-eligible if the murder involved an aggravator that is included in the\nSHR data. For example, a defendant who kidnapped the victim would often be counted as death-eligible\nfor raping or robbing the victim (or killing a child, or killing multiple victims, and so forth).\nNonetheless, the fact that some Texas aggravators are not included in the SHR data means that the\ndenominator in the death sentence rate is an undercount. Yet such an \"error\" actually produces a\nconservative estimate of the death sentence rate: if more death-eligible defendants were added to the\ndenominator then the death sentence rate would be even lower.\nTo be eligible for death a defendant must also be arrested, convicted, and 18 or older at the time of\nthe crime based on the Court's decision in Roper v. Simmons (2005) [54]. To determine if a suspect\nwas arrested we follow the convention in the field; if the SHR data do not include the race and sex of\nthe suspect then we assume that the suspect has not been arrested [55]. Because the Bureau of Justice\nStatistics (BJS) indicates that 81% of the defendants who are arrested for murder are convicted, we\nassume that the same percentage holds true in our data [56]. Finally, the SHR data report the age of the\ndefendant, so we eliminated juveniles who were under 18 at the time of the crime (below, we also\nconsider whether codefendants were death-eligible).\n4. The Death Sentence Rate in Texas: A Conservative Approach\nRecall the Court's logic in Gregg: guided discretion statutes would solve the problem of\narbitrariness because state legislatures would narrow the pool of death-eligible defendants to \"the\nworst of the worst\" and most would be sentenced to death. If most death-eligible defendants were\n17 Fagan and colleagues [52] use a similar approach to determine death-eligibility in a study of deterrence.\n18 Homicide incidents coded in the SHR data as manslaughter by negligence were eliminated.\nsentenced to death then social and numerical arbitrariness would disappear. Do the empirical data\nTable 4 provides different estimates of the death sentence rate in Texas based on different\nassumptions about the data. Of the 8,173 defendants, Panel A reports that 1,820 committed a murder\nwith an aggravator. Of those with an aggravator, 1,524 were arrested. After eliminating juveniles,\n1,384 adult defendants were arrested for a murder that included an aggravator (if the age of the\ndefendant is missing in the SHR data then we assume the person is an adult; below, we change that\nassumption). Assuming a conviction rate of 81% reveals that 1,121 defendants were eligible for death\nHowever, the SHR data are missing the age of the defendant in 203 cases. Although most are probably\nadults, we cannot be sure. Consequently, the most conservative approach is to assume that the 203\ndefendants in question are juveniles and thus ineligible for death (such an approach inflates our\nestimate of the death sentence rate by reducing the pool of death-eligible defendants). Panel B reports\nour revised estimate. Specifically, the 1,384 adult defendants referenced above are reduced to 1,181\nrevising the denominator downward the death sentence rate only climbs to 4% (38/957). Turning to\nPanel C, we offer an even more conservative estimate of the death sentence rate. Here, we consider\nwhether codefendants should be considered death-eligible. In Enmund v. Florida (1982) and Tison v.\nArizona (1987) [57,58], the Supreme Court distinguished between minor participation and major\nparticipation in a capital murder, concluding that major participation is required to be eligible for\ndeath. Although most of the codefendants were probably major participants, we cannot be sure. So we\nassume that the 279 codefendants in question were minor participants and thus ineligible, again erring\non the side of caution. Still, reducing the denominator from 1181 defendants to 902 defendants and\nObviously, it is not reasonable to assume that all the defendants with missing data on age are juveniles\nor to assume that all the codefendants were minor participants. We do so to emphasize a key point: the\ndeath sentence rate in Texas from 2006 to 2010 falls substantially below the critical Furman threshold\nregardless of how the pool of death-eligible defendants is defined. Given that the substantive findings\nare robust across different specifications, we simplify our subsequent analyses by using the most\nconservative approach (based on the assumptions in Table 4, Panel C).\nPanel A.

Although Texas has 254 counties, just\nfour--Harris (Houston), Dallas (Dallas), Tarrant (Fort Worth and Arlington), and Bexar\n(San Antonio)--account for 532 of the 1,063 death sentences imposed in the state since Gregg [50].\nInterestingly, Table 5 reveals that the death sentence rate is about the same in the most active death\njurisdictions as the rest of the state, ranging from 2% to 10%. In fact, only 17 of the combined 435\ndeath-eligible defendants were sentenced to death--an overall death sentence rate of 4% in the\nselected counties.\nTable 5. Death Sentence Rate in Key Counties.\nCounty Major Cities Number Eligible After\nEliminating Codefendants\nand/or Age Unknown\nNumber\nConvicted\nNumber of\nDeath Sentences\nDeath\nSentence\nRate\nTarrant\nFort Worth and\nArlington\nWe also examine whether some aggravators are more constitutionally infirm than others. Table 6\nreveals that the death sentence rate falls below the critical threshold for the murder of a child (2%),\nmurder in the commission of a robbery-burglary (4%), and the murder of multiple victims (10%). But\nthe death sentence rate is much higher for murder by arson (40%), the murder of a police officer\n(40%), and murder in the commission of a sexual assault (42%). Such stark patterns are driven by an\ninverse relationship between the number of death-eligible defendants and the death sentence rate:\ncommon capital murders produce a lower death sentence rate, while rare capital murders produce a\nhigher death sentence rate (for more on the role of prevalence in sentencing see [59]).\nTable 6. Death Sentence Rate by Aggravator.\nAggravator Number Eligible After Eliminating\nCodefendants and/or Age Unknown\nNumber\nConvicted\nNumber of\nDeath\nSentences\nDeath\nSentence Rate\nTurning from numerical arbitrariness to social arbitrariness, we consider the influence of the\nvictim's characteristics on death sentencing. Decades of research indicate that the death penalty is\nmore likely to be imposed on behalf of white victims and, particularly, white female\ndeath-eligible defendants killed a white victim, yet 58% (22/38) of the defendants who were sentenced to\ndeath killed a white victim. Considering the intersection of the victim's race and gender produces\ndisparities that are even more striking: 11% of the death-eligible defendants killed a white female\nvictim, yet 32% (12/38) of the defendants who were sentenced to death killed a white female victim.\nThus, the rate of death sentencing on behalf of white victims is about double what one would expect if\nthe system were blind to race (58% versus 28%), and the rate of death sentencing on behalf of white\nfemale victims is about triple what one would expect if the system were blind to race and gender (32%\nTable 7. The Influence of Victim Race-Gender on Death Sentencing.\nVictim Race-Gender Eligible After Eliminating Codefendants and/or Age\nUnknown\nDeath\nSentence\nDefendant Killed White Female\nVictim\n19 Moving beyond numerical and social arbitrariness, geographical arbitrariness is also apparent. Of the 254 counties in\nTexas, just 120 have sent a defendant to death row since the decision in Gregg. Moreover, just 88 of the 254 counties\nare responsible for all executions since Gregg [50].\n5. Conclusions\nFor almost 40 years, the Court has attempted to regulate capital punishment. In Gregg, the Justices\nassumed that guided discretion statutes would solve the problem of arbitrariness identified in Furman.\nIf state legislatures narrowed the pool of death-eligible defendants to the \"worst of the worst\" then\nmost would be sentenced to death, eliminating arbitrariness. Yet numerous studies conclude that social\narbitrariness [24\u00ad26]. Summarizing the failure of regulation, Steiker and Steiker describe modern\ncapital punishment as the \"worst of all possible worlds\" ([12], p. 438). The authors note:\nThe Supreme Court's death penalty law, by creating an impression of enormous regulatory effort while\nachieving negligible regulatory effects, effectively obscures the true nature of our capital sentencing system,\nin which the pre-Furman world of unreviewable sentencer discretion lives on, with much the same\nconsequences in terms of arbitrary and discriminatory sentencing patterns ([12], p. 436).\nThe purpose of the current research is to add another piece of the puzzle regarding numerical\narbitrariness: Does the death sentence rate in Texas for the period from 2006 to 2010 fall below the\ncritical threshold established in Furman? Our estimates suggest that the statewide death sentence rate\nin Texas ranges from 3% to 5% depending on assumptions made about the data (the general pattern\nholds true in the small number of counties that send the most defendants to death row). The paltry\ndeath sentence rate is driven by aggravators--killing a child, killing during the commission of a\nrobbery-burglary, and killing multiple victims--that substantially enlarge the pool of death-eligible\ndefendants, but produce few death sentences. Though not the focus of our research, the data also\nsuggest that social arbitrariness remains--death was more apt to be imposed on behalf of white victims\nand, especially, white female victims. Thus, death sentencing in Texas appears to be patterned yet\nrandom--a biased fatal lottery. If true, perhaps the correct meteorological metaphor is a tornado rather\nthan a bolt of lightning; year after year, tornadoes cut a random path of destruction across the same\ngeographical areas.\nOne might react to the current research by calling for more death sentences. Such a response is\nproblematic for legal and practical reasons. From a legal perspective, the purpose of guided discretion\nstatutes was to eliminate arbitrariness by narrowing the pool of death-eligible defendants--not by\ndrastically increasing the number of death sentences. From a practical perspective, solving the\nconstitutional conundrum through sentencing is not realistic. If, hypothetically, a 50% death sentence\nrate would pass constitutional muster then Texas would need to sentence 10 to 15 times more\ndefendants to death during the time period in question. Beyond being implausible, such a strategy\nwould increase the risk of executing innocent defendants while doing nothing to address racial\ndisparities. The only solutions appear to be abolition or genuine legislative winnowing, perhaps\nrestricting death-eligibility to a small number of aggravators such as killing a police officer and killing\nduring the commission of a sexual assault (the death sentence rate for those aggravators is about 40%\nand would presumably increase if the statute were narrowed and prosecutorial resources were\nconcentrated on a smaller number of crimes).\nTo be sure, the current research is imperfect. Could our estimates of the death sentence rate be\nwrong? Two errors are possible: (1) The number of defendants sentenced to death for capital murders\nthat occurred in Texas from 2006 to 2010 could climb if investigations are continuing or trials are\nongoing. But the number of defendants added to the numerator would presumably be small. Consider\nthe following: of the 274 current death row inmates in Texas, 240 arrived within 3 years of the crime [50].\nThus, if we assume that the 38 defendants who have already been sentenced to death represent 88%\n(240/274) of the eventual total then the numerator in the death sentence rate could grow to 43\ndefendants (probably an overestimate given that most of the defendants in the data have had a longer\nperiod of time for the case to be disposed). (2) Our estimate of the denominator might also be slightly\noff the mark. Given the fact that the SHR data do not include information on all aggravators, we are\nmissing some death-eligible defendants. Conversely, some defendants who appear to be death-eligible\nmight be mentally retarded, and thus ineligible under Atkins v. Virgina (2002) [62]. The former number\nis probably greater than the latter number. If so, the denominator is still an undercount--meaning the true\ndeath sentence rate is even lower than our estimates suggest. Nonetheless, we follow our established\npractice of providing the most conservative estimate possible. Specifically, if we assume that the\nnumerator could expand to 43 defendants, and we assume that the denominator remains the same at\n731 defendants (based on the assumptions in Table 4, Panel C), then the maximum death sentence rate\nis 6% (43/731). Although pinpoint precision would be ideal, we submit that the death sentence rate is\nsimilar to horseshoes and hand grenades: if the most conservative possible estimate of the death\nsentence rate falls far below the critical threshold established in Furman then it is reasonable to\nconclude that the modern system of capital punishment in Texas is unconstitutional as currently\nadministered. Put differently, the imperfections in the data do not threaten our substantive conclusion.\nNot only do we provide a conservative estimate of the death sentence rate in Texas, we also provide\na conservative test of whether the modern American death penalty is a fatal lottery. Remember that the\ndeath sentence rate in Texas falls below the critical Furman threshold despite the absence of broad\naggravators found in most state statutes. Can we therefore conclude that the death penalty is imposed\narbitrarily in such states? After all, the states in question have enlarged the pool of death-eligible\ndefendants even more than Texas during an era of plummeting death sentences. The technical answer\nis no--empirical research is required in each jurisdiction to be certain. But our findings in Texas\nstrongly suggest that the modern American death penalty is a fatal lottery. Or, perhaps more fittingly,\nthe modern American death penalty is a tornado that kills predictably yet randomly.\nIt is important to note that the current research is just a beginning, as pivotal questions remain\nunanswered. Perhaps most centrally: has the death sentence rate in Texas changed over time from\nGregg to the present? Does the low death sentence rate observed from 2006 to 2010 represent a\ncontinuation or a significant downward departure? A steady state is possible. For example, the number\nof death sentences imposed in the 1990's was much higher than the 2000's, but so too was the overall\nhomicide rate. Nonetheless, death sentences have fallen even more precipitously than the overall\nhomicide rate, suggesting that the problem of numerical arbitrariness might be getting worse. 20\ntimes more homicides (or the homicide rate was 1.6 times higher).\nAnswering the question would require the disaggregation of death-eligible murders from all homicides\nin Texas from Gregg to the present, an important task that falls beyond the current research.\n"
