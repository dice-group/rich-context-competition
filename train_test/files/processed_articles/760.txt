Kaplan, DrPH,2 Margaret E. Adamek, PhD,2 and Olga Geling, MA2\nSuicide among older males has received increasing\nattention (e.g., Mclntosh, Santos, Hubbard, & Over-\nyounger males, and other racial/ethnic groups in the\nUnited States, white males 65 years and over have the\nhigh suicide risk among older white males prompted\nthe U.S. Public Health Service to include a mental\nheath initiative targeted at reducing the suicide rate\nin this group in its Healthy People 2000: National\nHealth Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives\nIn spite of the growing public attention to the\nmagnitude of this problem, little is known about the\nsociodemographic factors associated with suicide in\nlater life. Preventive strategies should be guided by\nan understanding of the demography of suicide (Cat-\ntell & Jolley, 1995). While it is well known that older\nwhite males often kill themselves with guns (e.g.,\nKaplan, Adamek, & Johnson, 1994), research has not\nexamined whether the likelihood of firearm suicide\nvaries across sociodemographic subgroups of this\npopulation. Available studies tend to be based on\naggregate-level data (Baker, O'Neill, Ginsburg, &\n1This research was supported by grant 94-148 from the Retirement Re-\nsearch Foundation.\n2University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, School of Social Work, 1207\nWest Oregon Street, Urbana, IL 61801.

And, few studies (e.g., Liu & Waterbor, 1994-\n95) have compared the risk of firearm suicide vs other\nmethods. Adamek and Kaplan (1996) found that age\nand race were correlates of firearm suicide among\nolder males, yet other factors -- such as socioeco-\nnomic status, marital status, and urban vs rural resi-\ndence -- have not been analyzed.\nAlthough available studies are informative, the\nquestion of which subgroups of older adults are\nmore likely to use firearms vs other methods to kill\nthemselves remains unanswered. The current study\novercomes the limitations of previous research by\nanalyzing the odds of suicide by firearm compared\nwith other methods across sociodemographic sub-\ngroups of older white males based on national,\nindividual-level data.\nMethods\nData derive from the Mortality Detail Files (1989-\n1991) compiled by the Division of Vital Statistics of\nthe National Center for Health Statistics from the\ndeath certificate files reported by each state. Causes\nof death were coded according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD), 9th revision, Clinical\nModification (NCHS, 1994). The following ICD codes\nrelatively low rate of suicide by methods other than\nfirearms, non-firearm methods were combined into\none category. Independent variables consisted of\n(metropolitan, nonmetropolitan), marital status\n(married, single, widowed, divorced), and education\n(less than high school, high school graduate). Educa-\ntion was used as a proxy measure of socioeconomic\nstatus. Death certificate data on educational attain-\nment were first reported in 1989. Education has been\nfound to be a stronger determinant of morbidity and\nmortality than other measures of social class (Hertz-\nman, Frank, & Evans, 1994). Although some studies\n(e.g., O'Donnell & Farmer, 1995) have highlighted\nthe limitations of official mortality statistics (i.e., un-\ndercounts and misclassifications), other studies have\nfound death certificate data to be valid and reliable\n(Havlik & Rosenberg, 1992; Sorlie, Rogot, & Johnson,\nDescriptive and logistic regression analyses were\nconducted. Descriptive statistics included actual\nnumbers and rates (derived from the number of\nsuicides divided by census estimates of the popula-\ntions at risk) of suicide among older white males by\nfirearms and other methods. Multiple logistic regres-\nsion analysis allowed the examination of the direct\neffects of sociodemographic predictors of suicide by\nfirearm vs other methods after adjusting for potential\nconfounding factors. The resulting odds ratios com-\npared the likelihood of firearm suicide in the pres-\nence of a certain sociodemographic characteristic to\nthe likelihood of firearm suicide in the absence of\nthat characteristic. Odds ratios smaller or larger than\n1.00 indicate a lesser or greater likelihood of firearm\nsuicide.\nResults\nSuicide by firearm was more prevalent than suicide\nby other methods across all the sociodemographic\nsubgroups examined. Of the 14,887 cases of suicide\n77% were committed with firearms and 23% with\nother methods. Table 1 presents the numbers and\nrates of firearm and non-firearm suicides by socio-\ndemographic subgroups for the three-year period.\nThe overall rates of suicide for white males 65 and\nover by firearms and non-firearms were 34.55 and\nTable 2 presents the adjusted odds ratios which\nindicate the likelihood of using firearms vs non-\nfirearms to commit suicide across the subgroups.\nThe logistic regression analysis revealed four demo-\ngraphic subgroups at a significantly (p < .0001)\nhigher risk of firearm suicide.\nAmong suicide cases, firearms were significantly\nmore likely to have been used by white males 65\nthrough 84 than by those 85 and over.

Firearms were\nsignificantly more likely to have been the method of\nsuicide among married, divorced, and widowed than\namong single white males. Whereas married males\nhad lower rates than those who were single, the\nproportion of suicides involving guns was higher\namong married (78%) than among single (66%) males\n(Table 1). Compared with individuals who have com-\npleted a high school education, those with less than a\n12-year education were more likely to have com-\nmitted suicide by firearms. In a separate analysis of\ninteractions, we found that the effects of residence,\nmarital status, and education on the use of firearms\nvs other methods of suicide did not vary significantly\nacross the three age groups.\nDiscussion\nPrevious research has shown that white males age\n65 and over have the highest suicide rate, and that\nfirearms are the most likely method used. The\npresent study identified specific demographic sub-\ngroups of this population most at risk for committing\nsuicide by firearm. After controlling for relevant fac-\ntors, the analysis revealed that those who were of\nlower socioeconomic status (as measured by educa-\ntion); living in nonmetropolitan areas; married, di-\nvorced, or widowed; and in the 65-84 age group\nwere more likely to choose firearms than other meth-\nods to kill themselves. These findings corroborate\nmortality data from Alabama.\nWhile among the three age groups, white males 85\nand over had the highest rates of suicide -- both by\nfirearms and other methods -- they were signifi-\ncantly less likely to use firearms than those 65 to 84.\nPoor adjustment to physical and financial losses in\nearly retirement might help explain the increased\nrisk of suicide by firearms among young-old males.\nAccording to Miller (1979), \"retirement shock\" is a\nmajor precipitating factor in suicide of elderly males.\nThe greater likelihood of suicide by firearms among\nolder white men in nonmetropolitan areas may be\nunderstood by their higher rate of gun ownership. In\nnearly 8 out of 10 white males 65 and over living in\nrural areas reported gun ownership compared to 1\nout of 2 in urban areas. Compared to single individ-\nuals, married as well as widowed and divorced white\nmen were at greater risk of committing suicide by\nfirearm. Concern for leaving a spouse destitute due\nto the economic burden of long-term illness (Butler,\nLewis, & Sunderland, 1991) or the stress of losing a\nspouse through death or divorce may heighten the\ndetermination of married, widowed, and divorced\nmales, respectively, to kill themselves and thus\nchoose a gun. As with nonmetropolitan residence,\nlower socioeconomic status as a predictor of firearm\nsuicide may reflect in part the higher rate of gun\nownership: 64% of white males 65 and over without a\nhigh school degree compared to 48% of those with a\nClearly, the prominence of firearms as a method of\nsuicide among older white males needs to be ac-\nknowledged and responded to on a wider scale. The\nrise in the number of older white males committing\nsuicide with firearms is particularly problematic be-\ncause these highly lethal instruments provide little or\nno chance for rescue (Kellermann, Lee, Mercy, &\nBanton, 1991). The U.S. Public Health Service has set\na national goal of reducing the overall suicide rate in\nrequire solutions targeted at reducing the availability\nof firearms (Sacks, Mercy, Ryan, & Parrish, 1994).\nSeveral individuals have called for a public health\napproach targeted at the environmental conditions,\ni.e., firearm availability, contributing to the high rate\nof suicide among older white males (e.g., Hendin,\nshown that the rate of firearm suicide can be reduced\nby limiting access to guns (Clarke & Lester, 1989;\nFischer, Comstock, Monk, & Sencer, 1993; Keller-\nmann et al., 1991). Ready accessibility to guns in the\nhome increases the risk of firearm suicide (Keller-\nmann et al., 1992). Clearly, effective preventive inter-\nventions require the identification of specific sub-\ngroups of older adults at greatest risk of firearm\nsuicide.\nReferences\nAdamek, M., & Kaplan, M. (1996).
