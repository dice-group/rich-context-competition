    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article analyzes 12 years of recent scholarly research on consumer behavior published in the five leading international\njournals in this field. Analyzing academic contributions to a specific area of research provides valuable insights into how it has\nevolved over a defined period. The approach was to briefly discuss content analysis and its application in scholarly literature\nreview studies. The methodology used here involves the classification of topics to evaluate key trends in consumer behavior\nliterature. It includes a ranking of topics published, typology of the published articles, the research classification in terms of\nmethodologies, and analysis techniques. The most cited articles in the field and within each journal are also examined. The\ncomprehensive literature review of consumer behavior research undertaken in this article could advance the discipline of\nconsumer behavior research by elucidating the evolution of consumer behavior literature in the studied period.\n",

Literature on consumer behavior is diverse and exten-\nsive as changes in society, economics, and technology affect\nthe way consumers behave.\nInevitably, these changes lead to changed consumer\nbehavior studies by which, when, how, and why the topics\nare studied. Like any other discipline, systematic analysis of\nthe knowledge development status of consumer behavior\nfield is critical in ensuring its future growth (Williams &\nPlouffe, 2007). It is of a greater importance for a field of\nresearch such as consumer behavior that, as MacInnis and\nFolkes (2010) claimed, is thriving by the growing number of\narticles and topics examined. One way of conducting this\nsystematic analysis is through studying scholarly literature,\nwhich can illustrate a discipline's intellectual history\n(Pasadeos, Phelps, & Kim, 1998). In this regard, to assess a\ndiscipline's accrued knowledge, in-depth reviews of research\npublished in peer-reviewed journals are the most relevant\nand useful resources (\u00dcsdiken & Pasadeos, 1995; Williams\n& Plouffe, 2007). The importance of consumer behavior in\nthe different disciplines of business literature also suggests\nthe need for an up-to-date look at the literature in this field.\nBeyond helping consumer behavior scholars and practitio-\nners develop a better understanding of the direction in which\nthe field is progressing and identify the gaps, such studies\nwill provide a guideline for them in positioning their future\nresearch and marketing efforts.\nIn this regard, a technique such content analysis, which\ncan be used to analyze message content and handling, is ideal\nfor conducting such literature review studies. As an observa-\ntional research method, content analysis systematically eval-\nuates the symbolic content of all forms of recorded\ncommunications (Sattari, 2012). It can be considered as an\nempirical starting point generating new research evidence\nabout the nature and effect of specific communications\n(Kolbe & Burnett, 1991; Vallet-Bellmunt, Mart\u00ednez-\nFern\u00e1ndez, & Cap\u00f3-Vicedo, 2011). Content analysis not only\nhelps identify central issues to the field but can also help to\nreveal areas where more work needs to be undertaken, par-\nticularly if these are considered to be important and defining\nissues in the discipline (Cokley, Caldwell, Miller, &\nMuhammad, 2001). Such integrative review of consumer\n1Linnaeus University, Vaxjo, Sweden\n2Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nKaveh Peighambari, Department of Marketing, School of Business and\nEconomics, Linnaeus University, 35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.\nEmail: kaveh.peighambari@lnu.se\nConsumer Behavior Research:\nA Synthesis of the Recent Literature\nKaveh Peighambari1, Setayesh Sattari1,\nArash Kordestani2, and Pejvak Oghazi1\n Keywords\nconsumer behavior, content analysis, literature review, consumer behavior research, trends\n2 SAGE Open\nbehavior research as a diverse discipline with an overwhelm-\ning scope in peer-reviewed journals is necessary if the field\nis to progress in a systematic fashion. Moreover, although\ncontent analysis of journals can be time-consuming and data\nintensive, such studies provide direction into future areas of\nneeded inquiry in the field by offering insight about the topi-\ncal, methodological, and theoretical trends into research\nAccording to Buboltz, Miller, and Williams (1999), an\nexamination of articles published in a journal reveals the trends\nand issues that impact the discipline.Acontent analysis of jour-\nnal articles within a specific discipline allows for an examina-\ntion of the kinds of topics that are deemed important to the\nparticular field the journal represents (Cokley et al., 2001). In\nconsumer studies, marketing research, and other business dis-\nciplines, literature investigations can also provide insights into\nthe specific journals' contributions to the field as well as the\nspecific published works (Sattari, 2012). This, in turn, can be\nused to describe a discipline's intellectual history (Pasadeos\net al., 1998). A comprehensive content analysis of peer-\nreviewed journal publications in a field encourages the scholars\nto assess the entire \"forest\" of knowledge by taking a step back\nfrom their individual \"trees\" (Williams & Plouffe, 2007).\nSuch studies have been conducted within a variety of disci-\nplines based on publications in the most respected journals.\nstudies reporting on the impact of advertising on researchers\nduring different periods of time. Buboltz et al. (1999) and\nCokley et al. (2001) have contributed similar studies in psy-\nchology. Others have targeted the consumer behavior field such\nas the studies done by Kassarjian (1977) and Helgeson, Kluge,\nMager, and Taylor (1984), but there is no current review of the\nfield. Therefore, given the importance of consumer behavior\nresearch, a comprehensive literature study of more recent con-\ntributions to this area of research is warranted.\nIn this regard, this article serves to assess the structure and\nevolution of consumer behavior research content in business\ndisciplines. The purpose of this literature review is to system-\natically review consumer behavior research over a 12-year\nperiod in five major journals in the field. Such an examination\nof diverse research in this discipline allows for identification of\nshifts and changes in a longitudinal manner. This article pres-\nents the results of a comprehensive content analysis covering\n12 years of research in the domain of consumer behavior. Our\nreview, which evaluated more than 1,000 articles published\nacross five key journals, provides a descriptive snapshot of the\nstatus of consumer behavior research including the most domi-\nnant topics based on Helgeson et al.'s (1984) framework and\nmethodological and analytical approaches, in addition to cita-\ntion statistics of the reviewed consumer behavior articles.\nMethod\nTo examine the content of consumer behavior literature,\ntrace its evolution, and identify the main streams of research\nover time, a content analysis was first performed on the arti-\ncles focusing on consumer behavior. Helgeson et al. (1984)\nclassified 32 years of consumer behavior literature from\nselected journals and proceedings. As there did not seem to\nbe a comprehensive review and classification of consumer\nbehavior topics in the literature, they tried to rectify the situ-\nation by examining the evolution of consumer behavior lit-\nhas been carried out since 1981, so this study replicates\nHelgeson et al.'s work based on the framework proposed by\nBerthon, Pitt, Ewing, and Carr (2002) by extending its con-\nThe purpose of this article is, therefore, to cover 12 years\ngrowth as a research topic in the literature. Like Helgeson\net al. (1984), our objective is not to evaluate the results of the\nresearch but to categorize and evaluate trends as found in the\nfollowing publications: (a) Journal of Consumer Research\n(JCR), (b) Journal of Marketing (JM), (c) Journal of\nMarketing Research (JMR), (d) Journal of Advertising (JA),\nand (e) Journal of Advertising Research (JAR).\nThe choice of these five journals is straightforward as\nthey have held positions as the top consumer behavior jour-\nnals and business journals for decades. Evidence of this\ncomes from many sources, such as the ABS' (Chartered\nAssociation of Business Schools) Academic Journal Quality\nGuide Studies evaluating these journals at the top level of\nbusiness journals.\nEvidence is also available from the Web of Science Internet\nlibrary source and Thomson Reuters journal citation reports,\nboth measuring the influence of publications based on impact\nfactors (defined as the frequency with which articles from a\njournal have been cited). The last journal citation report from\nWeb of Science (2014) shows that JCR (5-year impact factor\nof 5), JM (5-year impact factor of 7.42), JMR (5-year impact\n(5-year impact factor of 2.54) have consistently been posi-\ntioned as top influential business journals (Journal Citation\nReports, 2014). Moreover, the idea behind choosing these\njournals was to cover various disciplines among business stud-\nies such as marketing, advertising, and consumer research.\nChoosing these five journals also helped to evaluate articles\npublished by different publishers, namely, the American\nMarketing Association (AMA), Oxford University Press,\nTaylor & Francis, and World Advertising Research Center.\nMoreover, as claimed by Furrer, Thomas, and\nGoussevskaia (2008), established influential journals, such\nas the ones chosen in this study, set the bar for studies within\ntheir frame of reference by forming the theoretical and\nempirical work in their discipline.\nHowever, it must be said that notable contributions to\nconsumer behavior research have come from other sources,\nparticularly books and monographs, which we did not exam-\nine. In total, 2,915 articles published in the five journals dur-\ning the period under study were included in our review.\nPeighambari et al. 3\nThe first decision made by each reviewer was whether the\narticle dealt with consumer behavior. Hence, in the initial phase\nof this research, the authors manually reviewed every issue of\nthe five examined journals to identify articles for inclusion in\nthe analysis. First each article's title, abstract, and keywords\nwere evaluated, and if they included consumer behavior (or\nbehaviour), then the article would be on the list for further anal-\nysis. In many cases, this criterion was not met so the full article\nwas inspected and skimmed through to determine whether that\nthe article was related to consumer behavior.Avery small num-\nber of publication entries, such as editorials, points of view,\nabstracts, and book reviews, were excluded from the analysis.\nIn total, this identification phase yielded a sample of 1,263 con-\nsumer behavior articles (Table 1).\nThe second phase of the study involved systematically\ncategorizing the major aspects of each chosen article. Both\ndeductive and inductive procedures were conducted to deter-\nmine the categories used in the content analysis of the arti-\ncles.The initial inclusion of content topics relied on deductive\nprocedures, meaning that the reviewed consumer behavior\narticles were classified into 37 topics, which were divided\ninto four major areas, Internal, Purchase Process, External,\nand Miscellaneous (Table 1), as previously determined by\nHelgeson et al. (1984). This categorization can be explained\nthrough Wright's (2006) perspective in that the variety of\nhuman internal factors, external environment, and problem-\nsolving processes should be identified when trying to under-\nstand consumer behavior. Accordingly, the Internal category\ncovers topics associated with consumers'individual and psy-\nchological factors, whereas the topics categorized under\nExternal involve situational and social factors.\nTo ensure consistent classification of multitopic articles,\nin cases where an article could be classified under more than\none topic, the authors discussed the article and obtained a\nconsensus about the closest topic, which the article covered.\nThen, each article was classified based on its research typol-\nogy as being either qualitative, quantitative, or both. In the\nnext step, by using Google Scholar, the number of citations\nfor each selected article was gathered.\nArticles were further categorized according to research\nmethodology. Helgeson et al. (1984) used a group of four\nmethods: Survey, Experiment, Discussion, and Other.\nInductive procedures were used to develop additional catego-\nries for the articles' methodologies and analysis techniques.\nThis was done by each author independently reviewing the\ncontents of articles they were assigned and then meeting and\nTable 1.

The inductive procedures resulted in\nadding a new separate category to the research methods (case\nstudy) and one to the analysis techniques (structural equation\nmodeling [SEM]).\nAnalysis and Results\nThe number of consumer behavior articles during the studied\nin 2009 (Table 1). These numbers as a percentage of total\narticles appearing in the literature in the five selected jour-\nnals are illustrated in Figure 1.\nAt least three characteristic life-cycle patterns seemed to\nemerge, when plotting the percentage of consumer behavior\narticles devoted to each of four major areas over time (Figure\n2). The first pattern is exemplified by External area, which,\ndespite its consistent appearance in the literature, showed a\ndecline in the number of articles compared with the other\nthree areas. This pattern for External topics is negatively\nskewed with periodic peaks through time.Asecond pattern is\nexhibited by Internal topics, which are still in a growth stage\nshowing a gradually increasing interest in the literature. The\nskewness for pattern is positive without any significant peri-\nodic peaks through time. The Purchase Process area revealed\na third pattern, which is also positively skewed but with\nsome periodic and major peaks through time. Despite a\ndecline in the height of these peaks over time, the Purchase\nProcess topics remain an important part of the literature, and\nthis trend is growing.\nTable 2 exemplifies the frequency and percentage of arti-\ncles that each of the main area of topics covered compared\nwith the reviewed articles in consumer behavior fields in the\nreviewed journals.\nAs mentioned above, 37 major topics in consumer behav-\nior were selected in categorizing articles, which were then\ngrouped into four major areas. Using these categories, Table\n3 shows the percentage of occurrence of each topic within\nthe reviewed consumer behavior articles.\nAccording to the findings, the most studied topic within\nconsumer behavior articles in the five journals was\nPerception, which was covered in 12% of the articles. Only\nslightly less common, Attitudes came next (11.5%), while\nthe third topic, at almost half the size of the preceding two,\nwith 6.2%, was Brand awareness/loyalty.\nIn Table 3, bold fonts highlight the most studied topic in\neach major area. As discussed earlier, the present study clas-\nsified articles based on their research typology, methodol-\nogy, and the data analysis techniques used. Findings revealed\nthat a large number of the reviewed consumer behavior arti-\ncles were classified as quantitative studies (76%), as shown\nin Table 4. To dig deeper into this matter, we also evaluated\nthe relationship between the types of studies (qualitative and\nquantitative) with respect to the four topic categories as\nshown in Table 5.\nMoreover, according to the research methodology, experi-\nments and surveys were the most common instruments for\nconducting consumer behavior research. This can be\ndescribed as the nature of consumer behavior as related to\nstudying and observing consumers. The articles were also\nFigure 1. Trend of total and consumer behavior articles.\nPeighambari et al. 5\nFigure 2. Occurrence of four major areas of topics in consumer behavior over time (%).\nclassified by using one of the previously mentioned 10 ana-\nlytical techniques. Table 6 presents the frequency and per-\ncentage of each research methodology and the analysis\ntechniques used in the reviewed articles.\nMoreover, Table 7 shows the trends regarding analytical\ntechniques used during the 12 years studied as the percentage\nof all consumer behavior articles in each year.\nIn comparison with the study done by Helgeson et al. in\n1984, there has been tremendous growth in the use of com-\nplex statistical techniques such as SEM. This may be due to\nthe fact that these techniques involve advanced computer\nsoftware and packages that did not exist in 1984. It may\nalso be the result of an increase in the number of consumer\nbehavior articles that conducted scientific hypothesis test-\ning generated from a theory base. The complexity of the\narticles written has also witnessed an increase due to grow-\ning emphasis on theoretical foundations and multivariate\nstatistics, linked to advances in computer manipulation of\ndata. Thus, to comprehend the more recent consumer\nbehavior articles, readers are required to have a greater\nknowledge of the theoretical roots of articles and more\nstatistical sophistication than had been necessary for earlier\narticles.\nAnother consequence of the data analysis concerns arti-\ncles that have been cited the most often in consumer behav-\nior literature. Table 8 shows the 15 most cited articles in all\njournals, whereas Table 9 illustrates the three most influen-\ntial articles from each journal.\nConclusion\nThe results presented in this article suggest many impli-\ncations for the consumer behavior research community,\nresearchers, journal editors, and reviewers, as well as for\nthe practitioners. In this regard, this article not only\nserves to evaluate the structure and evolution of the lit-\nerature in consumer behavior field but also presents some\nassumptions about further developments in this\nliterature.\nBy helping consumer behavior scholars to better under-\nstand the direction in which the field is going, the article is\nintended to provide a guideline for scholars in positioning\ntheir future research efforts. The results of this article pro-\nvide consumer behavior researchers with a concrete perspec-\ntive on what has been published on the subject area by\nindicating hot topics, research methods, and analysis tech-\nniques. The findings of this study highlight the most impor-\ntant consumer behavior topics and the most influential\narticles in the field based on citation frequency. The number\nof topics studied in consumer behavior showed a dramatic\ngrowth and revealed some general patterns during the 12\nyears studied in this article.\nTable 2.

Moreover, potential authors, researchers, and\ninterested readers may use the information presented as a\nmeans to assess the field.\nThe findings of this research also provide journal editors\nand reviewers with a wider (global, in a sense) perspective\nregarding the publication trends and themes on consumer\nbehavior research topics, methods, and statistical analysis.\nPractitioners can use this study to indicate which journals\nto consult as sources of information on specific topics. The\nanalysis of the topic areas among the reviewed articles pro-\nvides evidence that certain topic areas (Purchase Process and\nInternal) enjoyed consistent popularity among the chosen\njournals' editors and reviewers during the studied years,\nTable 3.

This\nis in line with the ever-changing environment of consumers'\ndecision making and the move from profit-focused perspec-\ntive of companies to a relationship-focused one to increase\nloyalty. This seems to be in line with the evolution of con-\nsumers' preferences too, meaning that scholarly work in\nthese journals has recognized this change and has begun to\ninvestigate these changes in consumer behavior.\nLimitations and Avenues for Future Research\nWhile the content analysis conducted in this study provides\nuseful information to consumer behavior researchers and\npractitioners, several limitations of the study must be indi-\ncated. First, the five journals analyzed here do not represent\nthe entire body of consumer behavior research.

Furthermore, this article reviewed consumer\nbehavior studies published in a specific period. Extending\nthis time frame would, of course, strengthen the results and\ntheir generalizability.\nMoreover, as Yale and Gilly (1988) argued, any content\nanalysis may, to some extent, have a learning bias, meaning\nthat when the judges (in our case the authors of the article)\nreview more articles, they become more skillful and intui-\ntive, which may result in a different manner of inspection for\nthe articles evaluated earlier versus the ones assessed later in\nthe process. As the reviews of the articles done in this study\nare based on the judgments of its authors, further research\nmay come up with new and slightly different results.\nTherefore, a more systematic and transparent coding scheme\nis recommended for future study.\nFuture studies of the consumer behavior research litera-\nture can also investigate authorship of the articles, including\nwhich authors have had what impact on the discipline and\nwhich scholars from which institutions have been productive\nin terms of consumer behavior publications. Finally, future\nresearch can investigate and categorize the results and the\nimplications of articles in each topic, as well as the theories\nthat have been used or applied in those studies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArndt, J.
