    "abstract": "Abstract\nSince 2005, education in the Kingdom of Bahrain has undergone major reforms as part of the National Education Reform\nProject to achieve the goals of Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030. The Education & Training Quality Authority (BQA) was\ncreated by a Royal Decree as an independent entity established that is responsible for ensuring quality in education and\ntraining in the Bahrain. The Directorate of Government Schools Review (DGS) is under the umbrella of BQA and responsible\nfor conducting quality reviews for all Bahraini government schools. Upon successfully completing two cycles of school\nreviews (review cycle average is 4 years), this article compares the findings of two DGS review cycles. In December 2014,\nthe DGS completed its second review of 206 schools. Generally, the results showed an increase in the polarity of the ratings.\nAnalysis of the results showed the following: In terms of schools' environments, it is generally safe with equal infrastructure\nand learning resources among most schools; the performance gap between male and female students is widening; the\nfield of technical and commercial education still faces challenges; parental involvement is limited, despite opportunities\nfor participation; and available technology is used inconsistently. In addition, some schools that are judged inadequate face\nincreased challenges to improvement.\n",

During\nthe last three decades, more emphasis was placed on linking\nthe goals of national economic growth to educational quality,\nfocusing on preparing students to be fit for a continuously\nchanging market (Ladd & Loeb, 2013). Therefore, educa-\ntional policies encouraged educational systems to offer\ngreater freedom in moving toward more decentralized edu-\ncational management systems, with an emphasis on increased\naccountability to external stakeholders (MacBeath, 2006).\nThis accountability is to be guided by clear criteria and a\nframework that is understood and agreed upon by various\nstakeholders.\nQuality reviews and inspections vary between educational\nsystems around the world in accordance with their individual\nneeds and backgrounds (Brundrett & Rhodes, 2011). The\nreview framework adopted by DGS in the Kingdom of\nBahrain is based on the philosophy of professional develop-\nment through performance review by \"critical friends.\"\nThese critical friends are peers in the field of education who\nhave considerable experience in teaching and managing\nschools. The criteria by which schools are judged are consid-\nered to be generic; however, molding schools into the same\nway of doing things is not the aim. Rather, the purpose of the\nevaluation is to improve students' academic performance\nand enhance their personal development. The model adopted\nby the DGS is published in the Schools Review Handbook\nand is based on the following three components (BQA,\n1. Quality of outcomes\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Students' academic achievement\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Students' personal development\n2. Quality of main processes\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Teaching and learning\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Support and guidance\n3. Quality assurance of outcomes and processes\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Leadership, management, and governance.\nAfter judging the quality of each of the above aspects,\nreviewers examine schools' overall effectiveness and capac-\nity to improve. The DGS developed a classification system to\nexplain the criteria for each rating in detail and to ensure that\nthe performance of each school is evaluated according to the\nsame standards. The classifications are as follows (BQA,\n1. Outstanding: This judgment is awarded if the prac-\ntices of all or the vast majority of those related to the\ncriteria are diverse and of quality and highly produc-\ntive. Performance and initiatives taken are excep-\ntional and significantly exceed expectations. It\nlargely reflects improvement and development and\ncan be considered as a model to be followed.\n2. Good: This judgment is awarded if the practices of\nmost of those related to the criteria are diverse and of\nquality and productive. Performance is effective, and\ninitiatives are ongoing and sometimes exceed expec-\ntations. It largely reflects improvement and\ndevelopment.\n3. Satisfactory: This judgment is awarded if the quality\nof the practices of the majority of those related to the\ncriteria is at an acceptable level, and performance and\ninitiatives are at the expected level and reflect some\nimprovement and development.\n4. Inadequate: This judgment is awarded if the quality\nof the majority of the practices of those related to the\ncriteria is at an inappropriate level, and the school's\nperformance is at a level less than expected. This\njudgment does not reflect any realistic expectation of\nimprovement.\nGeneral Finings\nDecember 2014 marked the end of Cycle 2 reviews, as DGS\nprimary-intermediate schools, 38 intermediate schools, and\n36 secondary and intermediate-secondary schools (BQA,\n2015). The overall effectiveness of government schools is\nillustrated in Figure 1. This article will not include the results\nof seven new government schools that had been reviewed\nduring Cycle 2 only; consequently, this comparison will\nThe main themes of the review findings are as follows.\nIncrease in Polarity of Ratings\nAn increase in the polarity of the ratings was observed in\nCycle 2, in which the percentage of \"outstanding\" schools\nincreased and the number of \"inadequate\" schools also\nincreased, particularly in the elementary stage, as illustrated\nin Figure 2. In Cycle 2, the rankings of some schools\nimproved by two levels; however, others reported a drop of\nthe same degree. This was related in many cases to the level\nof the effectiveness of school initiatives and external follow-\nup and support provided to schools. On the contrary, the\ndecline may have been influenced by multiple factors,\nFigure 1. Overall effectiveness--comparing the 206 schools\nreviewed in Cycle 2.\nincluding student academic levels at entry in different stages\nand the quality and stability of leadership including senior\nand middle management.\nOverall Performance of Various School Levels\nImprovements in the secondary level are the most notable\nsuccess story in Cycle 2 when compared with Cycle 1.\n\"Inadequate\" school ratings decreased from 47% to 22%,\nand the \"outstanding\" rating remained constant at one sec-\nondary school in each cycle of reviews, as shown in Figure 3.\nPrimary schools demonstrated a clear example of grade\npolarity; the number of \"outstanding\" and \"inadequate\" rat-\nings almost doubled between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, as shown\nin Figure 4.\nThe intermediate level was a point of concern for the\nDGS. A 9% decrease was observed in the number of \"satis-\nfactory\" schools, as well as an 8% increase in the number of\n\"inadequate\" schools led the total of \"inadequate\" intermedi-\nate schools to be 37%. \"Good\" and \"outstanding\" schools\ndid not make any progress, as indicated in Figure 5.\nTable 1 charts the general distribution of schools by level,\nrating, and gender. The girls' schools maintained their posi-\ntive progress over the boys' schools in the \"outstanding\" and\n\"good\" ratings. The boys'schools that were judged \"satisfac-\ntory\" in the primary level and \"inadequate\" in all levels\nincreased over the girls' schools.\nPerformance of Schools: Analytical\nReview\nThe most influential factors on the performance of schools as\nanalyzed in more than 400 review reports and as observed in\nthe two cycles of review were as follows:\nSenior Leadership\nRecommendations for leadership, management, and gov-\nernance focused on the ability of school management\nteams to conduct accurate and comprehensive self-evalua-\ntions and use the results to formulate a strategic plan and\nfollow it up. It also focused on the preparation and\nFigure 2. Overall effectiveness--comparing the 199 schools\nreviewed in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.\nFigure 3.

In addition, instability in senior\nmanagement positions had a direct impact on the perfor-\nmance of the schools. A number of schools, especially\nthose that were struggling, had experienced changes in\ntheir staffing up to 3 times between the first and second\nreview visits (an average of 3.5 years). The analysis shows\nthat these changes affected school ability to establish\neffective management and quality control systems, and in\nturn affected their development and progress. Results show\nthat \"outstanding\" schools had maintained stable staffing\nMiddle Management and Teaching Staff\nMiddle managers--senior teachers in Bahrain--significantly\nimpact classroom practices by observing teachers' perfor-\nmance and organizing professional development to ensure\ngood teaching processes. Review teams reported shortages in\nmiddle management in a number of schools, which affected\nthe quality of class management and instructional differenti-\nation. In some schools, especially intermediate and second-\nary schools, shortages included senior teachers of core\nsubjects; this shortage was due to increasing subject special-\nization required and the nature and characteristics of this age\ngroup (13-18 years). The workload of senior teachers in\nschools was also affected by staffing changes, which required\nmore time to cope with low retention rates and more efforts\nto be spent developing teachers' performance.\nGap in Performance Between Male and Female\nStudents\nOverall, the gap in performance observed between boys and\ngirls in Cycle 1 remained consistent in Cycle 2. While this\ncomparison is a point of concern for many educational sys-\ntems internationally, its impact is especially impactful in the\nKingdom. The consequences of the discrepancy are reflected\nin communities, employment opportunities, and access\nequality in higher education sector in particular. As\nillustrated in Figure 6, \"outstanding\" ratings in girls' schools\nwere 6 times more prevalent than in boys' schools. Only 3%\nof girls' schools were rated \"inadequate,\" compared with\n24% of boys' schools. Reports analysis shows that this dis-\ncrepancy is partially attributed to the difference in perfor-\nmance levels between genders, relating to boys' lack of\nreadiness or motivation to learn. The quality of teaching and\nlearning practices in the schools may also have had an\nimpact. It is worth noting that the management and staffing\nof the \"outstanding\" and \"good\" primary schools consisted\nof females.\nThe School Environment\nThe school environment in Bahrain is generally safe, and\nmost schools have equal infrastructures and learning\nresources. This promotes equal learning opportunities for all\nstudents. Analysis results indicate that in many cases, new\nbuildings, facilities, and the availability of scientific technol-\nogy have had a direct impact on students'motivation to learn\nand progress. However, some schools lack science and com-\nputer laboratories and multipurpose halls. Few schools cov-\nered in this study face challenges related to inadequate\nbuildings or external hazards that threaten students' safety\nwhen they come to and go from school. These schools do not\nconstitute the majority; nevertheless, such shortages are sig-\nnificant to students' learning processes.\nTable 1.

Overall effectiveness--comparing the 206 boys' and\ngirls' schools reviewed in Cycle 2.\nTechnical and Commercial Education\nIn Bahrain, secondary education consists of four main tracks:\ntechnical, commercial, scientific, and literacy. Technical and\ncommercial education is an important component of devel-\noped educational systems, and its importance increases as\ncountries seek to transform their service sectors and move\ntoward knowledge-based economies. Analysis results indi-\ncate that, in general, students on the commercial track out-\nperformed their peers on the technical track. Students on the\ncommercial track showed weakness in basic skills in English\nand mathematics, whereas students on the technical track did\nnot meet the desired outcomes in their theoretical lessons,\nparticularly English, but performed better in practical lessons\nand showed more enthusiasm for those subjects. Students'\nknowledge of English and some theoretical subjects is fun-\ndamental for both the commercial and technical tracks;\ntherefore, it is important to reconsider the use of diagnostic\ntests and provide greater support based on students' ability\nlevels.\nRole of Parents\nParents have a significant role in driving teaching and learning\nprocesses and improving their children's academic achieve-\nment; they do this through following up their children prog-\nress, maintaining high expectations of them, and motivating\nthem to succeed. Analysis of reports shows that school man-\nagement teams are keen to collect and implement parents'sug-\ngestions and often formulate and activate parents' councils.\nHowever, poor participation limits their impact. Although\nmore than one quarter of the schools in this study were judged\nas \"inadequate,\" parents' satisfaction was judged as \"inade-\nquate\" in only 1% of schools. This reinforces that parents are\nnot aware of the impact of their active participation or that\nthey are poorly motivated to play more active role in their chil-\ndren learning. Parents' councils should be activated through\nconstructive and continuous discussions with teachers\nthroughout the school year, and deciding on appropriate learn-\ning experience starting points of students through addressing\naccurate analyses of their educational levels. In addition, par-\nents and teachers should jointly develop methods to achieve\ncompetencies that are in line with students' abilities.\nInput-Based Changes\nChanges in the number of students in Bahrain and their back-\ngrounds, social classes, or cultures were not accompanied\nwith needed level of support in developing teachers with\nsound induction programs to deal with students with special\nneeds. For instance, nonnative Arabic speakers, who com-\nprise more than 20% of the population in some schools, were\nnot matched with appropriate teacher training programs that\naddress the needs of these students, which obstructed stu-\ndents' progress.\nEducational Technology and Its Use\nIn this age of digital culture, technological skills are among\nthe most important for students. With regard to the use of\neducational technology, the analysis of review reports\nshowed, despite the availability of computer labs in the vast\nmajority of schools, that their use varied greatly.\n\"Outstanding\" and \"good\" schools employed IT, in addition\nto the use of blogs and websites, in their classroom practices\nto serve the teaching and learning processes. They also con-\nducted some formative tests electronically. In these schools,\nIT was also used for a portion of teachers' professional\ndevelopment programs. Review reports showed that students\ngenerally had moderate IT skills; for example, in the most\neffective schools, students initiated the transfer of some parts\nof the curriculum into e-lessons. However, such practices\nvaried among schools, especially those with \"satisfactory\"\nand \"inadequate\" ratings, in which the use of electronic pro-\njectors was the extent of IT that was observed. This limita-\ntion can impact students' academic progress. It is worth\nmentioning that the use of e-learning varies in accordance\nwith educational stages, and it was used more in primary\nschools than in the intermediate and secondary schools.\nIncrease in the Number of\n\"Inadequate\" Schools\nThe number of \"inadequate\" schools in Cycle 1 was 41, com-\npared with 55 in Cycle 2. This change negatively affects the\nachievement of Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030. The most\nimportant reasons for the increase in schools rated \"inade-\nquate\" include the following: the decline of students'academic\nachievement, as there was a noticeable variance between the\nstudents'pass rates and proficiency rates; a decline in students'\nacquisition of basic skills such as reading and writing inArabic\nand English, arithmetical skills in mathematics, and applied\nskills in science; weakness of students'personal development,\nas most students do not effectively participate in life at school,\nshow enthusiasm toward learning, or take on leadership roles.\nIn addition, other factors, as reports analysis show, include\nteaching- and learning-related problems, such as ineffective\nteaching strategies and poor classroom management. Also,\ninaccurate self-evaluation, poor strategic planning, the turn-\nover of school leaders, and ineffective professional develop-\nment programs for teachers were another factors contributed\nto the poor performance.\nNineteen schools were judged as being \"inadequate\" in\nboth cycles. These schools are still causing concern, and\norganizations must take immediate intervention actions.\nSuch actions may include employing more experienced\nteachers, ensuring close follow-up, improving parents'\nawareness, and acquiring the necessary support to address\nschools' specific needs to enhance outcomes and improve\nratings. It is important to remember that some students will\nreceive their entire education from \"inadequate\" schools.\n6 SAGE Open\nWays Forward\nThe comparison between the two cycles of reviews has\nrevealed several overall areas for improvement. Actions by\nregulatory bodies should\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Apply and develop the practices of the \"outstanding\"\nschools to ensure the sustainability of those schools'\nperformance and to propagate best practices in other\nschools;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Enable students to acquire basic skills in all educa-\ntional stages and tracks;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Ensure the improvement of \"inadequate\" schools'\nperformance, especially those that face challenges and\nhave received the same grade in two review cycles;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Consider the stability of schools' staff and address\nshortages in human resources, especially teachers of\ncore subjects and senior teachers;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Work on reducing the gap between boys' and girls'\nperformance and achievement in general, and work to\nmotivate boys to learn and achieve academically;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Offer support for students' needs across all different\nlevels through training and professional development\nprograms for staff;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Address the shortages of facilities and resources such\nas multipurpose halls, science labs, and technology, to\nestablish similar learning conditions among schools\nand facilitate better learning opportunities;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Encourage an e-learning culture among students, par-\nents, and teachers, enabling them to make optimal use\nof computer labs and other technology that supports\nthe teaching and learning processes;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Ensure the safety of buildings, as well as freedom\nfrom hazards that may threaten students' security dur-\ning their arrival and departure; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Increase parents' awareness of the importance of their\nparticipation in the educational process.\nAuthor's Note\nTo read the full report and different sectors' quality reviews in the\nKingdom of Bahrain, please see the Education & Training Quality\nAuthority's (BQA) 2015 annual report, available at www.bqa.gov.bh.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBahrain.
