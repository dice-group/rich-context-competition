Many articles (n = 1,747) were found that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nA total of 47 different methods were used to develop evidence for mental health occupational therapy, and evidence\nappeared in 300 separate peer-reviewed journals. It takes on average 7 months for an article to progress from submission\nto acceptance, and a further 7 months to progress from acceptance to publication. More than 95% of articles published\nbetween 2000 and 2002 were cited at least once in the following decade, and around 70% of these citations were recorded\nin non-occupational therapy journals. The current evidence base for mental health occupational therapy is both substantial\nand diverse.\n",

Peer-reviewed\njournals exist to promote research (Fricke, 2004), and include\nand promote many ways of knowing that are an essential\nresource for clinicians seeking to enact evidence-based prac-\nsources of evidence for mental health occupational therapy\nPrior to 2000, the American Journal of Occupational\narticles on mental health (n = 7) published as part of the\nAmerican Occupational Therapy Association's Centennial\nVision (D'Amico, Jaffe, & Gibson, 2010). The articles in this\nsmall sample addressed intervention effectiveness, instru-\nment development, and descriptive research. A review of\narticles published in the Indian Journal of Occupational\nand found 10 studies relevant to mental health practice\n(Acharya, 2013). Again, much of the evidence was descrip-\ntive (50%), although there were also several control trials\nincluded a very small percentage of the overall evidence base\nfor mental health occupational therapy. Their samples would\nhave been influenced by the publication policies of the single\njournals from which they were drawn.\nA retrospective analysis of evidence published in the\nOccupational Therapy Journal of Research covered 20 years\nwere found to be academics, and descriptive studies com-\nprised the largest proportion of articles published (23.7%).\nHowever, other methodologies were also well represented,\nparticularly correlation studies (23.8%) and quasi-experimen-\ntal studies (20.7%). Brown and Brown also investigated the\ncitations from these articles, and noted that journal articles\nwere substantially more likely to be cited than books (includ-\ning chapters). The journal \"Work\" conducted a 20-year\nreview of evidence that was published in it (Shaw, Campbell,\nJacobs, & Prodinger, 2010), and found that more than half of\ntheir articles reported on the psychometric properties of\nassessments. Conceptual articles made up 22% of the evi-\ndence in this journal. The profile of the journal \"Work\" is\nquite different from what was reported in the Occupational\nTherapy Journal of Research, where, for example, conceptual\narticles are not published.

Research into\nthe evidence for mental health occupational therapy to date\nhas been from peer-reviewed publications in a single journal\nor formed an undifferentiated part of more general reviews\nof occupational therapy evidence. An analysis of the evi-\ndence that is currently available to mental health occupa-\ntional therapists across a range of publications is needed to\nidentify what already exists and guide targeted research in\nthe future. From this knowledge, we can begin planning how\nto proceed with regard to the types of evidence we wish to\ndevelop and the stakeholders we wish to include in this\nprocess.\nIn a review of the evidence relevant to mental health\nwere explored. These were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: What sort of evidence has been\nResearch Question 2: What is the range of journals\nwhere this evidence is found?\nResearch Question 3: Where, how often, and how\nquickly are articles by occupational therapists about men-\ntal health occupational therapy in peer-reviewed journals\ncited?\nMethod\nSearch Strategy\nThis study used both descriptive and inductive methods to\naddress the research questions. Four databases (CINAHL,\nOTDBase, PSYCInfo, SCOPUS) and a search engine\n(Google Scholar\u00ae) were searched using terms designed to\ncapture a broad range of evidence relevant to mental health\noccupational therapy--\"occupational therapy\" AND (\"men-\ntal health\" OR \"mental illness\" OR \"psychiatry\").\nTo answer the first and second research questions, the\ninclusion criteria were as follows: (a) Articles formally pub-\nlished in English (either originally or available in translation);\n(c) articles published in peer-reviewed publications; (d) arti-\ncles where at least one author self-identified as an occupa-\ntional therapist, consumer of occupational therapy services,\nor organization representing the profession; and (e) articles\nfor which full text was available. The exclusion criteria were,\ntherefore, (a) articles formally published prior or subsequent\nto these dates, or only available as \"early access\" during this\ntime, and (b) articles published in non-peer reviewed\npublications.\nTo answer the third research question, a different search\nstrategy was used. The databases and search terms remained\nthe same; however, the search was limited to articles pub-\n2002) to enable enough time to elapse since publication for a\ncomprehensive analysis of impact on future research. If there\nwere going to be any citations as a result of a publication,\nyou could reasonably expect them to come within the first\ndecade. This led to the identification of 289 articles, a subset\nof the overall sample analyzed previously, on which the anal-\nysis around citations was undertaken.\nSample\nOne thousand forty-seven articles were found that met the\ninclusion and exclusion criteria. A system of classification\nwas developed to deconstruct the sample into a manageable\nform using Microsoft Excel. To extract relevant data for evi-\ndence in mental health occupational therapy from each arti-\ncle, 13 variables were used: author names, author designation,\nnumber of authors, year, title of article, journal, practice cat-\negory, practice sub-category, type of evidence, level of evi-\ndence (quantitative), level of evidence (qualitative),\nsubmission to acceptance (days), and acceptance to publica-\ntion (days). The practice categories and sub-categories were\nbased on both the International Classification of Diseases\nNo standardized taxonomy for defining areas of practice in\nmental health occupational therapy currently exists, and so\nthese categories were generated from the first author's under-\nstanding of practice across several countries (Australia,\nCanada, and the United Kingdom). Table 1 displays the clas-\nsifications used for practice categories used to deconstruct\nthe sample data. The category of ambiguous/mixed diagnosis\nwas used for studies where the participants' diagnoses were\nnot clearly recorded or the sample included people from a\nrange of diagnostic categories.\nData Analysis\nType and Level of Evidence\nAnalysis began with a careful reading of each article, using\nhighlighting and notes to identify the knowledge contained\nwithin. The article was classified according to the practice\ncategory it belonged to, and further classified according to\nrelevant sub-categories (see Table 1). Finally, all the evi-\ndence in each article was subjected to two further triage\nsteps, classifying it with regard to type and level of evidence.\nType of evidence was grouped into four classes of scientific\nevidence: quantitative, qualitative, mixed, and other evi-\ndence. For evidence that had been classified as \"other,\" no\nfurther classification was required. Articles in the first three\nHitch et al. 3\nclasses of scientific evidence were classified according to the\nlevel of evidence they presented.\nThe level of evidence for qualitative evidence was\nassigned using the Rosalind Franklin Qualitative Research\nAppraisal (RF-QRA) instrument (Henderson & Rheault,\n2004). Trustworthiness in the RF-QRAcomprises credibility,\ntransferability, dependability, and confirmability. Each com-\nponent of trustworthiness is measured on a 2-point scale\n(Yes/No). These scores contribute to the overall level of\ntrustworthiness, which varies between I and V (1 = trustwor-\nthiness confirmed for all four components, 5 = trustworthi-\nness confirmed for none of the components). Each piece of\nqualitative evidence was subjected to key questions, which\nwere as follows: (a) Credibility--Can you believe the\nresults? (b) Transferability--Can the results be transferred to\nother situation? (c) Dependability--Would the results be\nsimilar if the study was repeated? and (d) Confirmability--\nWas there an attempt to enhance objectivity by reducing\nresearch bias?\nIf evidence existed that supported that element of trust-\nworthiness, the study received one point for that element,\nwhich contributed to its ranking on a range of I to V. Unlike\nthe quantitative hierarchy of evidence to follow, this method\nis dependent on whether authors have reported their efforts to\nincrease trustworthiness in their publication. This reporting\ncan vary, and recommendations have been made for its adop-\ntion as a standard feature of qualitative research reports\nFor assignment of level of evidence for quantitative stud-\nies, the National Health and Medical Research Council\n(NHMRC; 2000) levels of evidence were used. Each quanti-\ntative study was assigned a ranking from I to V (I = system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis, V = expert opinion, including\nliterature/narrative reviews, consensus statements, descrip-\ntive studies, and individual case studies). Table 2 shows the\nRF-QRA instrument and NHMRC levels of evidence\ntogether, to illustrate how rigor was determined in this study.\nPublication Characteristics\nData analyzed for publication characteristics included\nauthors, year, article title, journal, and the number of authors\nrecorded. The affiliation of all authors on an article was clas-\nsified into one of three categories: academic only, clinician\nonly, or mixed. The number of days between submission and\nacceptance, and between acceptance and publication, were\nrecorded where these data were given. This information was\nimportant to understand how rapidly evidence was dissemi-\nnated and available for use by mental health occupational\ntherapists.\nTable 1.

Citations from all sources\n(i.e., peer-reviewed journal articles, books, gray literature)\nwere included in the citation count. In common with the\noverall project, citations in languages other than English\nwere excluded. A number of citations without any year\nrecorded were found, and these were excluded. Citations\nwere recorded on a year-by-year basis and grouped into\noccupational therapy and generic sources. In this study,\n\"generic\" journal sources are all those that do not have a\nspecifically occupational therapy focus or remit. To qualify\nas an occupational therapy source, the citation needed to be\nin an occupational journal or have occupational therapy in\nthe title.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data were analyzed using several groupings: across the\nentire sample, across a sub-category (such as Intervention/\nChild and Adolescent), or within a subset of a sub-category\n(such as qualitative data around Lived Experience/\nSchizophrenia). For each article, descriptive statistics\ndescribed the patterns and characteristics for each variable.\nInductive statistics were also used to analyze data relating to\nsome variables, with independent sample t tests applied.\nResults\nThe analysis for the first two research questions on type of\nevidence and source of evidence included the total sample of\n1,747 peer-reviewed articles.

For both intervention and lived experi-\nence, half of the categories displayed a trend toward consis-\ntently low numbers of articles. These categories were Drug\nand Alcohol, Mood (intervention), Anxiety, Personality/\nBehavior, and Ambiguous/Mixed Diagnoses (lived experi-\nence). However, articles about child and adolescent interven-\ntions (particularly autism) and organic interventions\n(particularly dementia) have steadily increased in recent\nyears. In addition, there has been a steady increase in the\nnumber of articles about the lived experience of people with\nmood disorders and schizophrenia.\nArticles about forensic, older adults and private practice\nprograms showed consistently low numbers of articles. As\nshown in Figure 2, there was an increasing trend for articles\nabout vocational programs, and articles about programs for\nchildren and adolescents, and for adults, both peaked in the\nmiddle of the first decade of this century. The reasons for\nthese peaks are not immediately clear, and may warrant fur-\nther investigation.\nWith regard to theory, there was an increase in articles\nabout conceptual practice models and related knowledge\ntoward the end of the first decade of the new millennium, but\nthis appears to have tailed off from 2012.\nTypes of Evidence\nMost of the evidence found was quantitative, as illustrated in\nA total of 47 different methods were used to develop evi-\ndence for mental health occupational therapy, and a full list\nis provided in the appendix. Many of these were used in sin-\ngle studies, and the top 10 methods spanned all types of evi-\ndence, as shown in Table 5.\nAs descriptive methods were the most frequently encoun-\ntered, it is unsurprising that the majority of the quantitative\nevidence available to mental health occupational therapists\nwas rated as Level V. However, as shown in Figure 4, the\nprofile for qualitative evidence was quite different, with the\nmajority being higher up the hierarchy.\nA different pattern emerged in the articles where mixed\nmethods were used. Both the quantitative and qualitative\nmethods tended toward the lower ends of each hierarchy, as\nillustrated in Figure 5.\nRange of Journals\noccupational therapy authors about mental health occupa-\ntional therapy.

Much of this evidence on programs\nfocuses on services for adults and vocational services, which\nmay be reflective of the professions priorities or simply\nwhere many occupational therapists are employed. With\nmomentum growing toward early intervention in mental\nhealth and aging populations in many Western nations, fur-\nther research supporting programs for children, adolescents,\nand older adults is both timely and required to support\npractice.\nMost of the evidence available to mental health occupa-\ntional therapists was produced using quantitative methods.\nHowever, a broad range of research methods was used, with\nthe top 10 cited articles including examples from all tradi-\ntions. Generally, the quantitative evidence was ranked in the\nbottom two levels of the hierarchy of evidence, while quali-\ntative evidence tended to be ranked higher in the second and\nthird tiers. Previous studies into patterns of evidence pub-\nlished in mental health have confirmed this pattern for quan-\nhowever, patterns in qualitative research have not been stud-\nied previously. Given qualitative evidence constitutes almost\none in five mental health occupational therapy studies pub-\nlished, great attention to its quality and distribution is\nwarranted.\nArticles using mixed methods tended to combine less rig-\norous methods from the bottom two levels of the hierar-\nchies. However, it could also be argued that the triangulating\neffect of using mixed methods, where the findings of each\nmethod are used to complement each other, acts to increase\nthe overall rigor of the study (independent of the rigor of the\nindividual methods).\nThe majority of articles written by occupational thera-\npists about mental health occupational therapy are cited,\nand those that are uncited tend to be in journals that are\ndifficult to access. This may become less of a problem in\nthe coming years, as the majority of journals move to elec-\ntronic formats and open access becomes more common.\nThe articles that were most cited included a large propor-\ntion addressing autism (particularly sensory processing). In\noccupational therapy practice, autism is more commonly\nassociated with pediatric occupational therapists, although\nit is classified in the ICD10 (and the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM]) as a mental\nhealth disorder. Along with autism, dementia has also been\nan area with increased publications in recent years, and is\nalso an area of occupational therapy practice where the\n\"physical\" and \"mental health\" sides of the profession are\nmore closely aligned.\nCitations for these articles were far more likely to be\nfound in generic journals, and there is a strong trend for\nongoing acceleration in citation rates in these publications.\nArticles that were originally published in generic journals\nwere cited statistically significantly more often than those in\noccupational therapy journals, and were also statistically sig-\nnificantly more often cited in the sub-group of generic jour-\nnals. However, those originally published in occupational\ntherapy journals were statistically significantly more often\ncited in occupational therapy journals. The impact of an arti-\ncle with regard to its chances of future citation is therefore\nsomewhat dependent on the place where the original article\nOT Citaons\nGeneric Citaons\nFigure 7. Number of citations by location.\nOT = occupational therapy.\nwas published. Whether this is a factor in the choice of jour-\nnal made by authors is currently unknown, and would be\ninstructive to clarify. However, it is clear that occupational\ntherapists should expand their searches beyond occupational\ntherapy literature to ensure they have access to all the latest\ndevelopments in the field.\nThe impact of an article on future research takes approxi-\nmately 3 years to appear using citation rates as a measure.\nArticles initially published in generic journals were cited in\ngeneric journals significantly more quickly than those pub-\nlished in occupational therapy journals. However, citation\ncounts are a relatively blunt instrument with which to mea-\nsure impact. Future research that follows the influence of the\ncontent of the evidence, by tracing the development of ideas\nthrough a line of articles on a particular subject, would be\nilluminating.\nThere are several limitations to this study, which limit\nthe applicability of these findings. The exclusion of arti-\ncles in languages other than English did lead to the loss of\na number of articles. In the absence of translated copies,\nmonolingual occupational therapists will not have access\nto potentially valuable evidence (regardless of the lan-\nguage it is published in). Although it is important to pre-\nserve linguistic diversity within the profession, resources\nfor translation would be a good investment. With regard to\nthe publication process, only some of the journals publish\ninformation usually in the form of dates for submission,\nacceptance, or publication. This introduced some potential\ninaccuracy into the findings, but they are the most accurate\npossible in the circumstances and should be regarded as\nestimates.\nConclusion\nThe current evidence base for mental health occupational\ntherapy is substantial and diverse, having grown consider-\nably in the last decade. The vast majority of the evidence was\nwritten either by authors in academic roles or collaborative\nteams comprising academics and clinicians. The aforemen-\ntioned diversity was also evident in the fact the articles were\nfound in so many peer-reviewed journals.\nOur knowledge in some areas (such as autism and demen-\ntia) is relatively comprehensive, or rapidly developing. In\nothers, there is a distinct lack of evidence (such as personal-\nity disorders), and the reasons for these omissions are not\nclear. There was a gap in published evidence about mood and\nanxiety disorders, which are the mental health problems with\nthe highest prevalence. Accepting the inclusive perspective\nof this study has enabled a comprehensive understanding of\nwhat is available to mental health occupational therapists.\nThis article has documented the evidence based for the first\ndecade of this century in mental health occupational therapy\nthat was written in English.\nAppendix\nMethods Used to Construct Evidence for Mental Health\nOccupational Therapy.\nType of evidence Method\nNo. of\nstudies\nRandomized controlled trials 52\nSystematic review 25\nMeta-analysis 5\nConsensual qualitative 3\nFramework analysis 2\nMeta-synthesis 5\nInterpretative\ninteractionalism\nInstitutional textual analysis 1\nDeductive interpretative\napproach\nSociolinguistic analysis 1\nMixed methods Case studies 93\nParticipatory action research 9\nLiterature review 70\nProgram description 49\nReflection/personal\ntestimony\nCritical analysis 26\nPractice evaluation 19\nCritically appraised topic 12\nPractice guidelines 9\nPath analysis 3\nHistorical 3\nScoping review 2\nEvidence mapping 1\nNeeds assessment 1\nCritical incident technique 1\nLogic model 1\nCost effectiveness 1\nInterpretative biography 1\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAcharya, V.
