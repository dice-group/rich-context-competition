The social brain theory provides a plausible explanation for\nthis phenomenon. According to this hypothesis, the unusual brain size is due to the\nadaptation to a more complex social life (Barton and Dunbar, 1997; Byrne and Whiten,\n1988; Dunbar, 1998), however, the exact social skills that resulted in this have not been\nclarified yet. Many authors provide a reflection on the social brain theory at a behavioral\nSociable personality and human brain size\nShultz and Dunbar, 2007), but these studies concentrate on interspecies differences. Social\ncomplexity requires large cognitive capacity. To live in a stable social group and sustain\ngroup cohesion members have to coordinate their behavior with others (Dunbar and Shultz,\n2007b; Shultz and Dunbar, 2007), as well as to manage complex relational information\n(Dunbar, 1998). Individuals have to maintain more relationships and be able to respond\nappropriately to social interactions. Individuals have different goals and desires that might\nnot conflict with those of others (Barrett, Henzi, and Dunbar, 2003). The authors suggest\nthat \"the ability to reason causally, the ability to reason analogically, the ability to exert\ncognitive control to generate and assess alternative options, and the ability to formulate\nthese options into alternative sequences of future actions and to select between them\" (pp.\n496) are critical to develop high-level sociocognitive abilities.\nThe social brain theory is supported by plenty of quantitative research on primates\nand some other non-primate (carnivores and ungulates) mammals (Dunbar and Shultz,\n2007a). According to the review of Dunbar and Shultz (2007b), correlations were observed\nbetween relative brain size or neocortex size and variables that indicate social complexity.\nThese variables are: social group size (Dunbar, 1992), number of females in the group\n(Lindenfors, 2005), grooming clique size (Kudo and Dunbar, 2001), the frequency of\ncoalitions (Dunbar and Shultz, 2007a), male mating strategies (Pawlowski, Lowen and\nDunbar, 1998), the prevalence of social play (Lewis, 2001), the frequency of tactical\ndeception (Byrne and Corp, 2004), and the frequency of social learning (Reader and Laland,\n2002). Shultz and Dunbar (2007) have demonstrated that pairbonded species of vertebrates\nhave larger brains for body size than species with other types of mating system. Moreover,\nin primates the quantitative group size has a significant effect on brain size, but in other\ntaxa does not.\nFewer studies have been carried out on humans. Dunbar, McAdam and OConnell\n(2005) have shown that relative frontal lobe volume is associated with the speed with\nwhich individuals solve a puzzle box task comparing chimpanzees, orangutans and children.\nStiller and Dunbar (2007) studied the relationship between social network size and two\ncognitive processes. Perspective taking competence was related to the size of the\nindividual's support clique (the number of individuals in the innermost circle of friends),\nwhile the short time memory performance was associated to the sympathy group size,\nwhich is a larger network of 12-20 people who are contacted in every month. Powell and\ncolleagues (2010) found significant relationship between the orbital prefrontal cortex\nvolume and intentional competence. According to the reviews of Gallagher and Frith (2003)\nand Abu-Akel (2003), theory of mind can be connected to the anterior paracingulate cortex,\nthe anterior cingulate gyrus, the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex, the inferolateral\nfrontal cortex, the superior temporal sulcus, the temporal poles, and the amygdala too\nbesides the orbitofrontal cortex. Furthermore, Dunbar (2009) cites two highly relevant\nunpublished results. By using fMRI Birch, Lewis, Dunbar (unpublished, as cited in Dunbar\n2009) observed that tasks in which participants had to represent the mind states of other\nindividuals were cognitively more demanding. In other studies using voxel-based\nmorphometry, theory of mind correlated with the volumes of the frontal and the temporal\nlobes (Lewis et al., unpublished, as cited in Dunbar 2009).\nSociable personality and human brain size\nFurthermore, indirect information on the possible associations of brain size and\nsocial life among humans is provided by the studies examining neuroanatomical correlates\nof the levels of sociability-related personality dimensions. Extraversion is a trait with\npotential relevance expressing the individual differences in sociability and on which\nneuroanatomical investigations have carried out. In these studies, the Extraversion factor of\nNEO-PI-R (Revised Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Personality Inventory) or NEO-\nFFI (NEO-Five Factor Inventory, which is the short version of NEO-PI-R) was used. The\nself-report inventories were developed by Costa and McCrae (Costa, and McCrae, 1992;\nCosta, McCrae, and Dye, 1991) for measuring the factors of the Big Five. The Extraversion\ndimension has six subdomains: Warmth, Gregariousness, Assertiveness, Activity,\nExcitement Seeking, and Positive Emotion. Omura, Constable, and Canli (2005) employed\nthe method called voxel based morphometry which technique can objectively measure gray\nmatter volume and concentration. The authors reported positive correlations of the\nExtraversion factor of NEO-PI-R with the left amygdala and the bilateral orbitofrontal\ncortex, but negative correlations with the bilateral precentral gyrus. Other methods were\nused by Wright and colleagues (2006), who measured cortical thickness and the volume of\namygdala by manual tracing. No significant correlations between Extraversion (assessed by\nthe NEO-FFI) and the amygdala volume were observed. Moreover, in contrast with Omura,\nConstable, and Canli (2005) Wright and colleagues (2006) found significant negative\ncorrelations between Extraversion and the thickness of the right inferior prefrontal (BA 45)\nand the middle frontal cortices (BA 9), as well as of the right fusiform gyrus (BA 20). The\nauthors suggested that their results are consistent with two classical biological models of\npersonality (Eysencks and Grays) that claim that extraverts have lower cortical activity\nthan introverts. Extraverts have thinner cortex which may be associated with lower\nmetabolic activity. Knutson and colleagues (2001) examined the relationship between the\nratio of the brain to the remainder of the intracranial volume and the NEO-PI-R factors, but\ncorrelation with Extraversion was not observed. Because of using the NEO-PI-R or NEO-\nFFI, the Extraversion factor is more than pure sociability (Sociability is one of its facets),\nother facets are for example Activity, which is a separate trait in Zuckermans model,\nSensation Seeking which is a part of Impulsivity-Sensation Seeking trait in the same model,\nand there is an item related to Impulsivity. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the\napparent inconsistency is caused by the combination of separate personality factors.\nIn this study, we measured Sociability that is a personality dimension of the\nZuckermans Alternative Five Factor model (Zuckerman, 2002). The five factors are\nImpulsive Unsocialized Sensation Seeking, Aggression-Hostility, Activity, Sociability, and\nNeuroticism-Anxiety. Zuckerman emphasized that a basic personality trait should have\nbiological basis. Therefore, during the development of the Alternative Five model of\npersonality, researchers factor analyzed personality scales had been used in\npsychobiological studies previously (Zuckerman, Kuhlman, and Camac, 1988). In a debate\nabout the criteria of the basic personality factors in the early nineties, Zuckerman\nemphasized the importance of four standards. The main point of this debate was centered\naround the issue whether three or five factors could describe better the structure of\npersonality. The four criteria that Zuckerman assumed were: reliability of the dimensions\nacross ages, genders, cultures and methods; at least a moderate heritability; identification of\nSociable personality and human brain size\nsimilar kind of behavioral elements in non-human species; and association with a biological\ntrait marker (Zuckerman, 1992). In this way, the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality\nQuestionnaire (ZKPQ III-R) is based on studies connecting biological approach with\ntaxonomic studies (Zuckerman, Kuhlman, and Camac, 1988). Sociability includes the\nnumber of friends, the amount of time spent with them, outgoingness, the preference for\nsocial activities, and the intolerance for social isolation (Zuckerman, 2002). Therefore, we\nassume that a more sociable person has a more complex social life that requires more\ndeveloped social cognition and that provides the opportunity to build on high-level social\nskills.\nPersonality can be studied at many levels, from the genetic base to the measurement\nof personality traits through biochemical, neurological, psychophysiological determinants,\nbrain structure and social behavior (Zuckerman, 1995). The neural architecture provides the\nfinal common pathway through which culture, social factors, and genetics all operate\ntogether (Davidson, 2001). Improvement in neuroimaging (mainly magnetic resonance\nimaging) has made quantitative analysis of brain morphology more viable. However, the\nmajority of the studies focus on the relationships between brain structure and several\npsychopathologies (Matsui et al., 2000) rather than on the personality of healthy individuals.\nStudying inter-individual variability could provide valuable information about the neural\nbasis of human behavior and cognition (Kanai and Rees, 2011).\nAs far as we know, Zuckermans Alternative Five Personality traits, such as\nSociability, have not been examined yet in relation to structural brain measures. The few\nrelated studies used questionnaires (NEO-PI-R, NEO-FFI) assessing the Five Factor Model\nof Costa and McCrae (Knutson et al., 2001; Omura, Constable, and Canli, 2005; Wright et\nCloningers Temperament and Character Inventory (Kaasinen et al., 2005), and\nZuckermans Sensation Seeking Scale (Martin et al., 2007). Regarding Extraversion, results\nseem to be inconsistent as we mentioned it before.\nThe aim of this pilot study is to examine whether the individual differences in\nhuman brain volumes are connected with the Sociability personality dimension that is\nassociated with individuals' social lives including their social skills. This question is highly\nrelevant according to the framework of Evolutionary Cognitive Neuroscience (Krill et al.,\n2007). We intended to test in our study whether the social brain theory can be extended to\nthe field of individual differences. This theory is supported by plenty of research carried\nout on non-human species, and these studies use a whole cerebrum or neocortex approach.\nThis way, we hypothesize that the level of sociability is positively related to the volumes of\nthe cerebrum, the neocortex, the frontal and the temporal lobes.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwenty-five adults recruited by newspaper advertisement participated in this study.\nThe research protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of\nBehavioural Sciences, Semmelweis University, Budapest. There were seven women and 18\nmen in our sample. According to a semi-structured interview, participants did not report\nSociable personality and human brain size\nhistory of any chronic or current acute illness. Subjects were free of any current drug\neffects including contraceptives. All subjects were Caucasians and native Hungarian\nhanded men in the study. All subjects gave informed consent before participation in the\nstudy. Two of the participants did not give their height.\nMeasures\nPersonality Questionnaire. Personality was assessed by the Hungarian version of\nthe Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire form III (Zuckerman et al., 2002),\nwhich was developed to measure the dimensions of the Alternative Five. ZKPQ III-R is a\n99-item self-report questionnaire, where the subjects must decide if the statement is true or\nfalse according to their personalities. It consists of five scales (Impulsive Sensation\nSeeking, Aggression-Hostility, Activity, Sociability, and Neuroticism-Anxiety) and a social\ndesirability scale (Infrequency).\nThe Sociability scale contains 17 items regarding to the number of friends (\"I do not\nneed a large number of casual friends\"), the amount of time spent with them (\"I spend as\nmuch time with my friends as I can\"), how the person feels at parties (\"I often find myself\nbeing the life of the party\"), preference and tolerance for being alone (\"Generally, I like to\nbe alone so I can do things I want to do without social distractions\") etc.\nThe reliability of the Sociability scale is appropriate. The Cronbach  value\nrevealing internal consistency was .75 in the original American sample (Zuckerman et al.,\n1993), but similar values were obtained in Spanish (Aluja, Garc\u00eda, and Garc\u00eda, 2004),\nGerman (Ostendorf and Angleitner, 1994), Chinese (Wu et al., 2000), and Japanese\n(Shiomi et al., 1995) samples. In a Hungarian sample (251 subjects) the Cronbach  was\n.78 (R\u00f3zsa and Nagy, 1998). The validity of the scale according to the peer-self agreement\nis good. Angleitner, Riemann and Spinath (2004) had friends or relatives of the subjects\nfilling out the ZKPQ III-R but according to the subjects personalities. The self-observer\ncorrelation was significant. In the same study, the authors investigated monozygotic and\ndizygotic twin pairs revealing a heritability index of .51 regarding the Sociability scale.\nMRI measurements and morphometric analysis. The subjects were scanned with a\n1.5-T MRI device (Siemens Magnetom Symphony). During the analysis T1-weighted\n(differentiating fat from water), three Dimensional Magnetization Prepared Rapid\nAcquisition Gradient Echo (3D MP-RAGE) sequences with 1.5 mm slice thickness were\ncollected.\nVolumes of several brain structures (right and left frontal and temporal lobes,\ncerebrum, and neocortex) were computed with the HAMMER (Hierarchical Attribute\nMatching Mechanism for Elastic Registration; version 1G5J, Department of Radiology,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Health System, Shen and Davatzikos, 2003) software package.\nThis package uses the FSL (FMRIB Software Library; Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford,\nUK., v3.2, 2004) tools for skull stripping (BET = Brain Extractor Tool \u00ad segments brain\nfrom non-brain, and models skull and scalp surfaces) and brain tissue segmentation (FAST\n= FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool \u00ad brain segmentation into different tissue types\nand bias field correction). After removing the bone tissue, the remaining data are\nautomatically classified into three classes: gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal\nSociable personality and human brain size\nfluid. The automatic classification is based on the intensities as described in Goldszal and\nNext, the brain images are automatically registered and warped based on the\nconcept of attribute vectors and by using a hierarchical approximation of the similarity\nfunction. An attribute vector is a collection of geometric attributes whose goal is to\nuniquely characterize every single voxel in a brain image, thereby reducing ambiguity in\nthe matching process. Hierarchical approximation is used in order to significantly reduce\nlocal minima, which typically represent poor matches. The process is guided by those parts\nof the anatomy that can be identified more reliably than others. Good examples are the\nroots of sulci and the crowns of the gyri, which can be identified much more reliably than\nintermediate cortical points. The segmented volume was coregistered with Jacob atlas\nby Noor Kabani; last revision 2003) with an elastic transformation method, and different\nbrain structures are identified on individual studies. At last step, we visually verified the\nresults.\nWe measured the volumes of the cerebrum, the neocortex, the left and the right\nfrontal and temporal lobes. The cerebrum was defined as the white and grey matter of the\nbrain excluding the cerebellum, the brain stem, and the thalamus-hypothalamus, while the\nneocortex is the grey matter part of the cerebrum except basal ganglia, hippocampal\nformation, and the cingulate gyrus. The frontal lobe is the brain area between the central\nsulcus and the lateral sulcus, while the temporal lobe extends to the lateral sulcus superiorly\nand to the artificially lengthened parietooccipital sulcus posteriorly. The temporal lobe\nincludes the amygdala and the hippocampal formation\nStatistical analysis\nTo examine the relationship between the volumes of the frontal and temporal lobes,\nthe neocortex, as well as the cerebrum we computed partial correlation coefficients. To\nexclude the effects of the age and body size differences \u00ad including sex \u00ad we used a control\nfor age and body height (measured in cm). The fact that brain size decreases with age is\nwell-known (Dekaban and Sadowsky, 1978; Witelson, Beresh, and Kigar, 2006), while the\nrelationship between body height and brain size is more controversial (Spann and\nDustmann, 1965; Witelson, Beresh, and Kigar, 2006). We expected positive correlations\nbetween the above areas and the Sociability score. To control of the risk of Type I.\nstatistical error we applied the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (Benjamini and Hochberg,\nCorporation) using an implementation described by Thissen, Steinberg, and Kuang (2002).\nResults\nIn our sample the average brain volume (without the brain stem and the cerebellum)\n3.13). Males and females differed significantly in their brain size and in the volumes of\ntheir lobes (p < .01), as well as in the volume of the neocortex (p = .014). There were no\ngender differences in age. The correlations between the brain regions and height and age\nSociable personality and human brain size\nare shown in Table 1. All of our variables follow normal distribution according to the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test.\nTable 1. Correlations between brain areas and height and age\nHeight Age\nr p r p\nTable 2. Partial correlations between Sociability score and brain areas\nr p\nSignificant after\ncorrection\nSociability score correlated positively both with the whole and the regional brain\nvolumes if we controlled the effects of age and body height. In details, positive correlations\nwere observed between Sociability score and the right frontal lobe (r(23)\nthe left frontal lobe (r(23)\nthe left temporal lobe (r(23)\n= .674, p = .001). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation\nbetween Sociability score and the volume of the cerebrum (r(23)\n= .663, p = .001). According to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, the\nprobabilities for the correlations of the left and the right frontal lobe volumes with the\nSociability score have not reached the critical -value. However, the correlation\ncoefficients characterizing the covariations of the volumes of the temporal lobes, the\ncerebrum, and the neocortex with Sociability remained significant after the corrections for\nmultiple testing. The results are shown in Table 2. The partial correlations of Sociability\nwith the left and the right temporal lobes are plotted on Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.\nAge and height adjusted values (residuals) of the left and right temporal lobes and\nSociability score in the scatterplots were obtained via regression analyses. If we analyzed\nmales and females separately, significant correlations between ZKPQ III-R Sociability and\nbrain anatomy were observed in men only. Sociability correlated positively with the left\n= .634, p = .015). However, these correlations were not significant after the\nSociable personality and human brain size\nBenjamini-Hochberg correction. No significant correlations between Sociability and brain\nvolumes were found in women (Table 3). Moreover, no ZKPQ III-R scales other than\nSociability correlated significantly with the volumes of the above brain structures.\nFigure 1.

Partial correlations between Sociability score and brain areas by sex\nMales Females\nr p r p\nDiscussion\nIn our preliminary study we examined the relationship between Sociability\npersonality dimension and the volumes of the frontal, the temporal lobes, as well as the\nwhole cerebrum and the neocortex. Our results supported our hypothesis that the level of\nSociability is positively related to the volumes of these areas. The most remarkable\ncorrelations were found with the temporal lobes and the neocortex. These correlations were\nsignificant only in men if we analyzed females and males separately. No significant\ncorrelations were observed regarding women. Because there were only seven women who\nparticipated in this study, our result are more valid for men. These findings may have two\nmajor implications, one for evolutionary psychology and one for personality psychology;\nhowever, these suggestions have to be treated cautiously as a consequence of the small\nsample size.\nOur results suggest that the \"social brain theory\" (Barton and Dunbar, 1997; Byrne\nand Whiten, 1988; Dunbar, 1998), which provides a possible explanation to the interspecies\ndifferences in brain size, can be extended to human interindividual differences.\nFurthermore, the theory is strongly supported by our observations, as brain size was related\nto a marker of social life among humans. However, it is not clear which factor of social life\nor social complexity causes this relationship, and our study cannot answer this question\neither, because the examined Sociability dimension is also a general concept. Many authors\nCole, 2007; Stiller and Dunbar, 2007) claim that sociocognitive abilities which are\nnecessary to live in a group are behind this relationship in animals. It is highly probable\nthat this is applicable to humans too; a person who is more sociable has to maintain more\nrelationships and they are better in these abilities. The findings of this study are consistent\nwith the unpublished results cited by Dunbar (2009), that the temporal and frontal lobes are\nassociated with theory of mind processes.\nThe above findings may suggest that the Sociability personality trait is\ncharacterized by more obvious neurological correlates than the Extraversion, and the\ninconsistent results of the studies focusing on the latter could be a consequence of this\naspect. The broader interpretation of Extraversion may be a possible explanation for this\nfact (Zuckerman, 1991). The narrowest sense of Extraversion is Sociability. The broad\nExtraversion concept contains subtraits such as activity, sensation seeking, positive\nSociable personality and human brain size\nemotion, warmth, assertiveness. Zuckerman (1991) suggests that \"the psychobiological\ncorrelates may be limited to one or another of the subtraits and not to the others\" (pp. 122).\nThe stronger correlations of Sociability with brain areas may underpin this idea; however,\nfurther research is needed to confirm our findings in other samples with a larger number of\ncases. The results also implicate that Sociability satisfy better the criteria of basic\npersonality factors due to its association with a biological trait marker (Zuckerman, 1992).\nIn this study, we used a whole lobe or brain approach instead of a more specified\nanalysis. First of all, our aim was to test whether the social brain theory is applicable to\nhuman individual differences. The studies supporting this theory followed a whole brain or\nneocortex approach. Secondly, regarding humans, theory of mind was shown to be\nconnected with around nine different brain areas in the frontal and temporal lobes.\nMoreover, inconsistent results of the studies examining the relationship between\nExtraversion and brain structures hinder any intentions aiming to formulate specific\nhypotheses regarding localized brain regions. Furthermore, the examination of specific\nstructures would increase the number of variables and thus the risk of the Type I statistical\nerror.\nRegarding the limitations of our study, we should note that the sample size was not\nlarge enough to draw definite conclusions, and this is especially true for the analysis\nregarding females. Furthermore, the results do not explain the underlying mechanisms of\nsocial cognition. Dunbar (2009) suggests that the combination of neurobiological and\ncomparative approaches may provide a clarification. Moreover, we do not know due to the\nlimitations of a correlation study if larger brains cause higher Sociability or higher\nSociability causes larger brains. It is also possible that a third variable is behind these\ncorrelations. Furthermore, studies using questionnaires could have some inherent\nlimitations too. The questionnaires cannot measure the psychological variables directly, and\nrespondents may answer the questions superficially or they may intend to satisfy social\ndesirability. Behavioral observations would be ideal to confirm our findings.\nTo summarize we would like to emphasize that only tentative conclusions can be\ndrawn from these results. Indeed, these findings have considerable implications for two\nmajor fields of psychology.\n"
