As recently as the year 1995,\nthe adult obesity rate in every state in the United States was well\nbelow the 20% level, and in some cases under the 15% level. In\n2007, however, all but one US state witnessed its adult obesity\nrate exceed the 20% level. In the same year, the Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention estimated that 36.7% of the US pop-\nulation was \"overweight\" and 26.3% could be categorized as\nThese increased levels of obesity constitute a major health\nand economic problem for the United States. Physical health\nrisks faced by obese individuals include but are not limited\nto osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some\nforms of cancer, and an overall increased probability of mor-\ntality. In addition to physical heath problems related to obesity,\nthere are also major psychological and social implications of\nthis disease. Obese individuals may suffer from having fewer\nfriendships, they may be considered less attractive, or they may\notherwise be subject to societal prejudice or social stigma (3).\nThe economic costs commonly associated with obesity include\nthe health-care costs of prevention and the treatment of \nobesity\nand comorbid conditions.\nResearch in this area has focused on determining what char-\nacteristics of individuals, families, and communities are related\nto increased levels of obesity with the ultimate goal being to\nemploy these characteristics to decrease average levels of obes-\nity (4\u00ad11). The current analysis focuses on an individual char-\nacteristic related to nutritional content. Specifically, this work\nanalyzes the relationship between iron deficiency and average\nlevels of obesity in the adult population of females.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) considers iron defi-\nciency to be one of the most prevalent nutritional disorders in\nthe world. They estimate that >30% of the world population is\niron deficient. In North America, a total of 7.1 million women\n(pregnant and nonpregnant) and preschool aged children are\nmost commonly develops when an individual does not ingest a\nsufficient amount of iron to meet average dietary needs. It may\nalso occur, however, in the case of iron-absorption problems or\nheavy loss of blood, where an individual is ingesting the appro-\npriate amount of iron but will still develop iron deficiency. For\nexample, an individual could lose blood due to frequent blood\ndonations, heavy menstruation, or certain stomach and intes-\ntinal conditions such as food sensitivity. In fact, a joint report\nby the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nstatesthat\"deficienciesofothernutrientssuchasvitaminAmay\nalso cause a functional iron deficiency even when iron stores\nare adequate\" (see WHO site for micronutrients http://www.\nwho.int/nutrition/topics/ida/en/). Females are considered at\nhigher risk of iron deficiency than males. This increased prob-\nability of iron deficiency holds when comparing comparable\naged men and women in each age category. Women lose blood\nin relation to menstruation and other life stages; resulting in a\ndepletion of the iron content in their bodies. It is partially for\nthis reason that we chose to focus specifically on women in the\ncurrent analysis.\nWe hypothesize that iron deficiency is related to an individ-\nual's BMI and proceed to examine this possibility empirically.\nIron and Obesity in Females in the United States\nFlorence Neymotin1 and Urmimala Sen2\nSince the late 1980s, the United States has witnessed a dramatic increase in average BMI levels and the proportion\nof individuals categorized as obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for a variety of illnesses, and an increase in obesity\nis, therefore, implicated in increased health-care costs in the United States. These ultimately translate to a major\nhealth and economic problem for the United States. The present analysis examines a pathway to increased levels\nof obesity as of yet almost entirely unexplored. Specifically, we examine the relationship between obesity and iron\ndeficiency via analyses of blood samples. The current analysis employs public-use data files from the continuous\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999\u00ad2006) survey to determine the relationship between\nobesity and an individual's iron blood content. Results suggest a negative relationship between levels of iron blood\ncontent and individual BMI after controlling for other individual characteristics. These results hold for nearly all eight\npanels tested in the ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions.\n1Department of Economics, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA; 2Department of Economics, Georgia State University, Andrew Young School\nof Policy Studies, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

We employ Continuous National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) public-use panel\nsis. This paper is unique in demonstrating that there is indeed\na relationship between blood iron and obesity for the adult\nfemale population in the United States.\nThe remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: Methods\nand Procedures section describes the data and empirical meth-\nods and procedures employed in the analysis. Results section\npresents summary statistics and results. Discussion section\npresents conclusions and a discussion of directions for future\nresearch.\nMethods and Procedures\nThe NHANES is a program of studies conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics to assess the health and nutritional status\nof adults and children in the United States. We employ the public-use\nsampling procedure: The Primary Sampling Units are first selected. The\nPrimary Sampling Units are generally single counties although small\ncounties are sometimes combined to meet minimum population size\nrequirements. The Primary Sampling Units are next segmented and\nhouseholds within each segment are chosen by a process of random\nselection. Finally, individuals within each household are sampled ran-\ndomly from within the households. Oversampling within geographic\nareas is employed for the following groups: low income, racial minori-\nties, children, and the elderly. The survey combines both interviews and\nphysical examinations. BMI is assessed through the use of a physical\nexamination rather than (possibly flawed) individual reports of height\nand weight. Information on iron content is elicited through blood sam-\nuals aged 1 year and older. However, the sampling method has been\ntests are performed on 3- to 5-year-old adolescents and females aged\n12\u00ad59 years. These individuals in particular are sampled due to their\nincreased risk of iron deficiency. Demographic information is elic-\nited through interview responses of individuals. As mentioned previ-\nously, only female responses are employed in the current analysis. Data\nrestrictiveness was a factor in deciding to focus on women in this study.\nDuring several of the relevant years of the NHANES only samples of\nfemales were maintained.\nWe run three ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with BMI as the\ndependent variable and Iron as the explanatory variable of interest. The\ninitial specification is augmented in the second and third specifications,\nwhich allow for interactions between age and iron and between race and\niron, respectively, to determine whether the relationship between iron\nand BMI is differentially impacted by either individual race or age. We\nchose to focus on race and age in particular due to the current interest in\nracially driven patterns of obesity as well as patterns differentially impact-\ning children vs. adults (13). We also employ standard additional con-\ntrol characteristics to capture the notions of socioeconomic status--via\nincome and education, the biggest factors in constructing socioeconomic\nstatus measures--and nativity: both considered key factors in affecting\nobesity rates.\nIn particular, we believe that if our analysis ignored either education\nor income (our socioeconomic status markers), then our estimate of the\nrelationship between iron and BMI would be biased as both are affected\nby education, and similarly for income. Higher BMI individuals tend to\nhave lower income (particularly for women) although this gap in income\nhas recently been shrinking, and iron deficiency is often cited as a causal\nfactor in lowering individual (and eventually national) levels of income\nand productivity (14\u00ad16). Therefore, an estimated bias would occur by\nleaving out the income variable from our analysis. Similarly, we know that\nobesity is related to lower levels of educational attainment, and anemia is\nrelated to lower enrollment rates in schooling (17\u00ad19). Taken together,\nleaving out a control variable for education would bias our estimate of the\nrelationship between BMI and iron deficiency, as it would be picking up\nthese variable's additional relationships with educational attainment.\nThe baseline OLS regression employed for our analysis is given by\nEquation (1).\nBMI Iron Age Education Income\nRace\n= + + + +\n+ +\n    \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\nMarital Status Country\n+ +\n u\n\nIron is measured in micrograms per deciliter (g/dl) of blood.

The\nvariables Race, Marital Status, and Country are eponymous dummies;\nRace includes dummies for Mexican, Other Hispanic, Black, and Other\nRaces (implying races other than the four mentioned, which includes\nmultiracial individuals). The Marital Status dummies include variables\nfor individuals who are Married, Widowed, Divorced, Separated, and\nNever Married. We also control for whether the individual was born\nin United States/Mexico/other country via the Country dummy. The\nvariable u is the error term.\nWe next focus on the relationship between age, iron content, and BMI.\nWe would like to determine whether iron has a differential impact on\nBMI by age. Our regression for analysis is given by Equation (2).\nBMI Iron Age Education Income\nRace\n= + + + +\n+ +\n    \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\nMarital Status Country\nAge Age-Iron\n+\n+ + +\n\n  u\n\nWe add an interaction term between age and iron (Age-Iron) as well\nas a square of the age variable (Age2) to allow for a nonlinear rela-\ntionship between age and BMI. All other variables are defined as in\nEquation (1).\nTo examine whether there is a differential impact on BMI of iron con-\ntent by race, we introduce interactions between race and the level of iron\nand we have Equation (3).\nBMI Iron Age Education Income\nRace\n= + + + +\n+ +\n    \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\nMarital Status Country\nAge Race-Iron\n+\n+ + +\n\n  u\n\nWe have replaced the age\u00adiron interaction term with race\u00adiron inter-\naction terms (respectively Mexican\u00adIron, Other Hispanic\u00adIron,\nBlack\u00adIron, and Other Races\u00adIron). All other variables are defined as\nin specification 2.\nAs we conclude our description of methods, we would like to point\nout the NHANES data, which permit us to measure iron currently con-\ntained in the blood but not iron intake. For this reason, our analysis\nwill not allow us to distinguish between iron deficiencies that are due to\na problem with absorption and those that arise due to a problem with\nintake--such as a nutritional deficiency. Ideally, we would have a measure\nof iron intake as well as iron deficiency that would allow us to distinguish\nbetween these two different routes; however, this is not feasible in the\ndata in question.\nResults\nTable 1 displays means and standard deviations of key vari-\nables in the analysis while stratifying on year of interest.\nStatistics are further distinguished by whether the full sample\nor the controlled sample is employed, where the controlled\narticles\n \nsample is the group of individuals actually used in the regres-\nsion analysis from each panel and the full sample includes\nall women surveyed in the panel. Each of the variables: Age\n(in years), Education and Annual Current Population Survey\nFamily Income display similar means in both the full and the\ncontrolled sample. BMI's mean value differs between the full\nand the controlled sample due to the varying gender compo-\nsition between the full and controlled samples. In NHANES\nried out on all eligible individuals aged 1 year and above, the\ncount for the BMI and Iron variables include both the male\nand female population.

It should be noted that although these years\ninclude a \"count\" for the full population, the statistical analysis\nof effects of the relationship of BMI to iron levels is restricted\nto only the female population for all years in question. Average\nBMI always exceeds a value of 27 in each cohort, which cor-\nresponds to the range \"overweight\" as per Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention definitions. The mean of the Iron vari-\nable differs in the initial two cohorts as the full sample includes\nboth the male and female population. The standard deviations\nmeasures for included variables are similar in the full and\ncontrolled samples. These results imply some degree of selec-\ntion into our controlled sample, but we think they should be\ngenerally representative of the larger underlying population.\nThe regression results for empirical Equations (1)\u00ad(3) are\ndisplayed in Tables 2\u00ad4, respectively.

Interestingly, the variable Age (in years) is significant in\nall cohorts. This result stands in contrast with the Israeli study\namong children aged 3\u00ad19 years, where age and gender did not\nhave an effect on BMI (21).\nTable 3 shows the level of iron is statistically significant in\nrelation to BMI after adding age interactions in all four cohorts\nof the data. The robust t-statistics for the Iron variable range\nwhen we add the age\u00adiron interaction term. After adding addi-\ntional terms, however, iron once again becomes significant. The\ninteraction between age and iron is not itself significant until\nBMI and iron levels is not different based on age group for the\nearlier years of the data but it does differ by age for later years.\nThe regression results from Table 4 show that Iron and Age\n(in years) are significant in all cohorts and regressions. It is sur-\nprising that, barring some isolated cases, none of the race\u00adiron\ninteraction terms are significant, implying that there is no dif-\nferential relationship between iron and BMI by race.\nWe measure BMI elasticities for the iron\u00adBMI relationship\nacross the panel of 8 years. The elasticities in Supplementary\nTable S1 online are calculated using sample means and the\ncoefficients from all three rounds of the regression analysis. An\nelasticity is a type of sensitivity analysis commonly employed in\nsome of the social sciences. Specifically, we examine how a 1%\nincrease in iron deficiency affects BMI rates percentage-wise.\nThe figures from Supplementary Table S1 online indicate that\nover the panel of 8 years, as iron deficiency increases by 1%,\naverage BMI will correspondingly increase by ~0.10% on aver-\nage. This value dips in some cases, but remains fairly constant\nbetween 0.11 and 0.14%. However, it would be prudent to point\nout that perhaps iron is just one of the causal factors; several\nmore such as changes in the environment, an increase in con-\nsumption of fast food, sedentary lifestyles with several hours of\ntelevision viewing, and less hours of exercise, etc. have already\nbeen documented. One widely cited reason for this increase in\nobesity in the United States is unhealthy food habits of all indi-\nviduals. It is logical to conclude that if an individual is eating\nless of iron-rich foods such as beans, dried fruits, eggs, cereals,\nbread, or pasta that are fortified with iron, vegetables such as\nspinach, and more of high-calorie fast foods, that would natu-\nrally lead to low level of iron as well as a high level of obesity. It\nis also probable that there have been certain genetic changes in\nthe population, and one of these changes that adversely affect\nthe BMI of an individual is the drop in iron levels. It is also\nworth noting that deficiency of iron affects individual working\ncapacity (22). Individuals with low levels of iron would, there-\nfore, tend to become more sedentary and exercise less. This\nwould lead to an increase in the tendency to gain weight.\nWe compare our results with comparable elasticity measures\nreported by Rashad et al. (23)--standards in this literature--\nwhen examining the effect of a 1% increase of per capita res-\ntaurants on BMI rates (unfortunately, nothing comparable to\nthe iron relationship is yet available because the literature is so\nnew on this topic). They find that average adult BMI increases\nby 0.09% with an increase in per capita number of restaurants\nof 1% (23). We find a similar relationship. However, in the\n Non-Hispanic Black \u00d7\n Iron level\n Mexican American \u00d7\n Iron level\n Other Hispanic \u00d7\n Iron level\nAbsolute value of t-statistics in brackets. Here, we add interaction terms of iron and race. We keep the age2 term and remove the age\u00adiron interaction term. The controls\ninclude race (Mexican Americans, Other Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Blacks, and Other Races--including multiracial), marital status (Married, Widowed, Divorced, Sepa-\nrated, Never Married), and country of birth (United States, Mexico).\naSignificant at 1%; bSignificant at 5%.\nCPS, Current Population Survey; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nTable 4 (Continued)\narticles\n \npresent analysis, we are considering a slightly different factor\nof interest, namely iron content. We are unsurprised that the\npercentage change in BMI is slightly higher as a result of an\niron deficiency because there presumably exists a multifaceted\nrelationship between iron deficiency and BMI, as compared to\nan external impact of the increase in the number of restaurants\nin one's neighborhood.\nBecause we do not have a definitive measure of whether the\niron-deficient individuals studied were suffering from a lack\nof iron intake or a defect of absorption, or some combination\nthereof, it is useful to discuss possible routes for the relation-\nship we have found for these scenarios. Straightforward intui-\ntion posits that low iron levels due to insufficient intake can be\na signal of a generally nutrient-poor (and thus calorie dense)\ndiet, which in turn will be correlated with higher rates of obes-\nity. This is the more likely cause, as our data set represents the\nresult of a random sampling scheme, and is fairly consistent\nacross ages and racial backgrounds. We believe that if the cor-\nrelation was due to reduced iron absorption, this heretofore\nunrecognized defect would need to be widespread enough to\nbe present for all racial groups and ages to be the main effect\nwe are seeing in the data. For this reason, we doubt that this is\nthe primary cause, although we cannot definitively rule it out.\nWe should also note another potential route of inter-\nest between anemia and BMI could be that iron deficiency\n(regardless of whether it is an issue of intake or of absorption)\nis likely to make individuals feel sluggish, and the resultant\nlack of exercise may lead to increased BMI.\nOne other route documented in the literature, which we\nbelieve to be a minor issue in our analysis, is the relationship\nbetween post-gastric-bypass and initial morbid obesity--as we\nbelieve few individuals in our data will have encountered this\ntype of surgery, and the obesity and anemia do not generally\noccur concurrently (24).\nA final route, also minor but meriting mention, is the rela-\ntionship between low pregestational iron stores in the form\nof ferritin and anemia at some point during pregnancy (25).\nThese pregnant women would show up as obese in the data\nlater in their term. Although this relationship between obesity\nvia pregnancy and anemia via reduced pregestational ferritin\nlevels has been documented, once again because our results are\nprevalent at all ages, we do not believe that this is the main fac-\ntor driving our results.\nDiscussion\nRising rates of obesity are widely recognized as a major pub-\nlic health concern. To combat this rise in obesity, we require\nthorough knowledge of the actual cause of the disease and\nhow it works, as well as how it becomes such an epidemic.\nThe Surgeon General's call to action to prevent and decrease\noverweight and obesity is the correct step in this direction.\nHowever, much more work is required before it may be truly\nclaimed that obesity has been successfully tackled.\nWe have established that the level of obesity among the\nfemale population (12 years and above) in the United States\nis correlated with iron levels after accounting for a variety\nof other demographic characteristics. The results of the OLS\nregressions indicate that iron is highly significant in relation to\nindividual BMI. This is true in the baseline specification as well\nas in the alternative specifications. Specifically, there appears to\nbe a negative relationship between iron levels and the level of\nindividual BMI. There is no evidence of a differential impact of\niron by race and little evidence of a differential impact of iron\nby age (especially for the earlier years of the dataset).\nOne point worth noting, however, is that the exact process by\nwhich iron levels affect an individual's BMI is still medically in\nquestion. Most medical studies have used cross-sectional data\nand have concluded that there is indeed a negative relationship\nbetween BMI and iron levels. Our study uses a much larger sam-\nple in terms of number of observations and time span, controls\nfor a larger number of demographic characteristics and still finds\nthe same negative relationship, lending support to these medical\nstudies with a more reliable data set and analysis.\nThe current analysis has clearly established a correlational,\nalthough not a definitively causal, relationship between iron\ndeficiency and BMI. A causal relationship would indicate the\nunambiguous benefit of iron supplementation in the popula-\ntion of individuals likely to develop anemia. Nevertheless, it is\npossible given the results of the current analysis that identifica-\ntion of individuals with low iron levels will serve as method of\ntargeting those at risk of developing obesity.\nSupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at\nhttp://www.nature.com/oby\n"
