The present study attempts\nto decipher the indications on the factors that could possibly influence purchase pref-\nerences of rural traditional retailers through the use of statistical methods of content\nanalysis. The purpose of the study is to identify the factors that influence purchase\npreference, analyse the temporal movement of conceptualizations of these factors, and\ndetermine whether academic thought on this topic has a conceptual core.\nThis research work presents a longitudinal analysis of the factors over a period of\n40 years: the need for information and training on new products and their selling\ntechniques seem to maintain the same significance throughout the study period; the\nneed for discounts has maintained almost a uniform ranking over the period of study;\nthere is also a relative stability in the need for regular/frequent service; doorstep\ndelivery had the highest ranking in the first period, which is probably owing to the\nrelative weakness of delivery systems during the early phase of rural marketing; the\nrequirement for credit seems to increase from the first period to the second period and\nthen decrease. The factor of margins and commissions seems highly ranked only in\nthe second period.\nDimension reduction technique and frequency tabulations are the methods used\nfor content analysis. The core concepts indicate that a traditional rural retailer can\npossibly be persuaded to purchase high-demand products and brands, through the\nprovision of credit, discounts, quantity discount schemes, margins and commis-\nsions, by using local distributors and by appointment of local company staff to\nprovide regular service. The analysis has yielded two discernible conceptual clusters:\nhigh-demand products and brands and credit; and doorstep delivery and regular\nservice. The clusters that emerge during the content analysis of traditional rural\nretailers' purchase preference factors reflect the exact content from conclusions in at\nleast one research paper that is not used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the\ncontent-analysis process. The result confirms that researchers have been moving on\nsimilar lines in their conceptualizations of the purchase preference factors of tradi-\ntional rural retailers.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nTheory on purchase behaviour owes its origin to\ntheStPetersburgparadoxpresentedbyNicholas\nBernoulli in the year 1713 (recounted by Stigler,\n1950). Since then, the field of consumer buying behav-\niour has expanded enough to warrant dedicated\nreview papers on the past literature (e.g., MacInnis &\nFolkes, 2010). A buyer behaviour model can help the\nmarketer to analyse available information about the\nmarket, identify the need for additional information,\nspecify targets for marketing effort, and identify the\nkinds of information needed by various purchasing\ndecision-makers and the criteria that they will use to\nmake these decisions (adapted from Webster & Wind,\n1972). Buyer behaviour studies may be divided into\ntwo broad classes corresponding to consumer markets\nand organizational markets (Wilson, 2000). A review of\nextant literature on organizational buyer behaviour has\nshown the presence of six distinct megatrends: Internet\nrevolution, inorganic growth through mergers and\nacquisitions, break-up of vertical integration, privat-\nization of public sector industries, rise of emerging\neconomies such as China and India, and globalization\nof markets (Sheth, 2006). The theoretical foundations of\norganizational purchase behaviour studies have been\nextended to organized retailers--it has been suggested\nthat retailers behave both like organizations and\nindividual consumers (Sheth, 1981). The study on\nsmall retailers' buyer behaviour (e.g., Runyan & Droge,\n2008) has emerged as an important subset of behav-\nioural research in the developed world. While small\ntraditional retailers in the developed world have been\nstruggling for survival against larger organized retail\nstores in both urban (Carter, Williams, & Reynolds,\nSwaffin-Smith, 2004), running small shops (traditional\nretail) is one of the highest return, non-agricultural\noccupations in the rural areas of the developing\ncountries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa (Reardon\nThe importance of rural traditional retailers, in the\ncontext of developing world, has been noted since their\nrecommendations have a significant bearing on the\ninitial trial and on the continued usage of a brand or\nized stores would probably never enjoy the relation-\nship and the recommendation power of a traditional\nrural retailer (Bhandari, 2014; Siddique & Siddique,\nKesari & Srivastava, 2012) recommend that marketers\nshould study the factors that lead to a greater purchase\npreference among rural retailers since they determine\nthe success of a rural marketer.\nThe purpose of this work is to present an integrative\nanalysis of the evidence on the purchase preference\nfactors of rural traditional retailers in developing coun-\ntries using published articles on rural marketing, rural\nretailers, and related topics. In an attempt to synthesize\nthe empirical evidence, statistical techniques are used,\nsince these purchase preference factors are mostly mani-\nfested in peripheral inferences of the studies identified.\nThe present study aims at providing valuable infor-\nmation to rural marketers about the areas that need\nattention in order to tap into rural markets using rural\nretailers. Furthermore, it seeks to develop an analytical\nframework of factors influencing purchase preference\nof rural tradition retailers along with a ranking of the\nimportance of each factor.\n`A retailer is more like a consumer in what he buys, and\nmore like an organizational buyer in how he buys his\nmerchandise'; therefore, a retailer's buying behaviour\nalizations of organized retailers supports the view that\na retailer balances rational and personal reasons while\nmaking purchase decisions (an exhaustive review\nhas been presented by Hansen & Skytte, 1998). While\norganizational buying may be a long-winding process\ninvolving multiple stakeholders (Chakravarti, 1989;\nMehta et al., 1981), small retailers often make faster\ndecisions (Pradhan, 2010). Interestingly, Runyan\nresearch papers on retailers' purchase behaviour,\nsuggested that researchers tend to focus more on large\norganized retailers than on small retailers.\nTraditional Retailer Buyer Behaviour Studies in\nMature Markets\nResearch on traditional retailers in the developed world\nis focused on their basic survival and the challenges\npertaining to their survival (Carter et al., 1997). Studies\nconducted in the Western developed world also delve\ninto strategies being adopted by traditional retailers to\nfight large organized retailers (Shaw & Gibbs, 1999). The\nspatial competitiveness of chains has proved disruptive\nto independent stores in rural areas of the developed\nworld (Alexander, Benson, & Shaw, 1999). Davies and\nItoh (2001) investigate the effects of legislature on the\ndecreasing number of small retail outlets. The situa-\ntion, in terms of decreasing numbers of rural retailers,\nis even worse in rural areas (Hildebrandt, 1987).\nTraditional Retailer Buyer Behaviour Studies in\nRural Areas of Developed World\nSmall retail shops in smaller towns and rural areas have\nbeen exposed to an increasing competition from large\nshopping centres and supermarkets in larger cities\n(Guy, 1990). The unfaithfulness towards local stores in\nrural areas, owing to availability of better range and\nlower prices at large organized retailers, has resulted in\nan increasing erosion of smaller rural shops (Crank et\nopment is also evident in rural markets of Sweden,\nwhere this disloyalty has been caused by changes that\ninclude increased car owning, resulting in increased\nmobility and out-shopping in urban centres (Forsberg,\n1998). Researchers from the Western world have shown\nthat when the local population falls below a particular\nthreshold, marginal revenue from rural retail activities\nfalls below a threshold value, leading to shop closures\nAdditionally, it has been shown that the arrival of\nlarge retailers in towns relatively closer to small towns\nand rural communities often accelerate the demise of\nretailers in these communities in developed countries\nIn contrast to the above observations for rural tradi-\ntional retailing in economically developed countries,\nrunning small shops (traditional retail) is one of the\nhighest return, non-agricultural occupations in rural\nareas of developing countries in Latin America, Asia,\nTraditional Retailer Buyer Behaviour Studies in\nRural Areas of Developing Countries\nAlthough rural retail consists of firms, limited in size\nand often located in remote places, they are the corner-\nstones of the local economy (Tolbert, Lyson, & Irwin,\n1998). Sociological studies in the rural areas of Latin\nAmerica indicate that the `nucleus' of rural community\ninvariably consists of `one or two tiny shops' (Wolfe,\n1966). A similar study in the Chinese context found\nthat consumers are not used to travelling from their\nhomes to big branded stores or malls (Elg, Ghauri, &\nTarnovskaya, 2008).Astudy conducted in LatinAmerica\nsuggested that traditional rural shopkeepers, with their\nlimited shelf space, are in stronger positions than organ-\nized retailers when they negotiate with suppliers (D\u00edaz,\nLacayo, & Salcedo, 2007). This view for rural parts of\nLatin America seems to be in contrast with the reality\nin developed countries where traditional retailers are\nbeing forced to shut down owing to the advent of large\norganized retailers (Hildebrandt, 1987).\nDespite being fragmented, rural retailers have consid-\nerable influence, since shop layouts do not allow\nconsumers to browse (Dawar & Chattopadhyay, 2000).\nSiddique and Siddique (2012) observed that many MNC\nfootwear giants started with exclusive stores and later\nrealized that they did not enjoy much brand equity in\nrural markets, and to capture the market share in rural\nIndia, they had to go to the local shoe sellers. It has also\nbeen suggested that rural retailer plays a unique role as\nadvisor, family friend, and micro creditor (Preeti, 2011).\nJohn and Mishra (2012) suggested that a rural retail-\ner's relation with consumers was based on an under-\nstanding of their needs and buying habits, and was\ncemented by the retailer's extension of credit. Neuwirth\n(2012) had noted that due to their proximity in the local\ncommunity, consumers and rural retail shop owners\noften formed close relationships, further cementing the\npower of the retailer in product recommendation. In\nIndia, data on rural consumer buying behaviour indi-\ncate that the rural retailer influences 35 per cent of the\npurchase occasions (Kesari & Srivastava, 2012; Khaled,\n2010). The recommendations of the rural retailer have a\nsignificant bearing on the initial trial rate and usage of\na brand (Aneja, 1993). This is important as the number\nof items stocked by the rural retail store is lower than\nthe urban retail store--on the average, the number of\nproduct categories stocked by a rural store is 19, while\nshopkeeper's recommendation is a significant factor\nin purchase decisions of rural consumers in India (Dey,\nand Schoormans (2013) suggested that considering\nthe endogenous and exogenous factors that influenced\nretailers' purchase decisions would make product\nintroduction decisions successful.\nIt appears that marketers in developing countries\ncannot borrow from the models of the developed\nworld, since the available literature on rural retailers\nin the developed world is related to the concepts\nof central market place theory (study of the impor-\ntance and influence of geographical location of rural\nout-shopping behaviour of rural consumers (rural\nconsumers shopping at nearby market towns or\nat larger discount stores, e.g., Kim & Stoel, 2010;\nSullivan & Savitt, 1997), or the phenomenon of\ndeclining number of traditional rural retailers (e.g.,\nthe review indicates the importance of developing\nspecific concepts on traditional retailers located\nin developing nations. Hence, researchers (e.g.,\nmend that marketers should study the purchase behav-\niour of rural retailers in the context of developing\ncountries, since the `motivation and attitude' of retailers\nthe success of rural marketing efforts. Indeed, `rural\nmarketing' has emerged as an important area of study\nin the developing world, owing to the recent `boom in\nconsumption' in rural markets (Kashyap, 2012) and\nalso because rural traditional retailers are the conduits\nfor accessing these markets (Balakrishnan, 1978).\n \n`Rural marketing' seemingly originated as a sepa-\nrate subject in a seminal paper by Skinner (1964) that\nanalysed rural marketing in China. Beginning in\nmarketing as a subject has evolved to include marketing\ndevelopmental marketing (e.g., Pankaj, 2005; Rao &\n(Jha, 2012). The evolution of rural marketing from\nagricultural marketing, with commodity and institu-\ntional focus, to a more comprehensive three-dimensional\nperspective of rural to urban, urban to rural, and rural\nto rural focus, in terms of flow of goods, services, and\nideas, to a developmental perspective with focus on the\npoor and vulnerable, is presented by Modi (2009) and\nby Jha (2012). Since rural traditional retailers are\nimportant for rural marketers, it is important to under-\nstand what factors affect purchase preference among this\nclass of retailers.\nTo identify the factors from literature, we develop\ncertain propositions that can be used to categorize\nthemes on traditional rural retailers. These proposi-\ntions are meant to help in categorization of relevant\ncontent from the available literature (as is the accepted\nmethodology in content-analytic studies, e.g., Verbeke,\nTransactions between rural retailers and marketers\noften begin with the actual delivery of products and\nservices--if the product can be delivered to the outlets,\nit would not only save transportation cost and travel\ntime to feeder towns, but also ensure that the retailer\nwould prefer to stock door-delivered products (Baig,\ngovernments should subsidize the delivery of consumer\ngoods to rural retailers by providing transportation\nsubsidies or tax concessions to rural marketers. Studies\nin the context of developing nations in Africa (e.g.,\nOlamigoke & Emmanuel, 2013) highlight the value\nof doorstep delivery of goods and even the value of a\ngood road transportation network for rural economy.\nThus, the proposition that follows is:\nP\n: Doorstep delivery positively influences purchase pref-\nerence of rural traditional retailers.\nHowever, doorstep delivery itself may not help if it is\nnot combined with the regularity or frequency needed\nto promote a brand and also if retailers are not assured\nof continuous supplies (Balakrishnan, 1978). Marketers\nshould appoint wholesalers to service smaller villages,\nwherever direct delivery appears to be an uneconom-\nical proposition (Narsimham, 1995). Regular service\nappears to be a requirement that is different from door-\nstep delivery, since doorstep delivery may not imply\nregular delivery. The consequent proposition, there-\nfore, is:\nP\n: Regular/frequent service is an influencing factor that\nis different from doorstep delivery, and this factor also\npositively influences purchase preference of rural tradi-\ntional retailers.\nAppointment of distributors in villages and nearby\ntowns would be advisable so that rural outlets can be\nmanaged in such a way that goods are made conven-\niently available to consumers (Verma, 1980). Research\nshows that rural retailers prefer delivery and service by\nlocal distributors or wholesalers over national distribu-\ntion houses or distributors operating from urban centres\n(Olamigoke & Emmanuel, 2013). It has been suggested\nthat distributors should be appointed in feeder towns to\nservice retailers in surrounding villages--such appoint-\nment of local distributors can help tap uncovered rural\nareas (Reddy, 1996). The resultant proposition is:\nP\n: Rural traditional retailers prefer local suppliers.\nApart from delivery and service frequency, studies\nthat rural retailers are motivated to stock and sell a\nbrand if a company provides them relatively higher\nmargins and commissions compared to other compa-\nnies selling similar products. The proposition that\nfollows is:\nP\n: Rural traditional retailers prefer selling brands\nwhich afford them higher margins and commissions.\nMarketers also often provide for discount schemes for\nretailers in rural markets to build relations (Sabura,\nthe positive impact of discount schemes by observing\nthat festival discounts given by the manufacturers to\nrural retailers normally contribute to increasing stock\nlevels in the shops (as cited in Velayudhan, 2007, p.\nP\n: Availability of discount schemes influences traditional\nrural retailers' purchase preference.\nRural retailers are motivated by quantity purchase\ndiscounts, which is a special kind of discount scheme,\nthat is, progressively higher discounts for higher\nvolume or value of purchases by a retailer (Jasim &\nthe significance of schemes to push up sales quanti-\nties to rural retailers. Bhattacharjee (2014) also affirms\nthat rural retailers are motivated by discount schemes\nprovided by marketers on lifting relatively large quan-\ntity of goods. It is, therefore, proposed that:\nP\n: Traditional rural retailers prefer to purchase goods for\nwhichtheygethigherpercentagediscountsonpurchasing\nlarger quantities, that is, quantity-based discounts.\nMarketers often have to keep the number of retailers\nlimited to prevent them from competing with each\nother by passing on their margins and discounts\nto consumers (selling below recommended retail\nprices)--this phenomenon is termed `undercut-\nting' (Zhu & Liu, 2011). Limiting the number of rural\nretailers, to whom stocks are supplied, prevents under-\ncutting and improves their margin (Kilaru, 1994, as\nemerges is:\nP\n: Rural traditional retailers patronize suppliers who\nprevent undercutting, that is, prevent retailers from selling\natbelowrecommendedretailpricestoensureprofitability.\nHowever, despite good service, a rural traditional\nretailer is often unable to carry stocks without credit\nfacility from suppliers (Siddique & Siddique, 2012). A\nstudy (Reardon & Berdegue, 2002), conducted in Latin\nAmerica, highlighted the immense financial burden\non rural retailers, since they provided credit to rural\nconsumers (a practice that has stopped in urban areas)--\nthis induces a need for supplier credit. Credit facility to\nrural retailers is necessary to get them to stock and sell\na marketer's products (Sabura et al., 2012). Thus, the\nfollowing proposition is developed:\nP\n: Credit from suppliers is a purchase preference factor\nfor rural traditional retailers, owing to their propensity\nto provide downstream credit to rural consumers.\nAn alternative to suppliers providing credit to retailers\nis the provision of credit lines from banks for stocking\nthe challenge faced by rural dealers, owing to the lack\nof banking facilities in many villages. Owing to the lack\nof adequate banking facilities and the resultant lack of\ncredit lines, retailers in rural areas are often unable to\ncarry adequate stocks (Reddy, 1996). This discussion\nleads to the following proposition:\nP\n: Traditional rural retailers prefer purchasing from\ncompanies or suppliers that arrange banking support, that\nis, credit lines from banks for rural traditional retailers.\nMargins, discount schemes, and credit have a direct\nbearing on the return of investment of a retailer\n(Fairhurst & Fiorito, 1990). Rural retailers demonstrate\na subsistence-type business orientation--they seem to\nbe content with a small profit as long as it covers their\nsubsistence needs (Viswanathan, 2007). It has often\nbeen suggested that a retailer bases his purchase and\nstocking decisions on the expected profit he can earn\nfrom that specific purchase (Ramanathan, 2006; Sezen,\n2004). Two interesting sub-propositions follow:\nP\n: (a) The viability of selling a brand should cover for\nsubsistence need of a retailer, with least investment\nof capital.\n(b) Purchases are preferably made from suppliers\nwho ensure viability through sufficient margins,\nschemes, and credit, since all these ensure returns on\ninvested capital.\nRural retailers also need to be equipped with informa-\ntion about products and trained on marketing prin-\nciples so that they can promote brands and products\n(Nyamulinda, Ganesan, & Musonera, 2009; Sulekha &\nof consumer information was a shop in the trading\nareas. Rural retailers need to improve their survival\nand continuance by building reciprocal relationships\nwith the community and consumers, and they can\ndo so by seeking training to improve their marketing\nstrategies (Jackson & Stoel, 2011). Sayulu and Reddy\n(1998) suggested that rural retailers provided charac-\nteristics of products to rural consumers. Pradhan (2010)\npresented a decision heuristic for rural retailers on the\nbasis of information availability. The set of propositions\nthat follow is:\nP\n: Rural traditional retailers need information and training\n(a) toimprovetheirownsellingskillstoruralconsumers\nand\n(b) to fulfil rural consumers' need for information.\nRural retailers can often do without information and\ntraining if they stock high-demand products, which\nrural consumers are familiar with (Bhatia & Bawa,\n2002). In a study of traditional rural retailer behav-\niour with respect to selected non-durable goods in\nNuagaon block, in Sundargarh district of Orissa,\nIndia, Kar and Das (2008) observed that rural retailers\noften avoided stocking goods that were not highly\ndemanded, owing to their lack of capital. While\na high variance in assortment composition may\nhelp retailers gain operational efficiencies, it often\nincreases the likelihood of a loss of sales in a product\nor service segment because of an absence of the\npreferred (high-demand) brands (Amine & Cadenat,\n2003). From this review of literature on the demand\nfactor, the following may be proposed:\nP\n: Consumer demand for a product or brand may be a\nfactor in purchase preference of rural traditional retailers.\nThe quality of products may be an antecedent to the\nrural demand for a brand (Prajapati & Thakor, 2012).\nHence, it has been suggested that retailers are moti-\nvated to sell higher quality products and brands (Jasim\n& Murali, 2013). The subsequent proposition is:\nP\n: Traditional rural retailers prefer purchasing stocks\nthat are of a higher perceived quality.\nIt has been observed that the appointment of\neducated, unemployed villagers as salesmen for\ntheir own villages would help in better execution of\nspecific strategies meant to ensure purchase prefer-\nence among rural traditional retailers (Khan & Khan,\n2012). Placement of locally selected company staff\nwould help fulfil the requirements of rural sales force\n(identified by Reddy, 1996)--salespeople in rural areas\nshould be acquainted with the local rural culture and\nshould speak the local language. Bhattacharjee (2014)\nindicated the positive impact of visits by company\nrepresentatives on the traditional rural retailers on the\nbasis of a study of 60 retailers spread over four villages\naround the city of Guwahati in India. Viswanathan\nin his list of six tasks in `rural marketing'. Hence, the\nfinal proposition is as follows:\nP\n: Placement of locally recruited salesmen, who are\naware of the local language and traditions, has a posi-\ntive influence on purchases by traditional rural retailers.\nMETHODOLOGY\nSampling Design and Data Gathering\nThe sampling method used was a systematic citation\nindex search using a combination of the phrases such\nas `developing nations', `rural marketing', `retailer',\n`shop', and `outlet'. A further attempt was made to\nfind all available literature on the subject by system-\natically checking citations in each source to identify\nfurther sources. Thirty-three sources were picked\nup and the complete texts of all these sources were\nanalysed. The sources used for content analysis are\npresented in Table 1. They are classified into three\nperiods to ensure nearly equal number of sources\nin each period. Phrases within the complete texts of\nthese sources, which indicate the factors of purchase\npreference of rural traditional retailers, are grouped\ninto 14 categories corresponding to the 14 identified\npropositions, for example, phrases like `delivery at\ndoorstep', `retailer prefers supplier visiting him', or\n`retailer would not go to wholesaler in feeder town\nif he gets stocks delivered to him' indicate the cate-\ngory corresponding to the proposition, P\n, `doorstep\ndelivery'. This categorization constitutes the basis for\nthis research.\nTable 1: Literature Used for Content Analysis\nSource: Literature with inferences about purchase preference factors of rural traditional retailers is grouped into time periods as part of the\npresent study, in order to have nearly equal number of sources in each period. The class intervals have been fixed with a view to distribute the\npapers evenly in terms of the accumulated work. The selection of four studies from 2011 has caused the minor skew.\nSome of the papers (e.g., Bhattacharjee, 2014; Jasim &\nsubject of rural retailers, while the rest suggest the\npossible factors of traditional rural retailer purchase\npreference as peripheral findings. This collection of\n`phrases', categorized into 14 groups, constitutes the\nbasis for this research.Acontent analysis begins with the\nassumption that the number of terms or phrases used in\nthe reviewed literature can be classified into a smaller\nnumber of categories because of similarities in meaning.\nThis classification was also verified with experts in the\nfield of rural marketing through in-depth interviews.\nPrincipal Component Analysis\nA categorical PCA (CATPCA method for categorical\ndata using SPSS 21.0) was conducted, using a tabula-\ntion of the identified categories, to trace the conceptual\ncore and the clusters. Various researchers (Kassarjian,\nnents analysis (PCA) to identify relationships between\nthe categories in different contexts. A casual reading\nof the text does not reveal the clusters, for example, an\nanalysis of literature pertaining to Human Resource\nManagement practices across Europe showed that the\nconceptual core of employee satisfaction is `control over\none's job' since three basic themes emerge as a cluster\nduring PCA, namely, `able to choose or change order\nof tasks', `able to choose or change methods of work',\nand `able to choose or change speed/rate of work'\nliterature on customer roles in value creation threw up\nfive clusters that denoted the five conceptual cores in the\nThe statistical technique of PCA for categorical data is\nCATPCA. The goal of PCA is to reduce an original set\nof variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated compo-\nnents that represent most of the information found in\nthe original variables (Muelman & Heiser, 2012). The\ntechnique is most useful when the presence of a large\nnumber of variables prohibits effective interpretation\nof the relationships between objects (subjects and units).\nBy reducing the dimensionality, we may interpret\na few components rather than a large number of vari-\nables (ibid.). Standard PCA assumes linear relation-\nships between numeric variables. On the contrary, the\noptimal-scaling approach, used in CATPCA, allows vari-\nables to be scaled at different levels. Categorical variables\nare optimally quantified in the specified dimensionality.\nAs a result, nonlinear relationships between variables\ncan be modelled (ibid.). With CATPCA, it is, therefore,\npossible to summarize the links between categories in a\nmulti-dimensional space. This space is very useful to\nrevealassociationsbetweendifferentcategories(clusters).\nCATPCAwas run on the data (using SPSS 21.0) with each\nsource being a separate case and each category being a\nseparate variable (taking values of `1', denoting presence\nof a category/theme in a source or `2', denoting absence\nof a category/theme in a source). The goal of PCA is the\ndimension reduction of the original set of variables into\na smaller set of uncorrelated components that charac-\nterize most of the information represented in the original\nvariables. The technique is valuable when occurrence of\na large number of variables prohibits effective interpre-\ntation of the relationships between themes prevalent in\nliterature on any particular topic. With CATPCA, it is,\ntherefore, possible to summarize the links between cate-\ngories in a multi-dimensional space.\nSuch an analysis reveals the clusters of themes, as mani-\nfested in studied literature, on any topic for which a\ncontent analytic study is conducted. A secondary check\nfor the existence of such clusters (denoting a conceptual\ncore in a topic) is performed to check whether clusters\nof related categories can be found in similar concepts in\nat least one research paper that is not used (to prevent\ncyclic conclusions) during the content-analysis process.\nThe revealed clusters help in presenting a discussion\nthat is well grounded in available literature.\nThe most important categories of words/phrases\nidentified through the content-analysis process were\nseparated and summarized. Table 2 shows the frequen-\ncies of appearance of each category in the sampled\nliterature. A count of the number of sources, where\na category (representing a factor of purchase prefer-\nence) occurs even once, is considered as the category\nfrequency (only one occurrence per source is counted),\nfor example, the first row of Table 2 suggests that the\nregular/frequent service category occurred in 16 of the\n33 sources used in the content analysis.\nTable 2: Category Frequencies of   Factors of\nTraditional Rural Retailers (as manifested in sampled literature)\nRank Category Frequency\n3 Information and Training need 12\n7 Prevention of undercutting 4\n7 High-demand products/brands 4\n9 Local distributor 3\n9 Quantity discount schemes 3\n9 Local company staff 3\nSource: Result of categorization of purchase preference factors of\ntraditional rural retailers available in literature by using the statistical\nmethod of frequency tabulation of content.\nExploratory Analysis\nWhile a spatial analysis of categories may reveal patterns\nin what authorities feel about rural retailer purchase\npreference, a temporal analysis enables a study of\nevolution of concepts in rural retailer purchase prefer-\nence from the lens of researchers. Some existing studies\n(e.g., Furrer, Thomas, & Goussevskaia, 2008; J\u00e4rvelin &\nVakkari, 1993) suggest the use of a temporal method of\ncontent analysis to trace the evolution of management\nconcepts.\nIn Table 3, the categories of the purchase preference\nfactors of traditional rural retailers have been classi-\nfied for different periods of time. As far as ordering in\ntime is concerned, the time period has been classified\ninto three nearly equal periods, starting with the first\nresearch work of Rao (1973) and ending with the last\nIn Table 3, the categories of purchase preference factors\nfor traditional rural retailers in developing nations are\nranked for different periods of time, on the basis of\nfrequency of occurrence of each of the factor in sampled\nliterature within the periods of study (only one occur-\nrence per source is counted). The higher the frequency\nof occurrence of a factor, the higher is the rank assigned\nto it within that period. The ranks are more important\nthan the frequencies in order to judge the primacy of\npurchase preference factors, as stated by authorities,\nover a 40-year period. The ranks reflect the primacy of\na factor in studies conducted in that period. Figure 1\ndepicts the longitudinal changes in frequencies in the\nform of an area graph, with the factor depicted on the\nleftmost side being the one with the highest overall\nfrequency and the rightmost being the factor with the\nlowest overall frequency. The need for information and\ntraining on new products and their selling techniques\nseem to have maintained the same significance (third\nrank) throughout the study period--this implies that\ntraditional rural retailers have always felt the unwa-\nvering need for information and training. The need\nfor discounts has also maintained almost a uniform\nranking over the period of study (elevating by one\nrank only in the second period). There is also a rela-\ntive stability in the need for regular/frequent service.\nDoorstep delivery has had the highest ranking in the\nfirst period, which is probably owing to the relative\nweakness of delivery systems during the early phase\nof rural marketing. The requirement for credit seems to\nincrease from the first period to the second period (rank\n5 to rank 1) and then decrease in the third period (from\nrank 1 to rank 3). The factor of margin and commission\nseems highly ranked only in the second period.

The eigen value for a\ndimension should be, in general, higher than 1 or the\nnumber of variables. In the analysis of retailer purchase\npreference factors, both dimensions have an eigen\nChronbach's alpha derived from this dimension\nreduction technique is 0.883 (shown in Table 4), which\nis higher than the minimum 0.7 value suggested by\nLance, Butts, and Michels (2006). In the CATPCA, the\ndefault number of two dimensions was used. It was\nalso checked whether three or more dimensions could\nbe distinguished. However, the available case data did\nnot substantiate three or more dimensions. Muelman\nand Heiser (2012) recommended keeping the number of\ndimensions small to make meaningful interpretations\nof the clusters possible. Approximately 40 per cent of\nthe total variance is explained by the two dimensions\n(Table 4), which is considered acceptable when using\ndimension reduction techniques for content analysis\nusing categorical data (as suggested for CATPCA by\nBuijzen & Valkenburg, 2004; Campos-Herrera et al.,\n2008). The total variance explained is the summation of\nvariances explained by each dimension.\nTable 4: Measures of Validity of CATPCA\nModel Summary\nDimension\nCronbach's\nAlpha\nVariance Accounted for\nTotal (Eigen value) % of Variance\nSource: Output of CATPCA analysis conducted using IBM SPSS 21.0.\nNote: a Total Cronbach's alpha is based on the total eigenvalue.\nComponent loadings were calculated for the categories\nin the analysis. The component loadings are basically\nthe Pearson correlations between the quantified vari-\nables and the dimensions (see Table A1 for correlation\nmatrices between categories). The component loadings\nof the categories placed in a two-dimensional diagram\nprovide a visual means for interpretation. Categories\nthat fit into the same cluster will have a similar loading\non a dimension, while categories that do not fit into the\nsame cluster will have loadings that are dissimilar.\nDetermining Core Concept and Clusters for\n  Factors\nFigure 2 presents the factor loadings of each cate-\ngory of traditional rural retailer purchase preference\nfactors to the two dimensions--a relatively higher\nloading on a dimension implies that the dimension is\nrepresented relatively better by the factor and a rela-\ntively lower loading on a dimension implies that the\ndimension is represented relatively modestly by the\nfactor. On the first dimension (the horizontal axis),\nmargin and commission (\u00ad0.58), prevention of under-\nquality brands (\u00ad0.29), high-demand products/brands\ntive component loadings, while the remaining catego-\nries quantity discount schemes (0.22), local company\nnent loadings. Hence, the categories with negative\nfactor loadings, with the exception of information and\ncommunication, seem to collectively indicate the prof-\nitability aspect of the retailer. Noticeably, the need\nfor information and communication has a low magni-\ntude of negative loading. The categories with positive\nfactor loadings, with the exception of quantity discount\nscheme, seem to collectively indicate the localization\naspect. In any case, the category of quantity discount\nschemes has a very low positive factor loading. Owing\nto the loadings of these categories, this dimension can\nbe possibly named as profitability versus localization\ndimension. This is because the categories with negative\nloadings are possibly related to the profitability of the\ntraditional rural retailer, whereas the categories with\npositive loadings within the first dimension are possibly\nrelated to the localization pursuit by marketers.\nOn the second dimension (the vertical axis), the cate-\ngories information and training need (\u00ad0.37) and\nhigh-quality brands (\u00ad0.15) have negative factor load-\nings, while the rest of the categories--viability (0.02),\nprevention of undercutting (0.13), doorstep delivery\nlocal company staff (0.42), high-demand products/\nand quantity discount schemes (0.78)--have positive\nfactor loadings. In the second dimension, the higher\npositive loadings are for discounts and quantity\ndiscount schemes and the negative loading is low for\nhigh-quality brands. Therefore, the second dimension\ncan be possibly named as gross margin.\nFigure 2: Component Loadings of Factors of Traditional Rural\nRetailer  \nDimension 2\nDimension 1\nVariable Principal Normalization.\nObject Points Labeled by Case Numbers\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nComponent Loadings\nDimension\nVariable principal normalization\nSource: Output of CATPCA conducted using IBM SPSS 21.0.\nOnce the dimensions have been determined, the core\nconcepts and the different clusters can be determined. A\nfactor loading of around 0.3 or above on both dimensions\n(in a two-dimensional solution) indicates a cross-loading\nin content-analysis studies (Verbeke et al., 1998)--this\nresearch uses a similar benchmark. There is a substan-\ntial overlap among some categories as seen from the\ncross-loadings that run across the two dimensions as can\nbe seen through a visual examination of the factors' load-\nings presented under the graph in Figure 2. The main\noverlapsareinthecategoriesofregularservice,discounts,\nand margins and commissions. In a minor way, there is\noverlap in quantity discount schemes, credit, local distrib-\nutor, local company staff, and high-demand products and\nbrands. These overlaps suggest the possible vestiges of a\nconceptual framework of a set of factors needed to moti-\nvate retailers to stock and sell products and brands--a\nframework that rural marketers need to understand and\nevoke while planning and implementing rural marketing\nstrategies. Thus, while CATPCA creates two dimensions,\nthere appears substantial overlap among the categories\nacross the dimensions. Hence, we can possibly conclude\nthat traditional rural retailer purchase preference requires\na set of factors that marketers have to ensure.\nFrom the factor loadings for the two dimensions, some\nclusters can be discerned. High-demand products and\nbrands, and credit form one cluster--both have close\nlevels of loadings for dimension 1 as well as dimen-\nsion 2 and can be visually discerned if a graphical plot\nis made of the values in two axes. Doorstep delivery\nand regular service form a second cluster. It will also\nbe checked if these clusters reflect exact content from\nconclusions in at least one research paper that is\nnot used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the\ncontent-analysis process.\nBased on the analysis using CATPCA, as presented in\nFigure 2, it is found that there is a core concept and a\nset of clusters, which represents conceptual variations\naround the core concept. This core concept of traditional\nrural purchase preference factors include the overlap-\nping categories of regular service, discounts, margins\nand commissions, quantity discount schemes, credit,\nlocal distributor, local company staff, and high-demand\nproducts and brands. Therefore, the core purchase pref-\nerence factors of traditional rural retailers can be identi-\nfied as these overlapping categories of regular service,\ndiscounts, margins and commissions, quantity discount\nschemes, credit, local distributor, local company staff,\nand high-demand products and brands.\nCATPCA has yielded two discernible clusters, as seen\nin Figure 2. High-demand products and brands, and\ncredit form one cluster. Doorstep delivery and regular\nservice form a second cluster. If the clusters, which\nemerge during the content analysis of factors of tradi-\ntional rural retailer purchase preference, reflect exact\ncontent from conclusions in at least one article that\nis not used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the\ncontent-analysis process, it would imply that there\nis a conceptual core to the academic thought on the\nsubject (as suggested by, Verbeke et al., 1998). Some\nconclusions in relatively recent studies (not included as\npart of content analysis to prevent cyclic error) about\nthe purchase preference factors of traditional rural\nretailers are presented here, which correspond to the\nclusters that emerged:\n(There is a) reluctance on the part of the semi-wholesalers\nand wholesalers to give more quantities (at a single purchase\ninstance, indicating High Demand Products and Brands)\nto the rural retailer as they would not be sure if the retailer\nwould come back to them for the next purchase, the sale\nThe Shakti entrepreneur (HUL's rural distributor based\nin village) offers personalized service, doorstep delivery,\nand an assurance of quality to rural retailers. (Rangan &\nAll possible efforts should be made to make the products\navailable at the doorstep of the target audience ... a strong\ndistribution system, which helps brands reach the interiors\nThis reflection of clusters in inferences present in\nresearch papers, which are not part of the statistical\ncontent analysis, substantiates the conclusion that\nstudies pertaining to purchase preference factors of\nrural traditional retailers have a conceptual core.\nDISCUSSION\nThe objective of this study is to identify the factors\nthat motivate traditional rural retailers in devel-\noping nations and to conceptualize a hierarchy of\nthose needs based on a quantitative content analysis\nusing statistical techniques. Rural retailers appear\nas the key influencer of rural sales and scholars and\nmarketers feel the need to understand this entity\nbetter. Many authors have made conclusions about\nrural retailers while studying other aspects of rural\nmarketing, but dedicated studies on traditional rural\nretailers in developing nations are rare and gener-\nally constrained by their width of study (all study\nless than 100 retailers or focus on products from a\nsingle company or are very qualitative in nature).\nThis indeed makes a search for content difficult but\nthese papers do provide a starting point for a serious\nand more extensive study of rural retailers. This is\nthe first attempt to conceptualize the purchase pref-\nerence factors for a traditional rural retailer using\nstatistical methods.\nConceptual Core of Academic Thought on\nTraditional Rural Retailers'  \nFactors\nThe result from CATPCA suggests a conceptual core for\nthe factors that influence a rural retailer's propensity\nto stock and sell a marketer's brands and products.\nThese accepted core factors indicate that a traditional\nrural retailer can possibly be persuaded to purchase\nhigh-demand products and brands, through the provi-\nsion of credit, discounts, quantity discount schemes,\nmargins and commissions, using local distributor\n(based in village itself) and company staff, who should\nprovide regular service.\nCATPCA has yielded two discernible clusters: High-\ndemand products and brands and credit; and doorstep\ndelivery and regular service. The clusters that emerge\nduring the content analysis of factors of traditional\nrural retailer purchase preference reflect exact content\nfrom conclusions in at least one research paper that\nis not used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the\ncontent-analysis process. This confirms that researchers\nhave been moving on similar lines in their conceptual-\nizations of the purchase preference factors of traditional\nrural retailers. This makes it easier for further research\nto be conducted using the categories/themes identified\nin this research.\nIdentifying the Evolution of Studies on Traditional\nRural Retailers'  \nThis research also presents a longitudinal analysis of\nthe categories over a period of 40 years. Traditional\nrural retailers have always felt the unwavering need\nfor information and training. The need for discounts\nhas also maintained almost a uniform ranking over the\nperiod of study. There is also a relative stability in the\nneed for regular/frequent service. Doorstep delivery\nhad the highest ranking in the first period, which is\nprobably owing to the relative weakness of delivery\nsystems during the early phase of rural marketing. The\nrequirement for credit seems to increase from the first\nperiod to the second period and then decreases in the\nthird period. The factor of margins and commissions\nseems highly ranked only in the second period. For rest\nof the factors, no valid temporal pattern can possibly be\ndiscerned with certainty.\nThis study, however, has some limitations. First, it may\nhave left out some research papers and books of minor\nimportance, since a systematic citation search method\nhas been used as the sampling method. The result\nmay be made more robust by including more content\non traditional rural retailer. Second, the categorization\nof factors and the propositions postulated are based\non judgemental calls by the experts consulted. Some\njudgemental errors may have crept in while catego-\nrizing the terms found in literature.\nSince this study is based on literature relevant to devel-\noping nations, it may not be applicable to mature\nmarkets. There may be some more factors that are impor-\ntant determinants of purchase decisions by traditional\nrural retailers and these may have got left out since the\nsampled studies have not mentioned these factors.\nThe 14 factors that are presented in this study may\npossibly guide rural marketers in designing and\nimplementing rural marketing strategies. Since tradi-\ntional rural retailers form the conduit for marketers\nto reach rural consumers, it follows that an under-\nstanding of the factors influencing rural retailers in\nstocking and selling decisions would help a marketer\nin tapping into rural markets. The ranking of the\nfactors also provides some idea about the importance\nof each of these factors, since a larger number of\nstudies stressing on a particular factor generally\nimply a greater significance of that particular factor\n(as suggested in a similar study by Verbeke et al.,\n1998). The clusters discerned through PCA imply\nthat regular service at doorsteps of rural, tradi-\ntional retailers, and providing credit for high-sales\nbrands should be important strategic imperatives for\na marketer who is keen to penetrate rural markets\nthrough traditional retailers.\nFuture studies may use the 14 identified factors of\npurchase preference to conduct empirical research on\nrural traditional retailers in developing nations. Such\nstudies may even attempt to build a path diagram to\nrepresentpurchasebehaviourofruraltraditionalretailers.\nCONCLUSION\nThis article points out that the research inferences,\nmade in core as well as peripheral studies, on purchase\npreference factors for traditional rural retailers in devel-\noping nations comprise of a conceptual core. Although\nresearchers have worked on multiple dimensions of\nrural marketing in developing nations, investigations\non traditional rural retailers have only been at the\nperiphery of studies. The aim of this research has been\nto analyse possibly all the research conducted on rural\nretailers and find out the purchase preference factors of\na rural retailer. Content analysis has been used to find\nout the categories of factors influencing the purchase\npreference of traditional rural retailers in stocking and\nselling goods and services. This article also provides\n14 categories of factors that motivate rural retailers,\nwhich would help marketers in planning and imple-\nmentation of rural marketing strategies. These 14 cate-\ngories can also be used as a starting point for further\nempirical research.\nAPPENDIX\nTable A1: Relation between Categories\nDoorstep\nDelivery\nRegular\nService\nHigh-\nquality\nProducts Discounts\nHigh-\nquality\nBrands\nMargin and\nCommission\nQuantity\nDiscount\nSchemes Viability Credit\nLocal\nDistributor\nLocal\nCompany\nStaff\nInformation\nand Training\nNeed\nPrevention\nof Under-\ncutting\nHigh-demand\nProducts/\nBrands\nDoorstep\ndelivery\n*\nRegular\nservice\nHigh-quality\nproducts\nHigh-quality\nbrands\nMargin and\ncommission\nQuantity\ndiscount\nschemes\nLocal\ndistributor\nLocal\ncompany\nstaff\nInformation\nand training\nneed\nPrevention of\nundercutting\nHigh-\ndemand\nproducts/\nbrands\nSource: Output of CATPCA analysis conducted using IBM SPSS 21.0.
