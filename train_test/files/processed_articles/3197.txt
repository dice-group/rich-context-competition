Finding an answer to this question may help\ninvestors to refine theories of derivatives pricing, to compute more exact solutions to\nproblems of optimal portfolio selection, and to efficiently monitor and manage financial\nrisks. Macroeconomists and policy makers can benefit from finding an answer to this\nquestion because it may help them to develop a better understanding of potential\nmacroeconomic determinants of systematic financial-sector risk.\nWe studied whether it is important to account for the fact that macroeconomic data are\nsubject to substantial historical revisions when one studies the link between\nmacroeconomic variables and stock market volatility. Empirical research so far has not\nshed light on this question because, to the best of our knowledge, only revised\nmacroeconomic data have been used to analyze macroeconomic determinants of stock\nmarket volatility.\nIn order to close this gap in the literature, our research contributes to the literature on\nthe macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility in three dimensions.

Introduction\nMacroeconomic variables play a key role in asset pricing theories. For this reason,\nmany authors have empirically studied the link between macroeconomic variables and\nstock market volatility. A common finding in these studies is that stock market volatility\ntends to rise in periods of business cycle downturns (Errunza and Hogan 1998, Schwert\n1989, Hamilton and Lin 1996). For investors, this finding raises the question of whether\nmacroeconomic variables that capture business cycle fluctuations help to forecast stock\nmarket volatility. Finding an answer to this question may help investors to refine\ntheories of derivatives pricing, to compute more exact solutions to problems of optimal\nportfolio selection, and to efficiently monitor and manage financial risks. Finding an\nanswer to this question may also be useful for macroeconomists, politicians, and central\nbankers to develop a better understanding of potential macroeconomic determinants of\nsystematic financial-sector risk.\nFor an investor who seeks to forecast stock market volatility based on\nmacroeconomic variables, a key question is whether it is important to account for the\nfact that macroeconomic data are subject to substantial historical revisions. To the best\nof our knowledge, empirical evidence that may help an investor to answer this question\nis not yet available. In the earlier empirical literature, only revised macroeconomic data\nhave been used to analyze macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility. In\nfact, only a few studies are available that report evidence of the implications of using\nreal-time macroeconomic data for research in empirical finance (see, for example,\n* Christian Pierdzioch, Saarland University, Department of Economics P.O.B. 15 11 50,\nc.pierdzioch@mx.uni-saarland.de (corresponding author); J\u00f6rg D\u00f6pke, Deutsche\nBundesbank, Economics Department, Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14, Frankfurt, Germany.\nSaarbruecken, Germany, e-mail: da.hartmann@mx.uni-saarland.de. The authors would\nlike to thank Heinz Herrmann and seminar participants at the Deutsche Bundesbank for\nhelpful comments on an earlier draft version of this paper.\n2003). By contrast, the analysis of real-time macroeconomic data has a long tradition in\nresearch on macroeconomics and business-cycle fluctuations (Croushore 2001,\nCroushore and Stark 2003, Orphanides and van Norden 2002, Orphanides and Williams\nOur contribution to the literature on the macroeconomic determinants of stock\nmarket volatility is threefold. First, by using a new monthly real-time macroeconomic\ndata set for Germany that covers the period 1994-2005, we accounted for the fact that,\nin real time, an investor can only make inferences about the macroeconomic\ndeterminants of stock market volatility by fully exploiting the then available\ninformation set. This information set only contains the then latest release of preliminary\nreal-time macroeconomic data, but not later releases of revised macroeconomic data.\nWe also accounted for the fact that, in real time, an investor must take into account that\npreliminary real-time macroeconomic data may only give a noisy account of business\ncycle fluctuations. Therefore, we analyzed three different potential macroeconomic\ndeterminants of stock market volatility: the growth rate of industrial production, orders\ninflow, and a measure of the output gap. In the earlier literature, empirical studies of the\nmacroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility have focused on the growth rate\nof industrial production as a measure of business cycle fluctuations (Schwert 1989,\nSecond, we employed a recursive modeling approach to analyze whether\nmacroeconomic variables help to forecast stock market volatility in real time. By doing\nthis, we accounted for the fact that an investor's information set changes over time. In\nthe earlier literature, it has been common practice to use an information set based on a\nfull-sample of revised data to analyze whether macroeconomic variables help to forecast\nstock market volatility (Schwert 1989). Such an information set, however, is not\navailable to an investor in real time. In consequence, it cannot be used by an investor to\nprice derivative securities and to solve portfolio allocation problems in real time. In\norder to capture changes in an investor's information set over time, we employed a\nrecursive modeling approach (Pesaran and Timmermann 1995, 2000). An advantage of\nusing a recursive modeling approach is that it also allows the out-of-sample forecasting\nability of macroeconomic variables for stock market volatility to be analyzed. Out-of-\nsample tests have received increasing attention in the recent empirical finance literature\nThird, we used three different criteria to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of\nstock market volatility. The first criterion is a statistical criterion. We used the root-\nmean squared error as a statistical criterion to evaluate volatility forecasts. The\nadvantage of this statistical criterion is that it has been widely used in academic research\nand can easily be applied by practitioners. The second criterion is the utility-based\ncriterion developed by West et al. (1993) and recently applied by Fleming et al. (2001)\nto evaluate volatility forecasts. The utility-based criterion provides a microeconomic\nfoundation for forecast evaluation. The third criterion is an option-based criterion to\nevaluate volatility forecasts. Similar criteria have been developed by Engle et al. (1996)\nand Engle et al. (1997). The idea behind the option-based criterion is to simulate a\nsynthetic options market in which investors trade options based on their different\nvolatility forecasts. By comparing profits of investors, it is possible to evaluate\ndifferences between volatility forecasts in economic terms.\nOur main result is that the value of volatility forecasts based on real-time\nmacroeconomic data is roughly comparable to the value of volatility forecasts based on\nrevised macroeconomic data. Forecasting stock market volatility by means of noisy\nreal-time rather than reliable revised macroeconomic data does not systematically\nreduce investors' average utility. Furthermore, an investor who used real-time\nmacroeconomic data for volatility forecasting would have realized profits in our\nsynthetic options market comparable to those an investor would have reaped who based\nvolatility forecasts on revised macroeconomic data. Our result, thus, demonstrates that\nan investor who wants to set up an investment strategy in real time can in general make\nuse of results reported in the earlier literature on the macroeconomic determinants of\nstock market volatility that were derived by using revised macroeconomic variables.\nWe organize the remainder of this paper as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the\nrecursive modeling approach we used to study the implications of using real-time\nmacroeconomic data for forecasting stock market volatility. We also lay out the criteria\nwe used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility. In Section 3, we\ndescribe the macroeconomic and financial data we considered to be relevant for\nforecasting stock market volatility. In Section 4, we present our results. In Section 5, we\noffer some concluding remarks.\n2. Modeling and Evaluating Volatility Forecasts\nIn order to simulate how an investor may forecast stock market volatility in real\ntime, we used a recursive modeling approach. In order to evaluate the accuracy of\nforecasts implied by our recursive modeling approach, we used a statistical, a utility-\nbased, and an options-based criterion. We used our recursive modeling approach and the\nthree forecast-evaluation criteria to compare forecasts of stock market volatility based\non real-time macroeconomic data with forecasts based on revised macroeconomic data.\n2.1 Recursive Modeling of Stock Market Volatility\nWe considered an investor who uses a set of macroeconomic and financial\nvariables to predict stock market volatility. In period of time t, the information set of the\ninvestor contains real-time information on macroeconomic and financial variables up to\nand including period of time t. The investor seeks to combine these variables in an\noptimal forecasting model for stock market volatility. The investor does not know\nwhich variables to include in the optimal model, nor does the investor know the true\nassumed that the investor applies a recursive modeling approach in order to identify the\noptimal forecasting model. This recursive modeling approach proceeds in two steps. In\na first step, the optimal forecasting model for stock market volatility is identified. This\nis done by searching the optimal forecasting model, in each period of time, in a\nsystematic way over a large number of different models that feature different\nmacroeconomic and financial variables. In a second step, this search recursively restarts\nin order to permanently update the optimal forecasting model as time progresses.\nIn each period of time, t, the investor considers a set of K macroeconomic and\nfinancial variables that may be useful for making a one-period-ahead forecast of stock\nmarket volatility. The optimal forecasting model in period t is identified by searching\nover all possible permutations of the variables under consideration. From this it follows,\nthat the number of forecasting models becomes very large as the number of variables\nincreases. For example, we considered in our empirical analysis nine macroeconomic\nand financial variables to be relevant for forecasting one-period-ahead stock market\nvolatility. In order to conduct this search over a large number of forecasting models in\nand used the ordinary least squares technique to estimate, in each period of time t, linear\nregression models of the following format:\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\nX\ny\n,\n,\n' +\n+\n+\n= \nwhere\n+\nt\ny denotes the vector of changes in the natural logarithm of stock market\nvolatility from period 0 up to and including period 1\n+\nt . We model changes in the\nnatural logarithm of stock market volatility because we used, as we will describe in\ndetail in Section 2.2.3, an options-based criterion to model stock market volatility. In\nthe options literature, it has become common practice to assume that volatility follows a\ngeometric stochastic process (see, for example, Hull and White 1987, Heston 1993).\nThe subscript i denotes the model the investor studies,\ni\n denotes the vector of\nparameters under model i,\ni\nt ,\n+\n denotes a stochastic disturbance term, and\ni\nt\nX\n,\ndenotes\nthe set of regressors under model i. The set of regressors under model i,\ni\nt\nX\n,\n, is a subset\nof the set of all macroeconomic and financial regressors the investor considers to be\nrelevant for forecasting stock market volatility. The vector of regressors always includes\na constant.\nIn order to identify the optimal forecasting model, the investor needs a model-\nselection criterion to select, in each period of time t, the optimal forecasting model\namong the large number of estimated forecasting models. We assumed that the investor\nconsiders three alternative model-selection criteria: the Adjusted Coefficient of\nDetermination (ACD), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, Akaike 1973), and the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC, Schwarz 1978). The ACD, AIC, and BIC model-\nselection criteria have two key advantages. First, these model-selection criteria are\nwidely used in applied research and an investor can easily compute them. Second, these\nmodel-selection criteria were readily available to investors during the entire sample\nperiod. This is important because our plan is to simulate how an investor forecasts stock\nmarket volatility in real time. Hence, it is important that the investor bases forecasts of\nstock market volatility only on information and model-selection criteria which were\navailable in the period of time in which the forecasts had to be made.\n2.2 Forecast-Evaluation Criteria\nIn order to evaluate and compare volatility forecasts made on the basis of real-\ntime and revised macroeconomic data, we used three different criteria: a statistical\ncriterion, a utility-based criterion, and an options-based criterion.\nWe used the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the statistical accuracy\nof forecasts of stock market volatility. The RMSE is defined as the square root of the\nmean of the sum of the squared differences between forecasts of stock market volatility\nand actual stock market volatility. In addition to the RMSE, we also computed a statistic\nin the tradition of the U statistic that has been suggested by Theil (1966). Our version of\nTheil's U statistic compares the accuracy of forecasts from a forecasting model that uses\nreal-time macroeconomic data with that from a forecasting model that uses revised\nmacroeconomic data. We computed our U statistic as the ratio of the RMSE of a\nforecasting model that uses real-time macroeconomic data and the RMSE of a\nforecasting model that uses revised macroeconomic data. Thus, our U statistic is defined\nas follows:\nrevised\ntime\nreal\nRMSE\nRMSE\nA utility-based criterion provides a microeconomic foundation for the evaluation\nof the accuracy of volatility forecasts. In order to set up a utility-based criterion, we\nfollowed West et al. (1993) and considered a mean-variance maximizing investor who\nmaximizes the following utility function:\n)\n(\n)\n(\n+\n+\n-\n=\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nW\nVar\nW\nE\nU\nwhere\n+\nt\nU denotes utility in period 1\n+\nt ,\nt\nE denotes the conditional expectations\noperator,\nt\nVar denotes the conditional variance operator,  denotes the investor's taste\nfor risk, and\n+\nt\nW denotes the wealth of the investor in period 1\n+\nt . The dynamics of the\ninvestor's wealth can be described in terms of the following period-by-period budget\nconstraint:\n]\n)\n[(\n,\n+\n+\n+\n-\n=\nt\nt\nF\nt\nt\nfR\nR\nf\nW\nwhere f denotes the fraction of wealth invested in stocks,\nF\nR denotes the gross\nreturn on a riskless one-period bond, and\n+\nt\nR denotes the gross return on stocks in\n+\nt . For simplicity, we assume that the riskless interest rate is constant. Upon\nmaximizing (3) with respect to f subject to (4) and assuming that the investor's\ncoefficient of relative risk aversion, )\n/(\nt\nt\nW\nW \n\n -\n , is constant, the optimal\nproportion of wealth invested in stocks can be computed as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n+\n=\n+\n+\n+\n,\nt\nt\nF\nt\nh\nR\nf\n\u00b5\n\nwhere\n+\nt\n\u00b5 denotes the conditional mean of stock returns in period of time 1\n+\nt .\nWe assume that the investor knows the conditional mean of stock returns, but does not\nknow the conditional variance,\n+\nt\nh . One could extend the analysis to incorporate the\neffects of estimation risk with regard to mean returns on the investor's investment\ndecision (Fleming et al. 2001). However, this estimation risk would affect investment\ndecisions based on both volatility forecasts derived from real-time and revised\nmacroeconomic data. Thus, our utility-based measures should reliably indicate the\nrelative value of volatility forecasts.\nThe investor uses the recursive estimation approach described in Section 2.1 to\nobtain forecasts of the conditional variance,\n^\n+\nt\nh . These estimates can be used in (5) to\ncompute the conditional expectations and the conditional variance of wealth in period\n+\nt . Investor's expected utility may then be written as\n)\n(\n)\n(\n,\nt\nt\nF\nt\nt\nt\nu\nd\nR\nW\nU\nE +\n=\n+\n+\n)\n](\n/\n)\n[(\nF\nt\nt\nR\nd -\n+\n=\n+\n\u00b5\n\n and\n^\n/\n.\n^\n/\n+\n+\n-\n=\nt\nt\nt\nt\nh\nh\nh\nu . The right-hand\nside of (6) shows that the utility-based criterion is asymmetric insofar as underestimates\nof the variance of stock market returns lead to a lower expected utility than\noverestimates of the same magnitude.\nBecause the investor does not know\n+\nt\nh , the result given in (6) cannot be directly\nused to evaluate forecasts of stock market volatility. However, West et al. (1993) have\nproposed to get an estimate of\n+\nt\nh that is right on average by replacing\n+\nt\nh with the ex-\npost realized squared log difference in stock prices, r\nt\nh\n+\n. Holding\nt\nW fixed, average\nutility can be computed as\n\n=\n+\n+\n\nTF\nt\nt\nt\nt\nF\nt\nu\nd\nR\nW\nTF\nU\n,\n)\n(\nwhere TF denotes the number of forecasts. In a large sample, U will be close to\nthe average of the conditional expectation of utility, \n= +\nTF\nt t\nt\nU\nE\nTF\n)\n(\n)\n/\n( .\nAverage utility as defined in (7) can be compared across models in order to\nevaluate the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility. To this end, we followed\nWest et al. (1993) and expressed differences in the accuracy of forecasts of stock market\nvolatility across models in terms of a wealth-sacrifice ratio. This wealth-sacrifice ratio is\nexpressed in terms of annual basis points. Denoting average utility of an optimal model\nby\nU , and average utility of a suboptimal model,\nm\nU , the wealth-sacrifice ratio, WSR ,\ncan be computed as\n)\n/\n(\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n-\n\u00d7\n= U\nU\nWSR\nm\nm\nwhere the first 100 converts to percentage, the second one converts to basis\npoints, and the 12 converts WSR to annual basis points. The WSR can be interpreted to\nrepresent the average fee that the investor would be willing to pay to switch from a\nsuboptimal forecasting model, m, to the optimal forecasting model.\nThe options-based criterion we used to analyze the accuracy of forecasts of stock\nmarket volatility is similar to the options-based criteria developed by Engle et al. (1996)\nand Engle et al. (1997). They have suggested simulating a synthetic options market to\ntest the relative accuracy of volatility forecasts. In the options market that we simulated,\ntwo traders interact. One trader derives forecasts of stock market volatility from a model\nthat features real-time macroeconomic data, and the other trader from a model that\nfeatures revised macroeconomic data. Both traders trade one-month options on a one\neuro share of the DAX30 portfolio. In each period of time, traders invest in a \"straddle\",\nthat is, they invest in one European call option and one European put option. The strike\nprices of both options is equal to the forward rate, )\n(\n,\n-\nt\nF\nR\nexp . Using their forecasts of\nstock market volatility, both traders use the Black-Scholes formula to value options\n(Black and Scholes 1973). According to this formula, the price of a call (or put) option\nis given by\n)\n(\n-\n= d\nN\nC\nt\n, ,\nM\nh\n^\n.\nd\nt\nwhere\nt\nC denotes the call (or put) price, (.)\nN denotes the cumulative normal\ndistribution function, M denotes the time-to-maturity of the option, and\n^\n+\nt\nh denotes\nthe forecast of the variance of monthly stock market returns. Using (9), the value of a\nstraddle is given by 2\n)\n(\n-\nd\nN .\nDepending on their forecasts of stock market volatility, traders are either long or\nshort in a straddle. The trader whose volatility forecast is larger buys one straddle, and\nthe trader whose volatility forecast is smaller sells one straddle. If traders' volatility\nforecasts are identical, we assume that both are short in one straddle. Transactions are\nexecuted at the average of the seller's and buyer's price. At the end of a month, buyers\nand sellers positions are closed and profits/losses are computed. We used the realized\nmonthly stock market returns, )\n( -\nt\nR\nexp , to compute the profit from each trade.\n3. The Data\nThe description of our data comes in three parts. In the first part, we describe our\ndata on stock market volatility. In the second part, we describe our real-time\nmacroeconomic data for Germany. In the third part, we describe the other variables we\nconsidered to be of potential importance for forecasting stock market volatility.\n3.1 Stock Market Volatility\nIn order to measure stock market volatility, we used data on the VDAX-NEW\nindex collected and disseminated by the German stock exchange (Deutsche Boerse).\nThe VDAX-NEW index is an options-based index of stock market volatility that\nsummarizes market participants' sentiment regarding the standard deviation of returns\nof the DAX30. The VDAX-NEW index measures the square root of the implied\nvariances. It has a constant time-to-maturity of 30 days. This is convenient because our\nmacroeconomic data are available at a monthly frequency. The Deutsche Boerse\ncomputes the VDAX-NEW index based on the implied variances of at-the-money and\nout-of-the-money options with the same time-to-maturity. Because both at-the-money\nand out-of-the-money options are considered, the VDAX-NEW index summarizes\ninformation on the shape of the volatility-strike structure (the so-called \"volatility\nsmile\"). Data for the VDAX-NEW index are available at a daily frequency for the\navoid problems due to overlapping data. Figure 1 plots the VDAX-NEW index for the\nperiod we considered in our forecasting analysis (1995-2005). A detailed description of\nhow the VDAX-NEW index is computed can be found in Deutsche Boerse (2005).\nBecause stock market volatility is not directly observable, various estimators have\nbeen developed in the literature. In consequence, using an options-based index is only\none choice an investor can make to estimate stock market volatility. Because alternative\nestimators are available, an investor could ask whether the results we shall report in\nSection 4 are sensitive to the choice of the estimator of stock market volatility. In order\nto analyze the sensitivity of our results, we did not only study our options-based index\nof stock market volatility, but also considered two alternative estimators. The first\nalternative estimator is the monthly average of squared stock market returns. For an\ninvestor, it is very simple to compute this estimator in real time. The second alternative\nestimator is a GARCH model. To this end, we used daily data on returns of the DAX30\nto estimate a GARCH(1,1) model and stored the conditional volatility of returns implied\nby this model. We then computed monthly averages of the estimated conditional\nvolatility. We found that both alternative estimators yielded estimates of stock market\nvolatility that resemble the options-based VDAX-NEW index of stock market volatility.\nThus, using the two alternative estimators of stock market volatility does not affect our\nmain result that the statistical and economic value of volatility forecasts based on real-\ntime data is comparable to the value of forecasts based on revised macroeconomic data.\nWe, therefore, report in Section 4 only results for our options-based volatility index.\nResults for the other two estimators of stock market volatility are available from us\nupon request.\n3.2 Real-Time Macroeconomic Data for Germany\nIn order to study the macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility, we\nused a monthly real-time macroeconomic dataset for important macroeconomic\nbusiness-cycle indicators for the German economy. The dataset was provided by the\nDeutsche Bundesbank. Data sources are the Bundesbank's regularly published monthly\npublications of seasonally adjusted macroeconomic data (Saisonbereinigte\nWirtschaftszahlen). We used real-time data for month-to-month growth rates of\nindustrial production (without construction) and orders inflow. In addition, we\ncomputed a real-time measure of the output gap. The output gap is defined as the\ndifference between actual output and potential output. We measured potential output by\napplying the Hodrick-Prescott filter (Hodrick and Prescott 1997) to our real-time data\nfor industrial production, where we set the smoothing parameter to 14,400. Finally, we\nused real-time data for the annualized growth rate of the consumer-price index as a real-\ntime measure of inflation.\nData were available for every month since January 1994. Our sample of real-time\nmacroeconomic data starts in 1994 because all data releases from this period of time\nonwards refer to Germany as a whole. The data are organized in vintages. A vintage\ncontains the time series of a macroeconomic variable that was available to an investor in\nuse in our empirical analysis 123 vintages of each macroeconomic variable. In order to\nstart our recursive modeling approach, we added to each vintage data that go back to\nNovember 1991. To be more specific, we started our recursive modeling approach by\ninitial estimates of the model-selection criteria.\nIn our empirical analyses, we accounted for the fact that macroeconomic data are\nusually published with a time lag. We also accounted for the fact that the publication lag\nchanged over time. For example, in the case of industrial production the year 1995\nprovides a remarkable example for irregularities with regard to the publication of\nmacroeconomic data. In the year 1995, the German Federal Statistical Office did not\npublish data on industrial production from February to June. The reason for this\ninterruption of the usual publication rhythm was a conceptual change in the calculation\nof the time series. From June to August 1995, it published two data per month to get\nback to the regular publication lag of two months. We dealt with irregularities in the\npublication of macroeconomic data by considering an investor who always used the\nthen latest publicly available data. In case no new data were released, we assumed that\nthe investor used the then most recent data of the then most recently published vintage\nto fill any gaps in the data. This assumption does not distort the information set\navailable to an investor because it implies that the investor only uses then publicly\navailable data to forecast excess returns.\nTable 1 -- Summary Statistics of Revisions of Real-Time Macroeconomic Data\nSummary statistics Mean NSR Minimum Maximum\nIndustrial production\nOrders inflow\nCPI\nOutput gap\nNote: In this table, we provide summary statistics for revisions after one month, two months, six months,\none year, and final revisions (i.e., revisions at the end of our sample period). For example, revisions after\none month are computed by taking the difference between the first release and the second release of data.\nThe noise-to-signal, NSR, is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of revisions and the standard\ndeviation of final-release data. CPI is defined as the consumer price index inflation.\nIn order to analyze differences between real-time and revised macroeconomic\ndata, we provide summary statistics of revisions of our real-time macroeconomic data in\nTable 1. The summary statistics in Table 1 indicate that, as a rule, revisions do not have\na zero mean, suggesting that there are some systematic differences between data\nbelonging to different vintages. Moreover, the noise-to-signal ratios are substantial. The\nnoise-to-signal ratio is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of revisions and the\nstandard deviation of revised data (Orphanides and van Norden 2002). The noise-to-\nsignal ratios reveal that the standard deviations of revisions are at least about one third\nas large as the standard deviation of the revised data. There are even some cases in\nwhich the standard deviation of revisions exceeds the standard deviation of the revised\ndata. Furthermore, the minimum and maximum values of revisions are quite large. This\nimplies that an investor who must use first-releases of our macroeconomic data to\nforecast stock returns uses highly inaccurate macroeconomic data. This motivates a\ncloser look on the implications of using real-time macroeconomic data for forecasting\nstock market volatility.\nIn addition to real-time macroeconomic data, we considered a number of other\nvariables to be potentially relevant for forecasting stock market volatility. We\ndownloaded most of the data from Thomson Financial Datastream. Our list of variables\nis the following (abbreviations and Datastream codes are given in parentheses):\n1. The relative three-month Treasury bill rate (RTB) and the term spread\n(TSP). RTB is defined as the difference between the three-month Treasury\nbill rate (BDI60C..) and its 12-month backward-looking moving average.\nTSP is defined as the difference between the long-term government bond\nyield (BDI61...) and the three-month Treasury bill rate.\n2. A January dummy (JAN). JAN plays an important role in the literature on\nfinancial market anomalies and seasonalities in returns. (See Thaler (1987)\nand Haugen and Lakonishok (1988) for surveys of this literature.)\n3. The difference between the DAX30 (DAXINDZ) and its four-month\n(~ approximately 100 trading days) and eight-month (~ approximately 200\ntrading days) backward-looking moving averages (DMA100; DMA200).\nWe considered DMA100 and DMA200 as predictors for stock market\nvolatility because simple moving-average-based trading strategies have\nbeen studied extensively in the literature on technical trading rules (Brock\n4. The IFO overall business climate indicator (IFO; WGIFOMXLE). Jacobs\nand Sturm (2004) have reported that IFO contains information with regard\nto revisions of German macroeconomic data. In consequence, it could\nhave been valuable for investors who must rely on preliminary real-time\nmacroeconomic data to include IFO in the information set they used to\nforecast stock market volatility. Moreover, in contrast to industrial\nproduction and orders inflow, there have been no irregularities with\nrespect to the publication of the IFO index.\n5. The level of the VDAX-NEW index. We used the VDAX-NEW index as a\nregressor to take into account that volatility may follow a mean-reverting\nprocess.\n4. Results\nIn Table 2, we summarize how often the macroeconomic and other variables are\nselected by our recursive modeling approach as regressors under different model\nselection criteria. In the second column, we report results for models that use revised\nmacroeconomic data as potential regressors. In the third column, we report results for\nmodels that use real-time macroeconomic data as potential regressors. As one would\nhave expected, an investor who relied upon the BIC criterion would have used only few\nregressors to forecast stock market volatility. Moreover, irrespective of the model\nselection criterion considered, an investor would have chosen almost always the\nVDAX-NEW index as a regressor.\nTable 2  Inclusion of Variables (in percent)\nRevised data Real-time data\nIndustrial production (month-to-month changes)\nOrders inflow (month-to-month changes)\nOutput gap\nNote: For definitions of variables, see Section 3. ACD denotes the Adjusted Coefficient of Determination,\nAIC denotes the Akaike Information Criterion, and BIC denotes the Bayesian Information Criterion.\nBy contrast, the investor's choice of the other regressors would have been highly\ndependent on the model selection criteria applied to select a forecasting model. As\nconcerns the macroeconomic data, the investor would have selected the inflation rate\nmore often as a regressor than either industrial production, orders inflow, or the output\ngap. Finally, there is no general tendency that an investor would have included real-time\nmacroeconomic data more often in the optimal forecasting model than revised\nmacroeconomic data, and vice versa.\nIn order to analyze the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility based on real-\ntime and revised macroeconomic data, we report in Panel A of Table 3 for each model\nthe RMSE. In Panel B, we document results for the U statistic. A comparison of the\nRMSEs shows that no clear ranking of models is apparent. In fact, the results for the U\nstatistic reveal that forecasting models based on real-time macroeconomic data work as\nwell as forecasting models based on revised macroeconomic data. This suggests that\npreliminary real-time macroeconomic data are as (un-)informative with regard to stock\nmarket volatility as are revised macroeconomic data. In other words, an investor who\nmust rely on real-time macroeconomic data to forecast stock market volatility would\nhave done not worse than an investor who had access to revised macroeconomic data to\nforecast stock market volatility. Given the large attention that financial market\nparticipants and the mass media often pay to data revisions this result is somewhat\nsurprising.\nTable 3 -- RMSE and U Statistic\nPANEL A: Root mean squared error statistics\nRevised data Real-time data\nIndustrial production (month-to-month changes)\nOrders inflow (month-to-month changes)\nOutput gap\nPANEL B: U statistic\nIndustrial production\nOrders inflow\nOutput gap\nNote: ACD denotes the Adjusted Coefficient of Determination, AIC denotes the Akaike Information\nCriterion, and BIC denotes the Bayesian Information Criterion.\nBecause statistical measures of forecasting ability may not be closely related to\nforecasts' profits (Leitch and Tanner 1991), we analyzed a utility-based criterion to\nstudy the implications of using real-time and revised macroeconomic data for\nforecasting stock market volatility. In Table 4, we report in Panel A for each model\naverage utility as defined in (7). In Panel B, we report the wealth-sacrifice ratios one\nobtains by comparing average utility of forecasting models based on real-time (revised)\nmacroeconomic data with average utility of the other forecasting models based on real-\ntime (revised) macroeconomic data. In Panel C, we report the wealth-sacrifice ratios one\nobtains by comparing average utility of forecasting models based on real-time\nmacroeconomic data with average utility of forecasting models based on revised\nmacroeconomic data. The better forecasting model has a wealth-sacrifice ratio of zero.\nIn order to assess the robustness of our results, we report results for coefficients of\nrelative risk aversion of 1\n=\n=\n .\nTable 4  Utility-Based Criterion\nPANEL A: Average utility\nRevised data Real-time data\nIndustrial production (month-to-month changes)\nOrders inflow (month-to-month changes)\nOutput gap\nTable 4, continued.\nPANEL B: Wealth-sacrifice ratio\n(revised data vs. revised data; real-time data vs. real-time data)\nRevised data Real-time data\nIndustrial production (month-to-month changes)\nOrders inflow (month-to-month changes)\nOutput gap\nPANEL C: Wealth-sacrifice ratio\n(revised data vs. real-time data)\nRevised Real-time Revised Real-time\nIndustrial production (month-to-month changes)\nOrders inflow (month-to-month changes)\nOutput gap\nNote:  denotes the coefficient of risk aversion. ACD denotes the Adjusted Coefficient of\nDetermination, AIC denotes the Akaike Information Criterion, and BIC denotes the Bayesian Information\nCriterion.\nAs regards the optimal model selection criterion, the results summarized in Table\n4 show that an investor who had used the BIC model selection criterion would have\nreaped the highest average utility. In contrast, an investor who had used the ACD model\nselection criterion would have reaped the lowest average utility. This ranking of model\nselection criteria is indifferent to the calibration of the coefficient of relative risk\naversion. As regards forecasting models based on real-time and revised macroeconomic\ndata, no clear-cut ranking is possible. Under the ACD and the AIC model selection\ncriteria, forecasting models based on revised macroeconomic data outperform models\nbased on real-time macroeconomic data. In contrast, under the BIC model selection\ncriterion, in terms of the wealth-sacrifice ratios, the forecasting models based on real-\ntime macroeconomic data are better than the forecasting models based on revised\nmacroeconomic data. However, the differences between models are small because,\nunder the BIC criterion, macroeconomic variables are included only occasionally in the\noptimal forecasting model. All in all, we conclude that an investor who uses our utility-\nbased criterion to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility should\nuse the BIC criterion to select a forecasting model for two reasons. First, choosing the\nBIC criterion maximizes average utility. Second, the BIC criterion helps the investor to\nminimize the negative impact on average utility that results from the fact that the\ninvestor must use preliminary real-time rather than reliable revised macroeconomic data\nfor forecasting stock market volatility in real time.\nFinally, we report results for our options-based criterion of the accuracy of\nforecasts of stock market volatility. In Table 5, we report cumulative profits, the\nstandard deviation of cumulative profits, and standardized profits that an investor would\nhave realized who had traded straddles in our synthetic options-market. We computed\nstandardized profits as the ratio of cumulative profits and their standard deviation.\nProfits do not add up to zero because both traders are short in straddles if their forecasts\nof stock market volatility are identical. Columns 2-4 summarize results for revised\nmacroeconomic data, and Columns 5-7 summarize results for real-time macroeconomic\ndata.\nCorroborating the results for the statistical and utility-based criteria, the options-\nbased criterion does not clearly favor forecasting models based on real-time over\nforecasting models based on revised macroeconomic data. Thus, in terms of our\noptions-based criterion, the accuracy of an investor's volatility forecasts does not\nchange much when reliable revised rather than noisy real-time macroeconomic data are\navailable for forecasting stock market volatility. Interestingly, however, the standard\ndeviation of cumulative profits is always relatively small when forecasts of stock\nmarket volatility are based on revised macroeconomic data. Thus, when trading options\nbased on volatility forecasts derived from revised macroeconomic data, an investor runs\nthe danger of underestimating the standard deviation of profits. If only forecasting\nmodels based on real-time data are considered, it is clear from the results given in Table\n5 that, as was the case with the utility-based criterion, the BIC model selection criterion\nperforms very well.\nTable 5  Options-Based Criterion\nRevised data Real-time data\nIndustrial production (month-to-month changes)\nProfits SD Profits/SD Profits SD Profits/SD\nOrders inflow (month-to-month changes)\nProfits SD Profits/SD Profits SD Profits/SD\nOutput gap\nProfits SD Profits/SD Profits SD Profits/SD\nNote: ACD denotes the Adjusted Coefficient of Determination, AIC denotes the Akaike Information\nCriterion, and BIC denotes the Bayesian Information Criterion.\n5. Conclusion\nIn real time, an investor faces the problem that only preliminary real-time\nmacroeconomic data are available for forecasting stock market volatility. The result of\nour empirical research using German real-time macroeconomic data may provide some\nguidelines for investors for how to deal with this problem. Our main result is that the\nstatistical and economic value of forecasts of stock market volatility based on real-time\ndata is comparable to the value of forecasts based on revised macroeconomic data. This\nresult has two implications. For investors who act in real time, our result implies that\nthey can safely use real-time macroeconomic data to forecast stock market volatility.\nFor researchers who ex post analyze macroeconomic and financial data, our result\nimplies that they can employ revised macroeconomic data to study the equilibrium\nrelations between macroeconomic variables and stock market volatility. Of course,\nbefore our result can be generalized, much more research has to be done. For example,\nit would be interesting to use data for other countries and periods of time to study\nfurther the macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility in real time.\nReferences\nAkaike, H.
