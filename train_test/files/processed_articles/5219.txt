    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe article focuses on group-based features of issue publics and advances the concept of residual group saliency as a\nway to organize members of issue publics. We accord veterans exemplar or prototype status, and civilians as periphery\nmembers of this issue public. As issue public exemplars, veterans anchor the \"right\" attitudes and behaviors for the\nveteran issue public, and civilians, especially those with family ties to veterans, gravitate toward those exemplar attitudes.\nWe argue that pressure to conform to these \"right\" attitudes among civilians who are connected to a veteran is greater\nwhen there are more veterans in their environment. However, veterans and civilians who are not connected to a\nveteran are not responsive to such contextual effects, the former because they are already exemplars, and the latter\nbecause there is no motivation to evaluate the self in relation to veterans. We test and find support for these claims\nusing data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We conclude with an evaluative discussion and\nsuggestions for future research.\n",

We conclude\nby discussing the implications of our findings for future\nresearch.\nThe group component of issue publics\nThe core thesis of the issue public concept is that people\nvary in the personal importance that they attach to their\nHowever, for issue publics to form in the first place, the\nimportance attached to a particular issue must be shared\nwith others. The central premise of this study is that issue\nimportance is shared, and sharing renders issue publics\nsubject to group dynamics.\nGroups play a central role in the study of attitude forma-\ntion and political behavior (Campbell, et al. 1960). They\nmediate our complex social environments by helping us\nsort more from less relevant facts, and they orient our inter-\nests in policy and candidate judgments. Thus, when we\nidentify strongly with a group, we attach greater impor-\ntance to issues that we believe may impact the status of that\ngroup (Key, 1961). Whether salience is activated because\nour group is in the political spotlight, or because fellow\ngroup members are highly concentrated in our local envi-\nronment (Lau, 1989), groups are heuristics that help us as\nconsumers of political information and practitioners of\ncivic engagement.\nThe influential social identification model of group\nbehavior, along with a self-categorization variant, guides\nour work here (Huddy, 2012). This approach posits that cat-\negorization is key to understanding group-driven behavior\nindividuals are motivated to be seen favorably, and hence\nintergroup relations are competitions for positive identity.\nOne powerful insight uncovered by this model is that, even\nabsent face-to-face contact and a common purpose, the\nmere perception of belonging to a group is sufficient to\ninduce differential group member/non-member behavior\nMany other insights have been produced by the social\nidentity and self-categorization approach. Two are worth\nunderscoring here. First, group identification is distinct\nfrom group membership. The mere presence or absence of\ncharacteristics that determine objective membership, such\nas job status, race, and sex, need not be accompanied by a\nconcept of residual group saliency builds from the inverse:\nan individual need not be an objective member of a group\nin order to express attitudes consistent with the group--\nthey need only feel a sense of closeness to the group or its\nmembers.\nSecond, later advances in social identity theory have\nemphasized the role of prototype group members in struc-\nturing intra-group dynamics. According to Hogg (2001:\n187), prototypes are abstractions based on \"fuzzy sets of\nattributes that define and prescribe attitudes, feelings, and\nbehaviors that characterize one group and distinguish it\nfrom other groups.\" Individuals use prototypes as exemplars\nto assess themselves and others by the extent to which they\nembody prototype attributes (Hogg and Hains, 1996). As\ntion gradient\" governs in-group favoritism and out-group\nantipathy, as well as more or less liking of in-group mem-\nbers. The implication for policy attitude formation in issue\npublics is that prototypes find expression as leaders who\nanchor the \"correct\" attitude, while followers seeking to\nmaximize similarity between self and prototype, conform.\nPolitical science does boast behavior models that empha-\nless knowledge and interest in politics are willingly influ-\nenced by opinion leaders. In models of political mobiliza-\ntion, Uhlaner (1989) contends that \"relational goods\"\nincentivize individuals to behave rationally in group con-\ntexts. For Uhlaner, individuals are embedded in social envi-\nronments, which include leaders who turn to loyalty appeals\nto persuade group members because internal cohesion trans-\nThe claim here is that issue publics, like groups in gen-\neral, have leaders and followers. The \"core\" of issue pub-\nlics are opinion leaders who exemplify the prototypical\nattitude, and have incentive to \"expand the scope of con-\nflict\" (Schattschneider, 1960). Furthermore, periphery\nmembers of issue publics have incentive to conform to atti-\ntudes expressed by core members, and leader influence can\nextend to objective non-members who nonetheless main-\ntain closeness to core group members in issue publics. Just\nas group salience and social density prods objective group\nmembers to identify with a group (i.e. Lau, 1989), so can\nthese forces extend to residual issue public members. The\nmore core members in the local environment, the greater\nthe incentive for periphery members of issue publics to\nconform. The policy attitudes of issue public \"core\" mem-\nbers and those without primary social connections to \"core\"\nmembers, however, should not respond to such contextual\nfactors, and hence neither are candidates for expanding the\nissue public. The former set of individuals is immune\nbecause they are already \"core\" members, while the latter\nset feels no pressure to evaluate the self against a prototype\nthat is not salient from their perspective.\nOur theory is consistent with this aspect of their theory:\nresidual group saliency is compatible with the primacy of\nattitude importance stipulated for the issue public construct.\nIssue publics may have reference group antecedents\ngroup membership. Political issues and politics need not\nmap perfectly to social group cleavages. Although the idea\nthat social context partially determines political attitudes is\nnot new (Huckfeldt, 1984), the study here explicitly links\ncontext, social identity theory, and issue publics.\nKrueger and Pedraza 3\nNext, we evaluate how family ties and the density of\n\"core\" issue public members in the local environment bind\nthe core and residual segments of the veteran issue public\ntogether. We select the veteran issue public for analysis, in\npart, because foreign policy remains stereotyped as an issue\nthat is not on most people's radar (Almond, 1950; Converse,\n1964). Second, we are also keen to stimulate conversation\nbetween literatures on the civil-military gap (Lau et al.,\nSegura, 1998) and issue public approaches that engage for-\neign policy attitudes (Anand and Krosnick, 2003; Claassen\nand Nicholson, 2013). Our effort to bridge these literatures\nbegins with the concept of residual group saliency, a small,\nbut critical step towards theorizing how issue publics might\nexpand, contract, and maintain cohesion.\nMethods\nWe analyze individual-level survey data from the pre-elec-\ntion wave of the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election\nStudy. The survey includes 55,400 respondents, with repre-\nsentative samples of all 435 Congressional Districts. We\nuse a dichotomous measure of support for the Iraq War as\nour dependent variable. Logistic regression models control\nfor known correlates of war support, including local war\ncasualties, respondent partisanship, income, education,\nage, and sex.\nPredictors of interest are respondents' connections to\nveterans, congressional district veteran population density,\nand their interaction. Respondents are categorized for anal-\nysis in two ways. The first model estimates support for the\nIraq War by comparing veterans to civilians. This model\nrepresents approaches that assume only objective group\nmembers are influenced by salience-increasing contextual\nvariables. The second model broadens the scope of poten-\ntial issue public members by comparing veterans, civilians\nwith veterans in their immediate family, and civilians with-\nout a familial connection to veterans. This approach tests\nthe idea that civilians living with veterans respond to con-\ntextual cues that increase the salience of the veteran issue\npublic, not because the cues activate a veteran identity, but\nrather because they activate a residual form of that identity,\nwhich in turn can expand an issue public.\nOur contextual measure of group saliency is the propor-\ntion of the population that claims veteran status in the\nrespondent's congressional district; we draw the measure\nfrom the 2009 American Community Survey. The distribu-\ntion of the veteran density variable is approximately nor-\n2.1%). We expect that higher values on this index will\nincrease the salience of veterans for all civilian respond-\nents, represented as an interaction term, Veteran X Vet\nDensity. The more \"core\" members of the veteran issue\npublic in the social context, the more pressure to conform\nto the prototypical attitude of the veteran issue public.\nHowever, not all civilian respondents are equally embed-\nded in the veteran social context. Respondents related to\nveterans will be more strongly influenced by the density of\n\"prototypes\" in their context than civilians without the\nfamily connection. Evidence of this pattern would extend\nexisting literature on the relationship between group mem-\nbership and contextual effects. We capture that possibility\nwith a pair of interaction terms in the statistical model: one\nfor military-connected civilians (Vet connected civilian X\nVet density), and another for civilians who are not con-\nnected to a military service member (Unconnected civilian\nX Vet density). In both cases, the baseline comparison\ngroup is veteran respondents.\nFindings\nThe analysis begins by estimating the effect of veteran den-\nsity on respondent attitudes that the War in Iraq was not a\nmistake. Model 1 in Table 1 indicates that veterans are dis-\ntinct from non-veterans in their belief that the War in Iraq\ntiplicative interaction specified in the model is also statisti-\nmeans that veterans are more likely than non-veterans to\nexpress such a view at the lowest values of our measure of\nveteran density. Just how different are veterans from non-\nveterans across the full range of veteran density?\nFigure 1 traces predicted probabilities culled from\nModel 1, and captures the overall low popularity of the War\nin Iraq among Americans by 2010. At the lowest values of\nveteran density the figure illustrates a probability of about\n30% that veterans express support for the war (Iraq was not\na mistake), while non-veterans at 22% are less likely to do\nso. The 8-point difference between veterans and non-veter-\nans closes as the share of veterans in the local population\nincreases, suggesting expansion in the veteran issue public\non the matter of the War in Iraq. Importantly, it is move-\nment among non-veterans that closes this gap, a pattern\nconsistent with the theoretical model that specifies \"core\"\nissue public members as anchors, and residual group mem-\nbers as potential members whose attitudes gravitate toward\nthose expressed by the issue public prototype.\nWe further explore whether this relationship between\ncivilians and veteran density is driven by civilians who are\nconnected to veterans. We showcase this effort with Model\n2 in Table 1, which divides civilians into two groups--\nthose with familial ties to military service members and\nthose without--allowing the attitudes of each to be differ-\nentially influenced by veteran density as specified with\nseparate interaction terms. The model fit to data indicates\nthat relative to veterans, and at the lowest levels of veteran\ndensity, both connected and unconnected civilians are less\nlikely to say that the War in Iraq was a mistake. To illustrate\nthe magnitude of this difference and how it changes over\nthe full range of veteran density, we turn to Figure 2.\n4 Research and Politics \nLike predictions extracted from Model 1, those from\nModel 2 shown in Figure 2, indicate that veterans behave as\nattitudinal anchors when it comes to the War in Iraq. Unlike\nthe pattern observed in the first figure, however, this second\nfigure shows that movement toward \"prototype\" attitudes is\nonly among civilians with family ties to veterans. From the\nlowest to the highest observed values of veteran density, the\nveteran-connected in the sample are about 8 points more\nlikely to say that the War in Iraq was not a mistake (about\n23% to 31%). The difference relative to veterans across the\nfull range of veteran density values shifts from a -7 point\ndifference at the low end of veteran density, to a +2 point\ndifference in congressional districts with the highest\nproportion of veterans. While the 95% confidence bands\naround the estimates overlap at extreme values of veteran\ndensity, the model estimates clear moderating effects of\nveteran density for the attitudes of civilians connected to\nveterans. These residual issue public members respond to\nthe density of veterans in their surroundings, but their coun-\nterparts who are not connected to veterans--those without\nresidual group salience to activate--do not.\nAs Table 1 shows, these key patterns are observed con-\ntrolling a variety of known correlates of war attitudes. In\nthe third column we report the analysis of model uncer-\ntainty, a strategy for assessing the extent to which statisti-\ncal relationships are sensitive to model specification.\nTable 1. Estimates of Respondent Connection to Veterans and Veteran Density on Support for the Iraq War, 2010.\nIraq War not a mistake\nNote: *p<.01; **p<0.05; ***p<.001. The reference categories are Republicans (all models), civilians (model 1), and veterans (model 2). Constant\nestimated, but not reported. Data are from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study 2010 common content, except for veteran density which\nis from the American Community Survey 2009, and war casualties which is from public records.\nKrueger and Pedraza 5\nSpecifically, we use Bayesian Model Averaging as a tool\nto assess whether a variable contributes to the model's\nexplanatory power. Figures reported in column three cor-\nrespond to P(! = 0|Y), the posterior probability of models\nthat exclude the variable of interest (Hoeting et al., 1999).\nAs we might anticipate, partisan identity, sex, and various\nsocio-economic indicators carry the day as explanatory\nvariables of attitudes toward the Iraq War. War casualties\noffer little explanatory power, a finding that we address in\nmore detail below. However, the analysis also reveals pos-\nterior probabilities of 54% and 85% for the indicators of\nconnected civilians and unconnected civilians, respec-\ntively, as well as a 53% posterior probability for the inter-\nactive term. This is evidence that our selected specification\nis not \"cherry picked\" from a larger set of possible alter-\nnative specifications that leave out or include different\nvariables or sets of variables. The Bayesian Information\nCriterion score (BIC), which penalizes models with more\ncovariates, is lowered despite adding more variables. As a\ngeneral rule, BIC reductions between 10 and 100 are\n\"strong\" evidence against the null (Raftery, Madigan, and\nHoeting 1997), which here is the expectation that veteran\ndensity similarly effects veterans, veteran-connected\ncivilians, and unconnected civilians.\nOur interpretation of the analysis emphasizes group\ndynamics. However, the findings may reflect economic self-\ninterest. We account for this possibility with an indicator for\nthe 46% of sample respondents whose congressional district\ncontains a military base. The indicator distinguishes the\npresence of military bases from veteran density, and con-\ntrols the effect of supporting war because one's economic\nstatus is linked to military bases, like people who live or\nwork on base, or have business that depends on base popula-\ntion. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1 show that living in a dis-\ntrict with a base is positively associated with support for the\nWar in Iraq, but there is high model uncertainty about this\nresult as column three indicates (poster probability of 26%).\nAnalysis reported in the online supplement replicates Model\n2 using only the sample respondents whose congressional\ndistrict does not contain a military base. We find similar\nresults as those shown in Table 1 and Figure 2 (in fact,\nslightly stronger). Economic self-interest, measured through\nproxy of military base, has an independent association with\nsupport for the War in Iraq. However, even controlling this\nfactor, we still observe a differential moderating impact of\nveteran density for civilians connected to a veteran, not vet-\nerans themselves, whose economic fortunes, one presumes,\nwould be the most tied to war.\nEvaluative discussion\nThe preceding analysis has investigated attitudes toward\nthe War in Iraq in 2010. We argued that issue publics can be\nthought of as groups. These issue publics consist of leaders\nand followers, or \"core\" and \"periphery\" members. The\nresidual group saliency argument is that military veterans,\n\"core\" members of the veteran issue public, exemplify pro-\ntotypical attitudes, and residual group saliency activates a\npressure to conform to prototypical attitudes among civil-\nians with family ties to veterans. This effect is greater\nwhere there are more \"core\" members, but does not register\nfor those civilians without a family tie to the military. Issue\npublics can grow, but the source of that growth is more\navailable from some segments of the public than others.\nVet Density\nPr(Iraq Not a mistake)\nVete\nV\nV ran\nCivilian\nLogit estimates:\ninterval is shaded\nFigure 1.

Predicted probabilities of support for the War in\nIraq by veteran status, connection, and population density.\n6 Research and Politics \nThe empirics we report are compatible with extant\nresearch on support for war, including the general pattern of\ngreater support among veterans (Gartner, 2008; Mueller,\n1973), and that social ties to veterans typically translates\ninto greater support for war (Gartner, 2008; Lau et al.,\n1978). The qualified exception is that we find no statistical\nassociation between the number of war casualties and the\nview that the War in Iraq was not a mistake. This appears\ncontrary to research that shows casualties are a major factor\nin determining public support for war (Gartner and Segura,\n(1998) point out, the impact of casualties is temporally\nstructured, such that deaths occurring closer to the point of\nwar initiation are weighted more than those nearer to the\nclose of war. The combined temporal proximity of the\nthe 2007 surges in Iraq War casualties mitigated the differ-\nential local effect of casualties.\nBy the time data from the survey that we analyze were\ncollected, foreign policy issues were eclipsed on the\nnational agenda by domestic concerns. However, just\nbecause an issue falls off the public agenda does not mean\nthat its issue public disappears. That is the point of the issue\npublic concept; for some Americans an issue remains\nimportant, regardless of its rise and fall on the public\nagenda. The study here suggests that even when the many\nare not attentive to an issue, the issue public itself, though\nthey may be few, can generate issue public expansion.\nThis insight motivates further engagement with existing\nlines of inquiry. For example, we might further reconcile the\nfindings here with research on casualties and support for\nwar by replicating our analysis at the start and at the mid-\npoint of the War in Iraq. For scholars of the civil-military\ngap, residual group saliency suggests that the division\nbetween veterans and the rest of the public need not be so\nstark. The concepts of prototype and periphery might help\norganize investigations of other attitudes and behaviors\nwithin and between veterans and their civilian counterparts.\nFruitful synthesis might also be achieved with research that\nexplores social network ties to war casualties as determi-\nnants of war attitudes and vote choice (e.g. Gartner, 2010).\nJust as a \"prototype-based social attraction gradient\" gov-\nerns in-group favoritism and out-group antipathy (Hogg,\ntures war-related attitudes and behaviors (e.g. distinction by\nfamily, friend, co-worker or neighbor). Finally, is there an\nanalogous \"strength of weak ties\" pattern (Granovetter,\n1973) to issue public attitude formation and political behav-\nior influences, in general? These questions are clearly\nbeyond the scope of this study, but ones that are relevant to\nunderstanding issue publics and political behavior more\ngenerally. Whichever line of inquiry is further developed in\nresearch about issue publics, scholars benefit from the new\ntheoretical and empirical grounds about the structure and\ndynamics of issue publics that our analysis provides.\n"
