Adolescent exposure to violence and school social\nenvironment was measured in 1994 and 1995 when participants were in high school or mid-\ndle school.

Approximately one-in-three women and one-in-four men in the United States report\nexperiencing physical or sexual IPV.[1] Much of the IPV literature focuses on victimization\nand the limited research on perpetrators, especially studies using longitudinal designs, has\nhampered efforts to develop and implement effective interventions for IPV perpetration.[2\u00ad4]\nLiterature suggests the etiology of IPV perpetration is multifactorial.[3] Static antecedents,\nstable characteristics that a relatively resistant to modification, are frequently studied as con-\ntributors to IPV perpetration. A recent systematic review found that demographic characteris-\ntics, including age, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and marital status, and other static\nantecedents, including mental health/illness and personality, are significant predictors of IPV\nperpetration.[4] Distal antecedents, characteristics that are temporally removed from the time\nof perpetration but may indirectly contribute to behavior, have also been evaluated as potential\ncontributors to IPV perpetration. Exposure to violence in the family of origin has been studied\nextensively and has consistently been shown to be associated with increased risk for adulthood\nIPV perpetration.[4, 5] Risky adolescent behaviors, including substance use and engaging with\ndeviant peers, has also been associated with adulthood IPV perpetration.[5] Proximal anteced-\nents, events or situations near the time of perpetration, may also contribute to IPV perpetra-\ntion. Community factors, such as collective efficacy or social control, interpersonal factors,\nsuch as relationship discord or deviant peers, and individual factors, such as substance abuse,\nmay also directly contribute to perpetration.[3, 4]\nMultiple etiological frameworks have been developed to explain why IPV perpetration\noccurs.[3, 6] However, the contributions of genetic factors have generally not been considered\nin these frameworks, despite research supporting genetic contributions to other forms of\naggression.[7, 8] To our knowledge, three studies have examined genetic contributions to IPV\nperpetration,[9\u00ad11] including only one that examined specific genes.[11] In that study, some\nvariants of the Monoamine Oxidase A gene and the serotonin transporter gene were associated\nwith increased odds of more frequent perpetration of IPV.[11] In light of the significant con-\ntributions of gene by environment interactions to other forms of aggression perpetration, the\ndearth of research on these interactions and IPV perpetration may be a significant limitation\nto knowledge of the etiology of IPV. To address this gap in the literature, the purpose of this\nanalysis was to conduct a gene by environment analysis of three dopamine genes and two com-\nponents of the social environment during adolescence to predict physical IPV perpetration\namong adults. Although genetic contributions are, at this point not modifiable, understanding\nGene by environment interaction to predict IPV\nFunding: LMSR, EAP, and CPA received pilot\nfunding from the University of Iowa Injury\nPrevention Research Center for this project.
