The vast majority of CYSHCN treated at the Center during this study ranged\nin age from 6 to 12 years. Of those children, 82% had public insurance, 17% required home-nursing services, 24% required\nmobility aids, and 16% required enteral nutritional/feeding tubes. The most common diagnoses included developmental delay,\nintellectual disability, and cerebral palsy.

As elucidated by Newacheck et al. (1998), the\nMaternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) identifies chil-\ndren and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) as\nthose with a \"chronic physical, developmental, behavioral or\nemotional condition\" who require \"health and related ser-\nvices of a type or amount beyond that required by children\ngenerally.\" According to Liptak et al. (2006) and Damiano,\nMomany, Tyler, Penziner, and Lobas (2006), Medical care\nfor CYSHCN represents a portion of the top 10% of health\ncare costs among children, which in turn accounts for 54% of\nall pediatric health care costs. Yet, in many ways, the social\nand emotional challenges associated with the care of\nCYSHCN are of paramount concern; the issues CYSHCN\nand their families face are at times complex and overwhelm-\ning. As a result, patients with chronic conditions can foster\ntime-intensive primary care visits.\nStrickland et al. (2004) define the medical home as a\nframework of health care delivery designed to improve the\nquality of care received by this vulnerable subset of children.\nIn many ways, this model is the highest standard of care for\nCYSHCN, incorporating elements of care coordination,\nfamily-centered care, and comprehensive health assessments\n(Sia et al., 2004). First introduced by the American Academy\nof Pediatrics (AAP) in 1967 as a central repository for chil-\ndren's medical records, the medical home has evolved over\ntime, and its core tenets are contained in the Affordable Care\nAct (American Academy of Pediatrics, Council on Pediatric\nPractice, 1967; Patient Protection and Affordable CareAct of\nIn a 2007 joint statement by both pediatric and adult\nphysicians, seven core principles of a patient-centered\nmedical home (PC-MH) were identified (AmericanAcademy\nof Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics,\n1St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n2School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n3Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, USA\n4Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRenee M.

According to this statement, a PC-MH\nincludes (a) a personal physician, (b) a physician-directed\npractice team, (c) care addressing all life stages, (d) care\ncoordination across multiple systems, (e) appropriate pay-\nment, (f) safe, high-quality care, and (g) enhanced access to\ncomprehensive care.\nWhile chronic condition management is more often\ndescribed in the adult literature, it is paramount to acknowl-\nedge that the pediatric and adult medical home landscapes\nboth converge and diverge in their delivery models (Wagner\nguish the pediatric from the adult medical home. They\ninclude (a) developmental trajectory, (b) dependency on\nadults, (c) differential epidemiology of chronic disease, (d)\ndemographic patterns of poverty and diversity, and (e) over-\nall dollars spent on children versus adults. The pediatric\nmedical home has a long history, and recent literature sug-\ngests that this model of care delivery has a favorable impact\non patient outcomes, health care utilization, and family-cen-\ntered care (Advisory Committee, American Academy of\nPediatrics' Medical Home Initiative for Children With\nSpecial Health Care Needs, 2002; American Academy of\nPediatrics, Council on Pediatric Practice, 1967; Cooley,\nMcAllister, Presler, Turchi, & Antonelli, 2009; McAllister,\nSherrieb, & Cooley, 2009). The goal of this article is to elab-\norate on the merits and achievements of a pediatric medical\nhome in clinical practice.\nStudies suggest that care delivered in the context of a pedi-\natric medical home has resulted in fewer emergency depart-\nment (ED) visits and hospitalizations while bolstering quality\nof care and provider satisfaction (Advisory Committee,\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics' Medical Home Initiative\nfor Children With Special Health Care Needs, 2002; Leff\nstudies have found that health systems constructed around\nprimary care yield more favorable outcomes while maintain-\ning lower expenditures (Grumbach & Bodenheimer, 2002;\nStarfield, Shi, & Macinko, 2005). Furthermore, improving\nthe experience of care for CYSHCN and their families pro-\nmulgates Berwick, Nolan, and Whittington's (2008) \"Triple\nAim\" for health care delivery. Berwick posits that providers\nshould strive to (a) improve the experience of care for patients,\n(b) improve the health of populations, and (c) reduce per cap-\nita costs of health care.\nProvision of care in a medical home varies between the\nprivate and public sectors, community and children's hospi-\ntals, and urban and rural regions. What is understood and\naccepted is that CYSHCN utilize resources and services at a\nhigher rate than other children/youth, often requiring more\ntime with primary care providers to maintain optimal health\n(Turchi, Gatto, & Antonelli, 2007). For example, according\nto Vogeli et al. (2007), patients with five or more chronic\nconditions may have encounters with up to 14 physicians in\none calendar year, thus warranting optimal care coordination\nand communication among providers.\nThe Medical Home in One Urban Children's\nHospital\nPrimary care for CYSHCN may be delivered in a variety of\nsettings, including private practices, hospital-based clinics,\ncommunity health centers, and practices based in children's\nhospitals. According to the Children's Hospital Association\nhospitals, 152 children's hospitals within a general hospital,\nand 19 specialty children's hospitals in the United States\noffering comprehensive care for children. There is a paucity\nof literature describing the experiences of CYSHCN and\nfamilies receiving care in children's hospital-based clinics.\nOften, parents/caregivers of CYSHCN seek primary and spe-\ncialty care for their children at children's hospitals if geo-\ngraphically convenient. Some families with CYSHCN\n(particularly in rural sectors) are located far from tertiary\ncare centers and rely on hospital-based medical homes to\nreceive coordinated and comprehensive care. As such, it is\ncritical to explore models of primary care delivery for this\nfragile pediatric population in a children's hospital setting.\nThis article seeks to describe the experience of a primary\ncare practice for CYSHCN located within an urban chil-\ndren's hospital.\nThe Center for CYSHCN at St. Christopher's Hospital for\nChildren in Philadelphia (an urban health care center) was\nconceived by primary care physicians and staff who partici-\npated in a statewide medical home initiative (www.pamedic-\nalhome.org). The Center for CYSHCN was founded in 2003\nwith a stated mission to provide ongoing, comprehensive,\nand family-centered medical care to CYSHCN and their\nfamilies and to improve access to services, community\nresources, and advocacy. It is the Center's objective to foster\nopportunities for children to obtain optimal support through\nlife stages and achieve independence. Our study evaluated\nthe Center's medical home implementation over the course\nof several years.\nBackground\nCenter Practices\nThe Center for CYSHCN branched off from a larger pri-\nmary care pediatric practice to focus on the provision of\ncomprehensive and coordinated primary care services for\nCYSHCN and their families. With an initial staff of two\npediatricians, a nurse care coordinator, and a population of\nCYSHCN and their siblings with a team of five pediatri-\ncians, one nurse practitioner, three nurse care coordinators,\ntwo social workers, a health navigator, and four administra-\ntive personnel.\nTurchi et al. 3\nThe Center for CYSHCN embraces the medical home\nmodel of care delivery, in which practice-based care coordi-\nnation plays a central role. In a 2007 Pediatrics article on the\nbenefits of practice-wide care coordination, McAllister et al.\nidentify a method for implementing a model in which team\nmembers outline a \"vision for care, a framework of struc-\ntures and processes, and a position description with specific\ncompetencies.\" The goal of this first step is to test the prac-\ntice's service capacity while integrating and evaluating care\ncoordination services. Wagner's Chronic Care Medical\nHome Model (CCM) is used as a framework at the Center.\nThis model emphasizes the importance of community\nresources that serve CYSHCN and their families (Epping-\nJordan, Pruitt, Bengoa, & Wagner, 2004). In addition, the\nCCM advocates family-centered care in which proactive\ncare teams are omnipresent during all aspects of care\ndelivery.\nAt the Center for CYSHCN, the entire practice team is\ninvolved in coordinating care for patients with special health\ncare needs. The unique aspects of each role (from front desk\nattendant to physician) cannot be underestimated, and all\nteam members are vital in interfacing with the patient and\nfamily (Grumbach & Bodenheimer, 2004).Acrucial member\nof the Center's medical home team is the practice care coor-\ndinator, whose role includes developing medical summaries\nand care plans, promoting patient counseling about medical\nand educational services, and increasing access to commu-\nnity resources (Gupta, O'Connor, & Quezada-Gomez, 2004;\nMcAllister, Presler, et al., 2009). The care coordinator works\nwith families during hospitalization, transition from hospital\nto home, outpatient specialist appointments, and home visits.\nThe coordinator participates in interdisciplinary meetings\nwith home-nursing agencies and equipment companies,\nand also connects families to resources (such as Early\nIntervention) and attends Individualized Education Plan\nmeetings. These diverse responsibilities emulate the AAP's\nvision for care coordination as crossing multiple systems and\nservices (Council on Children With Disabilities, 2005).\nMethod\nData Collection and Statistical Analysis\nData collection and analysis is integral to the growth and\nquality improvement at the Center. The care coordinator con-\nducts rigorous data collection on resources and health care\nutilization from the first day that a patient is seen at the\nCenter. In examining data distribution, frequency and per-\ncentages of the variables were displayed, and the mean of\nthe Medical Home Index scores for varying services was\nplotted over the course of 3 years (Cooley, McAllister,\nSherrieb, & Clark, 2003). The distribution of the overall\nburden due to referrals, communication tools, admission,\nand emergency visits were assessed over a 6-year period\nyear as a risk factor was fitted to assess the significant dif-\nference in rates and to test the linear trend(s) over the desig-\nnated years. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess\nthe difference in diagnostic severity levels between the\nCenter's CYSHCN population and patients in other medical\nhome practices across Pennsylvania. The above analyses\ncollection efforts for this work were reviewed and approved\nby the Drexel University College of Medicine's Institutional\nReview Board.\nResults\nPatient Population\nTable 1 shows that the Center's patient population has\nincreased steadily since its inception. The majority of the\nCenter's patients are publicly insured. In addition, the\nCenter serves a disproportionate number of children who are\nTable 1.

Initially, a comprehensive patient data-\nbase was developed including the patient's name, date of\nbirth, diagnoses, insurance, race, home nursing and equip-\nment needs, and a medically determined severity score. This\nseverity score calculation is based on the Phoenix Severity\nScoring system developed by Dr. David Hirsch (2001). This\nsystem allows practitioners to score the severity of a patient's\nmedical condition(s) (1 being the least severe and 4 being the\nmost severe) on organ system involvement and psychosocial\nissues (designated by an \"S\" after the numeric score).\nAs shown in Figure 1, the percentage of CYSHCN with\nseverity scores greater than 2 was statistically significantly\nhigher in the Center when compared with other primary care\npediatric practices involved in the PA MHI across the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania who do not exclusively\ntreat CYSHCN.\nReferrals, Care Plans, and Hospitalizations\nMany elements of health care utilization were examined over\nthe course of the study. Staff tracked referrals to specialists\nand the number of procedures received by the Center's popu-\nlation and saw that both increased in absolute numbers with\ntime. As the Center's patient population expanded over a\n6-year span, so too did the utilization of care coordination\ndocuments and materials such as patient care plans and fam-\nily-collaborative medical summaries. As shown in Figure 2,\nthe number of referrals to community resources and mental\nhealth providers experienced initial growth before decreas-\nFigure 3 tracks the number of hospitalizations and ED\nvisits for CYSHCN cared for at the Center. Again, there is a\nsteady increase of hospitalizations and visits between 2004\nand 2010 that mirrors the increase of the patient cohort at the\nCenter.\nThe Medical Home Index\nThe Medical Home Index was completed by all staff mem-\nbers in an effort to effectively measure quality improvement\naround medical home constructs. Initial index completion\nprovides a \"needs assessment of medical homeness\" of a\npractice (Cooley et al., 2003). The index also affords primary\ncare practices the opportunity to evaluate discrete domains to\nfocus on and the ability to monitor progress. The Center\ndemonstrated statistically significant increases in index\nscores over time. Results are shown in Figure 4.\nCare Coordination\nThe Center for CYSHCN tracked individual care coordina-\ntion encounters for patients over a 24-month period. More\nthan 18,000 care coordination encounters were tracked, rep-\nresenting multiple care coordination events for some patients.\nWe found that 76% of all care coordination encounters con-\nsisted of time spent with nurse coordinators, while the least\namount of time (1%) occurred with the treating physician.\nSee Figure 5 for results.\nDiscussion\nFigure 1 demonstrates that patients at the Center are over three\ntimes more likely to have severity scores of 2 or higher than\nCYSHCN in other PA MHI practices. It can be assumed that\nthe Center's patient population shows a higher rate of medical\ncomplexity due to the practice's focus on primary care provi-\nsion for CYSHCN through referrals. Regardless of the etiol-\nogy of this disparity in scores, it highlights the complexity of\npatients in this practice. Linking severity of diagnosis to time\nspent on care coordination may help primary care practices\ndetermine the appropriate allocation of resources, as well as\nallotment of staff hours, roles, and responsibilities. It would be\nworthwhile to corroborate this trend with other care maps and\nscoring systems in an attempt to predict the levels of services\nthat CYSHCN with particular diagnoses/severity scores\nmight require.\nIn a study conducted at the Special Primary Care Clinic\n(SPCC) at the Children's Hospital of Denver, researchers\nPercentage of Children\nSeverity Score\nPA\nCenter for CYSHCN\nSeverity\nScore PA Center for CYSHCN\nFigure 1.

As mentioned previously, the overall number of\npatients enrolled at the Center increased steadily over time.\nThe study identified an intriguing trend among ED visits and\nhospitalizations over time. There was a statistically signifi-\ncant increase in ED visits over a 6-year period. For hospital-\nizations, there was a peak in 2009 followed by a decrease in\n2010. One explanation for this finding is that by the final\nyear of the observation, care coordination at the Center was\ninstitutionalized to such a degree that its multidisciplinary\nbenefits helped prevent unnecessary expenditures with\nrespect to unplanned hospitalizations. For example, some of\nthe CYSHCN with acute needs may have been appropriately\ntreated in the Center or at their specialist's office due to\nincreased access to care coordination services. This finding\nis limited in that patient diagnosis may be a confounder.\nMoreover, the data collected were not able to discern the\nlevel of ED visits (acute vs. routine) and planned versus\nunplanned hospitalizations. It is a finding that warrants\nfuture studies that follow the same patient(s) longitudinally\nto confirm our hypothesis in explaining this trend.\nIt is clear that there is a natural increase in the number of\nreferrals to specialists over time that mirrors the increase in\nthe absolute number of patients cared for at the Center. When\na child with special health care needs is first seen in any prac-\ntice, there is often an initial increase in service utilization and\nreferrals to community resources as the patient is connected\nwith support services to maintain and improve their func-\ntioning. This finding may also explain the plateau in com-\nmunity and mental health referrals as CYSHCN were\nroutinely linked to appropriate resources. Moreover, staff\nturnover and training may account for some decreases.\nThe Medical Home Index proved to be an important self-\nassessment tool. The Center demonstrated statistically sig-\nnificant increases in reported scores over time, which helped\ndefine measures of success and best practices for continued\nmedical home utilization. In addition, since community out-\nreach and quality improvement were two of the team's\nCare Plans+Medical\nSummaries/ Patients\nComm Resource Referral\n/patients\nRates per Year\nFigure 2. Center for CYSHCN referrals and communication tools.\nNote. Poisson regression analysis showed that all of the six rates decreased significantly (p < .001), the exception being Home Care that showed an\nincrease over the years (2004-2010). CYSHCN = children and youth with special health care needs; MH = medical home.\n6 SAGE Open\nlowest initial scores, the index fostered robust efforts to\nfocus on these areas. Assessment of the medical home prac-\ntice's increased efficacy over time is a useful exercise in\nmonitoring quality improvement, staff training, and practice\nThe practice team is a vital component of any medical\nhome. Defining the roles and responsibilities of all team\nmembers is paramount in fostering efficiency and optimal\ncommunication(Chenetal.,2010;Grumbach&Bodenheimer,\n2004). Among the Center's medical home team members, the\ncare coordinator spent the most time on care coordination\nactivities by an overwhelming margin. Having a designated\ncare coordinator certainly contributes to this finding. One sur-\nvey of pediatricians found that the two biggest barriers to pro-\nviding care coordination services were the physician's lack of\navailable time and an inadequate number of office staff or allo-\ncated hours (Gupta et al., 2004). \"Relational coordination\"--an\nemerging health care topic--may prove helpful in overcoming\nthese obstacles (McDonald et al., 2010). This level of care\ncoordination is defined as \"a mutually reinforcing process of\ninteraction between communication and relationships carried\nout for the purpose of task integration.\" Relational coordina-\ntion is particularly relevant to care coordination at the Center;\nthe care coordination \"activities\" were as important as the\nteam (i.e., families, community partners, physicians, nurses,\nAdmis-\nsions*\nAdmission\n/Patient\nED\nVisits*\nED Visit/\nPatient\nTotal\nCYSHCN\nCalender Year (n)\nRates\nFigure 3.

As outlined by\nMcAllister, Presler, and Cooley (2007), care planning\nincludes the use of an \"actionable\" care plan with assigned\ntasks/roles, a care plan document, emergency information\nform, and/or a medical summary including past medical his-\ntory and salient specialist information. Practices can use\ntools such as the Care Coordination Measures Atlas, devel-\noped by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality\n(McDonald et al., 2010). The Atlas provides a list of activi-\nties proposed as a means of achieving coordinated care that\nis organized by domains and perspectives (i.e., patient/fam-\nily, health care professional, system representative).\nConclusion\nAll children deserve a medical home. The subset of children\nwho have unique medical needs require care coordination\nand, at times, services in the setting of a children's hospital.\nAs stated by Palfrey et al. (1994), there are limited data on\nthe prevalence of CYSHCN who are extremely medically\nfragile (i.e., technology dependent). This small subset of\nchildren is the focus of the primary care service delivery in\nthis study. Data collection strategies in a hospital-based\nclinic may lend themselves to infrastructure and resource\nplanning.\nCare coordination has been shown to not be cost prohibi-\ntive in practice and essential in practice growth and the\nestablishment of a sustainable medical home model\n(Antonelli & Antonelli, 2004). Future studies of cost benefit\nanalyses of services rendered (i.e., care coordination) and\nhealth care utilization are warranted. Employing these data\nin reimbursement strategies for care coordination activities is\nan important next step.\nStudies suggest that care coordination favorably impacts\nfamily satisfaction while reducing barriers to care (Turchi\ncoordination services was not evaluated in this study, but it\nrepresents an area for future research. With the future of\nhealth care reform and accountable care organizations, data\nfrom hospital-based clinics and affiliates may become ple-\nthoric (Joint Principles for Accountable Care Organizations,\nFinally, as members of the medical community, we must\nprioritize care coordination as a \"critical and reimbursable\nelement of a medical home\" while \"creating rigorous, audit-\nable, and broadly applicable training programs\" (Turchi\net al., 2007). In this quest, we can address Berwick's \"Triple\nAim\" by partnering with patients and families to redesign\nprimary care, address population health management,\nachieve solvent financial management, and integrate the sys-\ntems of care for our patients (Berwick et al., 2008).\nTurchi et al. 7\nLimitations\nThe data from this study represent one children's hospital, and\nthus are not generalizable to all children's hospitals. However,\nthis study does contribute much-needed knowledge to a limited\narea of research. In addition, health care utilization analyses\nwere not controlled for diagnoses, severity of condition(s), or\nunplanned versus planned hospitalizations. These deficits rep-\nresent areas for future work and research. While the data were\ncollected and recorded by one staff person, recall bias is possi-\nble when considering individual care coordination encounters.\nFinally, the Medical Home Index scores reflect self-reporting\nfrom all staff in the Center. As a result, these data may over-\nor underestimate the level of care coordination activity at the\nCenter.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This work was\npresented at the American Academy of Pediatrics, Future of\nPediatrics Meeting, July, 2007, Orlando, Florida, and at the National\nQuality Colloquium Meeting, June 2008, Boston, Massachusetts.\nReferences\nAdvisoryCommittee,AmericanAcademyofPediatrics'MedicalHome\nInitiative for Children With Special Health Care Needs.
