The National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute's/North American Association\nfor the Study of Obesity committee also recommends using\nwaist circumference (WC) cut points of 40 inches (102cm)\nin men and 35 inches (88cm) in women to define \"central\nobesity.\" Increasingly, research shows that WC or central\nobesity is a better predictor of chronic diseases, mainly\ndiabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemias, than over-\nall adiposity assessed using BMI (5,6). WC may be equally or\nmore useful than BMI due to its higher predictive value for\nfuture health risks, ease of measurement, and understanding\nby the general public (4\u00ad6).\nThe question remains unanswered as to whether shifts in\nBMI and WC over the past two decades in the United States\nhave been occurring at equal rate across distributions of both\nmeasures and whether they varied by gender and ethnicity. It\nhas been suggested that the increase in BMI has been concen-\ntrated in higher weight groups based on a recent study (7), a\nfinding with great public health implications in terms of ris-\ning health-care and quality-of-life costs (8,9). While trends in\nmean BMI and obesity prevalence (1,10\u00ad17) and mean WC\nand prevalence of central obesity (18\u00ad23) have been recently\nstudied in the United States and other countries, none have\nlooked at simultaneous distributional shifts (in terms of per-\ncentiles) across time in BMI and WC or have attempted to\nuse those findings to make future projections. In addition, to\ndate, no study has examined those shifts closely across race/\nethnicity groups. Previously, one study assessed distributional\nshifts in terms of percentiles of BMI up to 1994 in the United\nStates (7), while another compared BMI and WC shifts using a\nsimilar methodology in the United Kingdom (24).\nThis study uses the most recent US nationally representative\ncross-sectional data and earlier data to assess the shifts in BMI\nand WC distributions and compare the ethnic- and gender\nGender\u00adethnic Disparity in BMI and Waist\nCircumference Distribution Shifts in US Adults\nMay A. Beydoun1 and Youfa Wang1\nWhile obesity has been increasing in the United States, little is known about the variation in recent BMI and waist\ncircumference (WC) distribution shifts across socio-demographic groups. We assessed shifts in BMI and WC\ndistributions and compared between-group differences over the past decade, and projected future BMI and WC\ndistributions and prevalence of obesity and central obesity using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nacross groups. Average yearly shift was calculated and used for projecting future distributions and prevalence.\nBoth BMI and WC increased more in their uppermost percentile distribution, though BMI shift declined toward the\nuppermost percentiles among women. Heavier Americans gained more adiposity over the past decade. Ethnic\n(non-Hispanic (NH) white vs. black) disparities in mean BMI and WC became wider. Over the survey period, mean BMI\nincreased by 1.3 units vs. 1.8 units among men and women, whereas WC, by 4.2cm vs. 4.8cm. Young adults had the\nlargest increase. Shift in women's WC was stable between the 25th and 75th percentiles, but gained pace at higher\nWC, while women's BMI and men's BMI and WC shifts increased linearly. NH black women had the largest shifts and\nwould have central obesity and obesity prevalence of 90.8 and 70.7% by 2020. Shifts in BMI and WC distribution\nvaried across age-, gender-, and ethnic groups.

We used two series of NHANES\nanalysis, we opted not to include earlier waves of NHANES as our goal\nwas to examine the shifts over the recent two decades, and these more\nrecent data may be better to help predict future trends. Our analyses\nwere \nlimited to participants aged 20 years old.\nsampling design. The survey oversampled older adults (60 years or\nmore) and minority groups (nonHispanic (NH) black and Mexican\nAmericans (MA)). Sampled individuals were first interviewed at\nhome and then invited to a mobile examination center to undergo\nbody measurements, clinical evaluations, and laboratory testing.\nAnthropometric measurements were performed on all study partic-\nipants using standardized methods and equipment. BMI was com-\nputed based on measured weight and height. Weight was measured\non a Toledo self-zoning weight scale while participants wore light\nclothing provided by mobile examination center. Height was mea-\nsured with a stadiometer to the nearest millimeter. As for WC, it was\nmeasured in a standard manner using a steel measuring tape to the\nnearest 0.1cm. positioning it at the high point of the ilium where it\ntinuous annual survey. The data were recently made available for\nto enhance statistical power and obtain a more accurate picture of\nthe current situation. Similar to NHANES III, sampling design was\nstratified multistage with oversampling of older adults and minori-\nties. In addition, the low income population was also oversampled.\nHome interviews were followed by a mobile examination center\nexamination, where follow-up questionnaires, various clinical and\nbody measurements were conducted and blood samples were drawn.\nUsing standardized methods and equipments, anthropometric\nmeasurements including weight, height, and WC were performed\nsimilarly to those in NHANES III (29,30).\nClassification of obesity and central obesity\nObesity was defined as BMI 30kg/m2 and central obesity with WC\nCovariates\nThe socio-demographic variables included in our analysis were age,\ngender, and race/ethnicity.

This\ncan be contrasted with shift patterns among MA men in whom\nWC and BMI seem to change over time with equal amounts\nacross all percentiles and at a faster pace in percentiles over the\n90th. Among MA women, the opposite \npattern was observed\nwhereby BMI percentiles >60th \npercentile appeared to decline\nin absolute value at least up till the 90th percentile. WC shifts\namong MA women had an irregular pattern of acceleration.\nMoreover, Figure 3 shows (in nearly all panels) that the per-\ncentile increases in BMI and WC are highest in the uppermost\npercentiles among men. However, among women, a declining\nshifts in BMI at the uppermost percentiles was noted for certain\nethnic groups including the \"other ethnicity\" category.\nFuture projections: distributions and prevalence estimates\nmen, by 2020 mean BMI will be the highest among NH white\nmen, followed closely by NH black men. However, prevalence of\nobesity and central obesity would be highest among NH white\nand MA men. Among women, mean BMI and WC, obesity and\ncentral obesity prevalence will be the highest among NH black\nwomen by 2020. The rates of increase in both obesity and central\nobesity would be the slowest among MA women. One salient\npattern is that among women, only NH blacks would close the\ngap in prevalence of obesity and central obesity by 2020.\nDiscussion\nOur findings indicate that the rise in adiposity in the United\nStates was unequally distributed across the population and that\nshifts across the spectrum of BMI and WC varied between race/\nethnicity and gender groups. There are several patterns noted\nfor the population-level changes in BMI and WC between the\ntion appeared to shift (increase) faster in the upper end of the\npopulation distribution (i.e., those with high BMI and WC).\nIn other words, heavier Americans had become heavier over\ntime--\"the fat becoming fatter,\" though this varied by gender\nand ethnicity. Although yearly shifts in BMI and WC among\nmen had a similar pattern of linear increase across \npercentiles,\nacceleration in WC shifts at upper percentiles was a more obvi-\nous pattern among women after leveling off between the 20th\nand 90th percentile (Figure 2). BMI appeared to change\nwith greater amounts across all percentiles among NH black\nwomen compared to women of NH white ethnicity, though\nin both cases, the absolute yearly shift tended to decline in\nuppermost percentiles (>90th percentile). The same pattern of\ndecline was observed among MA women and women of other\n\"ethnic\" groups. However, NH black women's shifts in BMI\nbefore the 90th percentile were accelerating in a linear fashion\nwith increased percentile ranking unlike WC which was stable\nacross percentiles, leading to an apparent closure of the gap\nin upper percentiles between these two measures among this\ngender/ethnicgroupcomparedtoNHwhitewomen(Figure3d\nvs. Figure 3b).\nSecond, ethnic disparities in mean BMI and WC have\ning NH blacks to NH whites. In addition, absolute shifts in\nmeans of BMI and WC were consistently the largest among\nNH black women and young women aged 20\u00ad29 years and the\nsmallest among MA and older adults aged 50\u00ad59 years. In fact,\namong older subjects (50+), there was a clear discontinuity in\nthe mean BMI shifts whereby those aged 60\u00ad69 experience the\nlargest increase. This finding was also observed in a recent lon-\ngitudinal study and may be related to the survival of heavier\nsubjects over time who had higher access to Medicare services\nrather than a biological phenomenon (32).\nThird, based on the trends observed in the past decade, WC\nis projected to become increasingly displaced to the right with\nno significant downward curve shift. In contrast, the BMI dis-\ntribution is expected to become increasingly flat over time.\nAssuming little change in demographic composition for the\nUnited States in the next 15 years, we projected the future\nBMI and WC distribution and the prevalence of obesity and\n\ncentral obesity for each gender/ethnic group. We projected\nthese prevalence rates would remain the highest among NH\nTwo previous studies conducted among adults in the United\nUnited Kingdom came to similar conclusions, a dissymmetric\nness with a greater shift in its upper part, but the authors did\nnot examine WC (7). They argued that the patterns suggested\na combination of both profound environmental determinants\nand a population with a high degree of susceptibility. A recent\nUK study shows marked shifts in both BMI and WC and a\ncombination of overall upward increase and a rise in skewness,\nwhich was more pronounced among younger British adults.\nIn particular, WC increased by >8cm in 10 years in young\nwomen, ~0.8cm/year (24). In our US study population, for all\nadults ages combined, the 90th percentile of WC increased at\n0.5\u00ad0.7cm/year, which is comparable to the UK study. Young\nUS adults also experienced more sizeable shifts in mean WC\ncompared to their older counterparts.\nIn addition to the overall BMI and WC shift patterns, the\nvariation in the shifts across gender and race/ethnicity groups\nmay provide hints about the causes of the obesity epidemic in\nthe United States. Whereas genetic drifts are unlikely to occur\nwithin a decade, environmental and behavioral changes are more\nprobable roots to this problem. It is possible, however, that differ-\nences in weight gain across race/ethnicity and gender groups are\nbehavioral and environmental responses that are also dependent\non genetic susceptibility. Gene\u00adenvironment interaction model\nfits well to help explain human adiposity (33\u00ad35). Our findings\nsuggest that subjects who are genetically susceptible and belong\nto the upper percentiles of the \ndistribution (BMI or WC) may be\ndifferentially affected by (or respond to) environmental changes\nthat promote weight and adiposity and gain.\nOur findings point to a gender\u00adethnicity interaction\nwhereby environmental changes had similar effects in some\narticles\n \ncases and divergent effects in others on overall adiposity (BMI)\nand body fat distribution as WC indicates visceral fat. Among\nmen, in general, shift patterns in BMI and WC were similar\nparticularly among MA. In contrast, yearly BMI shifts among\nwomen had an upward trend with increasing percentiles, while\nWC patterns of shifts were constant at least between the 25th\nand 75th percentiles. NH black women had the highest yearly\nincrease for both WC and BMI. However, their prevalence of\nobesity (BMI  30) appeared to increase at a faster pace than\ncentral obesity, indicating that environmental changes may\naffect weight gain to a larger extent than abdominal fat deposi-\ntion. In all other groups, except for women of \"other ethnicity,\"\ncomparable increases were noted for prevalence of obesity and\ncentral obesity.\nThe finding that the increase in overall and central adipos-\nity has been mostly noted among young adults, particularly\nwomen, suggests that environmental changes have impacted\nmore strongly on this demographic group in recent years,\nalthough this may also be due to their relatively lower initial\nprevalence. Lifestyles that are more likely to be adopted by\nyoung people include intake of high energy density foods and\nsnacking habits, eating away-from-home and sedentary behav-\niors (e.g., computer games, internet, TV watching habits) are\nall possible mechanisms explaining age disparities.\nThis study has a number of strengths. First, it is based on\na representative data of adults in the United States and our\nanalysis corrected for design complexity and yielded national\nestimates. Second, it is the first study to examine shifts in both\nWC and BMI simultaneously in the United States and com-\npare those shifts across gender, age, and race/ethnicity groups.\nThird, it is also the first to use past trends in distributional\nshifts in both anthropometric parameters to project future\nprevalence estimates for obesity and central obesity.\nOur study also suffers from a few limitations. First, the trend\nanalyses are based on two nationally representative cross-\n\nsectional surveys that were conducted independently 10.5 years\napart. It is possible that minor differences in sampling design\nand shifts in population composition might have affected the\nestimated changes in BMI and WC. A recent descriptive report\nof longitudinal changes from US studies that included BMI and\nother measures of adiposity indicated that annual changes in\nBMI were greater within cohort studies initiated during the\nNHANES-I follow-up study) (32). In other word, people of the\nsame age gained more weight/BMI with age during more recent\nyears than the past. On average, the later cohorts' annual BMI\nAmerican men and women for mid ages 32\u00ad77 years than the\nNHANES-I follow-up study cohort. On average, the annual\nchanges in BMI within each cohort examined ranged between\nunits (for black women aged 29 years at baseline), depending\non baseline age within the cohort, gender, race/ethnicity, and\nthe cohorts. In general, these values seemed to be comparable\nto our findings of BMI annual percentile shifts, which varied\nupper percentiles. Second, our future projections of BMI and\nWC distribution and related obesity prevalence are based on\nthe trends observed in the past and on an assumption of few\nfuture population composition changes. This is an oversimpli-\nfied scenario because our analysis did not attempt to accurately\npredict the future situation and there are many uncertainties\nregarding the future population distribution and environmen-\ntal and policy changes in the United States. On the other hand,\nour projected estimates are gender- and race/\nethnicity specific,\nand thus have controlled partly for some possible population\ncomposition changes. Third, some of the shift patterns observed\nmay be affected by smaller samples sizes for minority groups\n(e.g., women of \"other ethnicity\") selected by NHANES, which\nwere subject to large estimate errors or uncertainties.\nOur findings have some important policy implications. One\nis that the national goals specified in Healthy People 2010\nrelated to obesity cannot be met. These goals need be reas-\nsessed and reframed to be more realistic and may need to target\nthe whole population rather than only the overweight groups.\nIn addition, when setting the Healthy People 2020 goals, the\ndifferential shifts in adiposity measures across the population\ndistribution need be considered; and more dramatic and effec-\ntive national programs and policies are needed to help achieve\nthe goals due to the multilevel nature of the obesity etiology\n(36\u00ad38). One of our recent studies shows that if the obesity\nincrease trend in the United States is not controlled, it can have\nmany serious public health and social consequences. For exam-\nple, by 2048, the overall prevalence of overweight and obesity\namong American adults would approach 100% and the total\nhealth-care costs attributable to obesity and overweight would\nIn conclusion, while overall, means of BMI and WC have\nincreased significantly over time and are expected to do so for\nmost socio-demographic groups in the United States, \npatterns\nof shifts in distribution differed between these two \nmeasures\nand across gender and ethnic groups. In most of these groups,\nit is clear that the heavy is becoming heavier though \ncentral\nadiposity (measured by WC) is increasing more rapidly at\nthe uppermost percentiles, with a nonlinear shift pattern\nobserved among women, and an absolute increase in WC\nleveling off at a high value for most of the distribution among\nNH black women. Broader and more comprehensive and\n\nvigorousprevention,screening,andtreatmentprogramsshould\nbe implemented to reverse the shifts in adiposity \nmeasures,\nwe observed. Creative initiatives to impact environmental\nchanges are needed. In addition, ethnic and gender disparities\nshould be studied further to disentangle the biological from\nthe \nenvironment components explaining those differences in\ndistributional shifts.\n"
