I can think of four such. Let us, for example,\nimagine (1) a late acquisition scenario, according to which humans would experience onset of\nlanguage acquisition at a later age - say at ten years instead of two \u00ad but would retain a learning\npotential throughout the lifespan. Next, let us imagine (2) a minimalist scenario, by which we\nwould be endowed with a bare-bones set of grammar rules something along the lines of an\nartificial language like Esperanto that would be innately specified in all speakers of all\nlanguages, so that adult second language acquisition would simply be the relatively easy matter\nof acquiring the vocabulary of a foreign group. Then there is (3) a gradualist scenario by which,\nsay, onset of acquisition would be at a very young age but full fluency would not come about\nuntil adulthood. And finally, let us imagine (4) an unbounded scenario, by which language\nwould develop in a brain of unbounded plasticity, so that adult second language acquisition\n(SLA) would be no different than child first language acquisition. Whenever adults or children\nlearn a new language, they would just start from scratch.\nHagen replies to Hirschfeld\nThe debate we are now having boils down to this: Why did evolution select our actual\nontogenesis of language rather than one of these possible ones? Hirschfeld tries to answer this\nquestion first by arguing that \"that the ease with which children simultaneously learn multiple\nlanguages evinces a state of sustained cooperation and exchange between groups such that\nspeakers of different groups, speaking different languages, recurrently commingled over long\nperiods of time\" (pp. 182-183) It is worth noting in the first place that the end of Hirschfeld's\ndiscussion includes a strong argument against this position. He writes that \"the period during\nwhich most complex cognitive functions evolved was characterized by extremely sparse\nsettlement patterns,\" (p. 184) which hardly counts as \"evidence for an ancestral environment in\nwhich distinct groups commingled through long-term trading and marriage relationships) in\nrelative security\" (p. 182). I should point out as well that when linguists describe childhood\nlanguage acquisition as \"rapid,\" they mean rapid with respect to (a) the complexity of the task,\nand (b) the laborious pace at which adults manage to do the same thing. In reality, it takes about\ntwo years of sustained (not occasional!) exposure for a child to become a fluent speaker of a\nlanguage.\nHirschfeld further argues that child bilingualism is \"all the remarkable since some of the\nprocesses that enable bilingual acquisition (e.g., establishing two distinct lexicons) would\notherwise seem to compete with processes that enable single language acquisition (e.g., a single\nword for each whole object)\" (p. 183). Hirschfeld is wrong on both counts. Language acquisition\nis nothing at all a process of \"learning a single word for each whole object.\" A child may learn\nmany words for a certain \"whole object\" like a certain small friendly animal, e.g., dog,\ndachshund, hound, pet, Fred, animal, canine, mutt, animal, beast, critter, etc. Even among\nmonolinguals, learning synonyms has no negative effect on prior learned knowledge. And as I\npointed out in my original article, learning new words is the one aspect of language acquisition\nthat is not adversely affected by age.\nIt is true, as Hirschfeld notes, that children can acquire several languages without\nsignificant decrement to first language acquisition. But then, so can adults: they just can't do it\nnearly as easily as children can. Hirschfeld cites this in support of his position by arguing as\nfollows:\nDuring the period in which young children acquire their first language, they are\ncapable of (and often do) acquire several languages without significant decrement to\nfirst language acquisition. This ability to effortlessly acquire several languages is a\nsingular design feature of the LAD. What other complex cognitive skill is unaffected\nby doubling or even tripling the acquisition task? (p.183)\nThe short answer to his rhetorical question \"what other complex cognitive skill is unaffected by\ndoubling or even tripling the acquisition task?\" is \"almost all of them.\" Mathematics is surely\ncognitively complex, but one's understanding of addition is not adversely affected by a\nsubsequent learning of multiplication, and learning multiplication, in turn, is not adversely\naffected by the simultaneous learning of division. A gifted musician can learn or even compose a\nrichly elaborate symphony for 30 or more instruments without adversely affecting her knowledge\nof other symphonies she has learned, or is learning. Moreover, the most current research in\ntheoretical syntax has shown that languages do not vary in any but the most superficial ways (see\nBaker, 2002; Boeckx, 2006). The mystery for theoretical linguists is not that children can acquire\nmore than one language, but that they can acquire abstract linguistic principles in the first place.\nNext, Hirschfeld turns to the acquisition of foreign accents (almost always a dead\ngiveaway of someone who has acquired a language in adulthood) and their relevance to\nHagen replies to Hirschfeld\nprehistoric raiding parties and the subjugation of fertile women. His hypothesis leads him to the\nessentially meaningless conclusion that \"a language learner's propensity not to acquire foreign-\naccented pronunciation seems a plausible feature of an evolved LAD.\" Under the circumstances\nhe describes, the victim of an intergroup raid will acquire the accent of her captors, so long as\nshe is kidnapped at a young age. It is only when she is captured and kidnapped after adolescence\nthat she will acquire the language of her captors with difficulty, and therefore retain traces of her\nfirst-language pronunciation. It is difficult to see how those facts support the view of an ancestral\nenvironment in which distinct groups typically commingled in relative security.\nFinally, Hirschfeld writes:\nMuch of my speculation here is based on a fairly simple observation: in terms of\ncomplex cognitive mechanisms, it is less languages that have evolved than language\nacquisition devices. Increasingly more complex linguistic structures emerged as\ndistinct LADs evolved, presumably as adaptations to challenges grounded in shifts in\nthe human and nonhuman environments. (p. 184)\nIt is not at all clear what this is intended to prove. The evidence that languages have evolved \u00ad\nand have done so in ways that parallel natural evolution to an uncanny degree - is immense and\nirrefutable. The discipline we call historical linguistics would be as pointless as phrenology if\nlanguages did not mutate over time. In fact, as I pointed out the original article, language\nmutation and language drift are evidence of long periods of cultural isolation; still more evidence\nagainst Hirschfeld's hypothesis. Plausibly the LAD (actually, it's now called UG for \"Universal\nGrammar\" in most linguistic work) did evolve in the 2 million year history of the genus Homo.\nHowever there is no evidence that it has evolved appreciably during the 200,000-year history of\nHomo sapiens, and there is no evidence that linguistic structures have become cognitively more\ncomplex. What happened before the advent of Homo sapiens is anybody's guess. Whatever our\nactual evolutionary history was, the one thing that is clear is that our brains did not evolve in a\nmanner that facilitates adult language acquisition. Ironically, that is the one fact that Hirschfeld\ndoes not even try to explain in his reply.\nAll told, the view of prehistory that emerges from Hirschfeld's hypothesis is that\nPleistocene hunter-gatherers lived in small bands that were widely diffuse across the Eurasian\nand African continents; that they traveled at the whims of migratory animals on which they\ndepended; that they nevertheless managed to stay in permanent contact with other small bands\nthat were following other herds; that they did so with no sophisticated means of communication;\nthat their children stayed with these other bands for years at a time in order to become fluent in a\nforeign language, and that adults did not (or else they too would have evolved an endowment for\neasy language acquisition); that this was a universal habit of hunter-gatherer bands that resulted\nin a universal endowment for bilingualism; that all children of all bands participated in these\nforeign exchange programs; and that in spite of these common interactions, there later evolved\nthousands, and perhaps tens of thousands, of mutually incomprehensible languages. The only\nmotivation we have for accepting this implausible scenario is a lingering distaste among some\nanthropologists for the Hobbesian view of humanity before civilization.\nThe constraints on adult SLA make a lot more sense when we compare our language\nphylogeny to a more familiar case. When Darwin visited the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, he was struck by\nwhere the vegetation grew close to the ground were inhabited by tortoises with a domed carapace\nthat limited upward mobility of the animal's neck. The regions where vegetation was higher off\nthe ground, on the other hand, were inhabited by animals with longer limbs and an arched\nHagen replies to Hirschfeld\ncarapace that allowed the neck to reach vegetation on bushes. The job of the naturalist is to figure\nout what sort of history led to this state of affairs. Surely the tortoises were not purposefully\ndesigned in that way: the parsimonious solution would have been to create only arched-shells,\nwhich are no impediment to eating vegetation on the ground. Surely the two subspecies did not\ncommingle among the islands, because then we would expect to see arched and domed carapaces\nequally distributed across the islands (or, more likely, only one phenotype). The truly bizarre\nstate of affairs would have been to find the domed shelled tortoises on islands where brush is\nabundant, and the arched shells on islands where there is no brush. A nearly equally bizarre state\nof affairs would be to find hunter-gatherer adults who had a flair for second language acquisition\neven though it did them no good. In other words, if our hunting-gathering ancestors lived in a\nworld \"characterized by extremely sparse settlement patterns\" as Hirschfeld asserts, then an\nendowment for adult second language acquisition would have been for them what an arched\ncarapace would be for a tortoise living on an island with no bushes, i.e., a trait that would have\nbrought with it no survival advantages and therefore would not have made the evolutionary cut.\nReferences\nBaker, M.
