    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn many countries in recent decades, great importance has been placed on the concept of quality assurance in education. In\nSlovenian schools, quality assessment and assurance processes are based on a combination of self-evaluation and external\nevaluation, although significantly more weight has been attached to self-evaluation than external evaluation lately. Efforts to\nachieve the highest possible levels of quality and school work performance are based on the assumption that the concept\nof quality should be developed at the level of the professional autonomy of schools and individual teachers. Our empirical\nresearch, which was conducted on a sample of 1,530 teachers, counselors, and headteachers of primary and secondary\nschools in Slovenia, showed that the majority of professional workers in education recognize the importance of conducting\nself-evaluation for their profession. Using factor analysis, it was established that the frequency of conducting self-evaluation\nin schools is most affected by the following factors: (a) the opinion of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors on the\npositive effects of self-evaluation; (b) the school climate; (c) the attitude of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors\ntoward research; and (d) the attitude of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors toward their own professional\ndevelopment. Multiple regression analysis of the obtained factors was made, and a model was designed to predict the\nfrequency of the performance of self-evaluation. It was established that the frequency of conducting self-evaluation is most\nstrongly affected by the attitude of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors toward their own professional development\nand by their opinions on the positive effects of self-evaluation.\n",

One of the main reasons for the need to\ntransfer greater responsibility and autonomy to the school in\nthe process of quality assurance is that increased organiza-\ntional authority of schools enhances their flexibility, thus\nenabling higher quality work adapted to the realities of the\njob. Processes of quality assessment and assurance are\nclosely linked to research work: more specifically, to con-\nducting self-evaluation research (Podgornik & Mazgon,\n2015). The idea that teachers should conduct research work,\nand that they should be reflective practitioners, originates\nwhich teachers were trained to carry out action research and\nself-evaluation of educational practice (Stenhouse, 1975).\nResearch work was addressed as an integral part of the daily\ntasks of teachers, and the results served as a basis for further\nplanning of educational work (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015).\nMany researchers (e.g., Berger, Boles, & Troen, 2005;\nWilson, 2000) have established that teachers' research work,\nincluding self-evaluation, is an important factor of their pro-\nfessional development, and of achieving quality educational\nwork. According to researchers, self-evaluation or research\nwork enables teachers to become more familiar with students,\nthe institution and themselves as teachers, resulting in changes\n1University of Ljubljana, Slovenia\nCorresponding Author:\nJanez Vogrinc, Associate Professor, Faculty of Education, University of\nEmail: janez.vogrinc@pef.uni-lj.si\nThe Role of Headteachers, Teachers,\nand School Counselors in the System of\nQuality Assessment and Assurance of\nSchool Work\nVesna Podgornik1 and Janez Vogrinc1\n Keywords\nquality assurance, education system, self-evaluation, research work, reflective practitioner\n2 SAGE Open\nin their teaching practice in line with research findings.\nTeachers consequently feel more competent and advance pro-\nfessionally, they are able to better reflect on their classroom\nwork, they gain a deeper insight into the process of teaching\nand educating, their research work facilitates the transfer of\ntheir theoretical knowledge into practice, and so on.\nEvaluation studies are focused primarily on changing the\nexisting status, with a fundamental objective of achieving\nprogress in practice. Based on the ongoing and final conclu-\nsions of evaluation research, plans for further work are\ndeveloped that include the introduction of changes and\nimprovements directly into educational practice (Podgornik\n& Mazgon, 2015). Evaluation in education is therefore a pro-\ncess aimed at determining the extent and manner of achiev-\ning educational goals. It is the process of systematically\ncollecting information on the achievement of these goals,\nwith a view to resolving current issues directly in educational\npractice. Factors that are proven to have a positive impact on\nthe achievement of the set goals are retained in the future,\nwhile in areas where the set goals have not been achieved, it\nis necessary to consider the reasons for this and to seek\nimprovement.\nIn general, evaluation is therefore the process of gathering\ninformation (according to relevant criteria, with measure-\nments and corresponding analysis) to establish a rational\nbasis for assessment in decisive situations (Stufflebeam,\n1985). Through evaluation, evidence and verifiable findings\nare obtained regarding the quality of programs, projects, ser-\nvices,organizations,andtheworkofindividuals(Stufflebeam\nSelf-evaluation is not, however, a subjective, arbitrary\nassessment of work by the individual school or teacher;\nobjective understanding is required. The basic sense of self-\nevaluation is that the school and teachers assess their own\nstatus by employing various research methods, data collec-\ntion techniques and instruments that can be standardized or\ndesigned for the needs of specific evaluation studies. Self-\nevaluation is always associated with a tendency to provide\nthe highest quality of school work. There are, however, dif-\nfering views on what actually constitutes the quality of\nschool work and which approaches are most appropriate to\nquality assessment and assurance.\nPrinciples and Approaches to Quality\nAssessment and Assurance in\nEducation\nQuality is an elusive concept, as it varies in space and time.\nIt depends on the context in which it appears, as well as on\nthe interests, values, beliefs, and so forth of the individual\nsociety, or even of individuals. Quality in education must be\nseen in the context of the respective cultural discourse\n(Stronach, 1999). At the European level, quality in educa-\ntion is perceived as a structured concept comprising 16 indi-\ncators in four different fields of education: (a) attainment\n(indicators: mathematics, reading, science, information and\ncommunications technology (ICT), foreign languages,\nlearning to learn, civics), (b) success in the transition\nbetween different levels (dropout rates, completion of sec-\nondary education, and preparation for tertiary education),\n(c) monitoring of school education (evaluation and steering\nof school education, parental participation), and (d)\nresources and structures (education and training of teachers,\nthe level of participation in pre-primary education, the num-\nber of students per computer, and the educational expendi-\nture per student; cf. \"Indicators on the Quality of School\nAccording to Sallis (2002), the quality of school work is a\ndynamic concept that cannot be specified, because quality\nhas many meanings. To define quality, the factors contribut-\ning to a good school must therefore be discussed. Sallis iden-\ntifies four imperatives of quality: (a) the moral imperative,\nwhich dictates that all \"clients\" or \"users\" (students, parents,\ncommunity, etc.) are entitled to the highest quality educa-\ntional services; (b) the professional imperative, which is\nclosely linked to the moral imperative, that is, all institutions\nare obliged to provide students with an educational process\nthat meets the highest professional standards; (c) the com-\npetitive imperative, that is, the ability of educational organi-\nzations to cope with the challenge of competition, with one\nof the most effective approaches being constant care for\nimproving the quality of their services and processes; and (d)\nthe imperative of accountability, according to which educa-\ntional organizations are part of their environment and are\nexpected to act responsibly toward the funders, which\nincludes ensuring a public demonstration of the high stan-\ndards of the processes and services of the organization.\nWithin the process of quality assessment and assurance,\nSallis distinguishes three basic approaches1 to quality: (a)\nquality control, (b) quality assurance, and (c) total quality\nmanagement.\nQuality control includes the planned and systematic\nsupervision of the process and the status outcome, as well as\nthe necessary corrections of activities to fulfill the set require-\nments. It therefore includes the identification and elimination\nof processes and services that do not meet the standards.\nQuality assurance is a proactive approach whose main task is\nto prevent errors or their repetition. This approach is adopted\ninternally by all employees, who aim for the quality improve-\nment of their work, with the standards and criteria being\nestablished within the organization (Dahlgaard, Kristensen,\nin the process of operation of an institution, aiming at ensur-\ning conditions for its operation that allow for the achieve-\nment of the pre-established goals. Total quality management\nis a proactive approach that builds on approaches to quality\nassurance. It is a conceptual approach that relies on internal\nand ubiquitous quality improvement, focusing on the inte-\ngration of all employees at all times and in all processes. The\nphilosophy behind it is never-ending, long-term quality\nPodgornik and Vogrinc 3\nimprovement, undertaken step by step and focusing on the\nEurydice (2008) data show that the arrangements made\nfor evaluating the quality of educational institutions and\nadopted in various countries can be classified into three\nsystems. The first system emphasizes the evaluation func-\ntion of inspection bodies and the standardization of evalua-\ntion criteria; the second system focuses on the role of the\nnational accountability structure in schools and includes the\ndevelopment of national standards, while the evaluative\nrole is transferred to local authorities and the funders of\neducational institutions; and the third system includes\ncountries that have not formally established the system of\naccountability.\nAssessment and Quality Assurance\nProcesses in Slovenian Primary and\nSecondary Schools\nIn Slovenia, compulsory basic education (from now onwards\nprimary school)\nlasts for nine years and is divided into three educational triads.\nChildren enter primary school at the age of 6. In the first\neducational triad, pupils are taught by a class teacher. From Year\n4 to Year 6, the number of subject teachers gradually increases,\nso that pupils can get used to having several teachers. Subject\nteachers teach exclusively in the third educational triad and in\nupper-secondary schools. (Valencic Zuljan, Cotic, Fosnaric,\nPrimary schools provide a compulsory and extended cur-\nriculum. The compulsory curriculum must be provided by\nschools and studied by all pupils. It consists of compulsory\nsubjects, electives, home room periods, and activity days\n(culture, science, sports, technology). School must provide\nthe optional elementary school curriculum, but pupils are\nfree to decide whether they will participate (\"Educational\npupils are assessed in national examinations in the mother\ntongue and mathematics, in Year 6 also in a foreign lan-\nguage, and in Year 9 in a subject determined by the Minister\n(out of compulsory subjects from the Year 8 and 9). Results\ndo not affect pupils' grades; they are only an additional\ninformation about their knowledge levels (\"Assessment in\nUpper-secondary education is organised in general and\nprofessional grammar schools (so-called gimnazije), with a\nduration of four years, in technical and professional schools\n(with a duration of four years), and in vocational schools (three\nyears, except for shorter vocational education courses, which\nlast for two years). The objectives of professional and technical\neducation and training are to develop key competences, skills\nand vocational qualifications at an internationally comparable\nlevel and to provide knowledge and skills for employment,\nfurther education and lifelong learning. (Valencic Zuljan et al.,\nTechnical and professional schools end with a Vocational Matura\nexam (exam in four subjects; the exams are prepared externally\nand assessed internally). (\"Educational System in Slovenia,\"\nGymnasia offer students four years of general education aimed\nat upgrading and extending the knowledge gained during\ncompulsory education. Gymnasia ends with a Matura exam--an\nexternally prepared and assessed exam in 5 subjects, 3 of which\nare compulsory and 2 which are elective. (Valencic Zuljan et al.,\nAll teachers and school counselors who would like to\nwork in primary and upper secondary schools are required\nto complete a second-cycle study programme and attain a master's\ndegree (300 ECTS) in order to be able to enter the teaching\nprofession. Teacher education study programmes comprise the\nstudy of the subject discipline, education sciences (included\nResearch in Education where they gain knowledge about self-\nevaluation) and pedagogical training. School counsellors have to\ncomplete a master study programme in psychology, pedagogy,\nsocial pedagogy, special education, inclusive education or social\nwork. Teachers and school counsellors also have to pass the State\nTeacher Certification Examination, a national exam, taken before\nthe National Examination Board for professional competency\nexaminations in the field of education, which is appointed by\nthe Minister of Education. (Valencic Zuljan et al., 2011,\nThe State Teacher Certification Examination consists of\noral examination that includes the constitution of the\nRepublic of Slovenia, the constitution of the European Union\nand its legal system, and regulations specifying human and\nchildren's rights and basic privileges, legislation in the area\nof education, and Slovenian written language (Valencic\nThe weekly teaching load is up to 22 teaching hours for\nteachers in primary school and up to 20 teaching hours for\nteachers in secondary school. Rest of the time (till a 40-hr\nweekly workload), teachers spent on lesson preparation,\nassessment of pupils products, the implementation of self-\nevaluation, care for their own professional development,\nand so on. School counselors have a 40-hr weekly workload\nand one of their main task is also self-evaluation of school\nwork. Teachers and school counselors that wish to gain new\nknowledge can participate in in-service training throughout\ntheir careers. They are enabled by their employer to partici-\npate \"in programmes of professional education that are pub-\nlished within the selection of programmes of further\neducation and training at least 5 days a year or at least 15\n312). However, there are also other programs or models\nimportant for their professional development like: thematic\n4 SAGE Open\nconferences, study groups, professional staff networks,\nresearch work, and so on.\nThe Organisation and Financing of Education Act (2008)\nprovides the formal and legal framework for quality assess-\nment and assurance in education, assigning the obligation to\nassess and assure quality to the headteacher. As a type of\nevaluation, the execution of self-evaluation is also the\nresponsibility of the headteacher. The school management is\nobliged to produce an annual report on self-evaluation in the\nschool, which must be adopted by the School Council.\nFurthermore, schools undertake an analysis of the implemen-\ntation of the annual work plan. This can also be understood\nas a form of self-evaluation and is a useful starting point for\nthe further planning of work.\nIn Slovenian primary and secondary schools, the pro-\ncesses of quality assessment and assurance are based on a\ncombination of self-evaluation and external evaluation,\nalthough lately significantly more weight has been attached\nto self-evaluation. External evaluation is carried out by the\nMinistry of Education within the scope of accreditation pro-\ncesses, when determining the fulfillment of the basic require-\nments for the fundamental quality of work (verifying the\nsuitability of premises, staff, programs and other conditions).\nA special form of external evaluation in Slovenia falls within\nthe tasks of the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for\nEducation and Sport (The School Inspection Act, 2005).\nSchool inspection includes monitoring the implementation\nof laws, other regulations, and acts governing the organiza-\ntion and implementation of education and training provided\nby kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools.\nThus, the principal task of school inspection is monitoring\nthe correct fulfillment of formal requirements, whereas peda-\ngogical decisions (e.g., the choice of learning forms and\nmethods of work, the realization of the curriculum, etc.) are\nwithin the domain of the individual teacher or school.\nOther activities in the system of quality assessment and\nassurance are based on the self-evaluation approach. Thus,\nSlovenia has decided to move away from focusing on quality\nassessment and assurance as a process of control over the\nwork of educational institutions and teaching staff (Podgornik\n& Mazgon, 2015). Rather than emphasizing external verifi-\ncation of the results achieved and planning processes to\nensure their improvement, there is a tendency to transfer the\ncare for the quality of education to the institutions and\nteachers.\nIn Slovenia, the process of self-evaluation is supported by\nvarious national projects for quality assurance. Most of these\nprojects are based on self-evaluation, with the data sources\nbeing both objective (achievements that can be determined\nrelatively objectively) and subjective (opinions of various\nparticipants, acquired in very different ways).\nThe use of different databases has even become an ele-\nment of quality assessment and assurance. Primary and sec-\nondary schools typically assess the learning performance of\ntheir population in relation to national results (external\nknowledge examinations in primary school and at the end of\nsecondary school), while teachers perform individual and\ngroup reflection on the performance of their students in indi-\nvidual subjects.\nIn Slovenia, data on the learning outcomes of students are\ncollected every year by the National Examinations Centre\nthrough the compulsory National Assessment of Knowledge\nschool year, also in Year 6 of primary school. At the second-\nary-school level, these data are collected through the school-\nleaving exam taken at the end of grammar school (so-called\nMatura) and secondary technical and vocational schools (so-\ncalled Vocational Matura; The Matura Examination Act,\nobtained can be combined with other data and used to evalu-\nate the national education system. In primary school, the\nNAK has a formative role and students' knowledge is not\nassessed, but the data are nonetheless collected to monitor\nthe progress of students in terms of meeting the set knowl-\nedge standards.\nSlovenia also participates in various international studies\n(e.g., PISA, TIMSS, etc.) based on the comparison of learn-\ning outcomes of students from various countries in specific\nareas (e.g., mathematics, science, literacy, etc.). If properly\nanalyzed and interpreted, this information provides the state\nwith an important element for assessing the international\ncomparability of the education system.\nTo accurately define the quality status of the education\nsystem and to devise a plan that should lead to improvements\nin this area, it is important to analyze and take into account\nthe data collected by external assessment (e.g., international\nknowledge research, NAK), but findings from self-evalua-\ntion research are also used in the interpretation of these data.\nA single data source is not sufficient for a detailed analysis,\nas each approach has its advantages and disadvantages.\nExternal assessment enables more objective data collection,\nensuring greater objectivity of the produced, evaluated, and\ninterpreted results, and allowing for a comparison of the\nachievements of the individual with his or her peers on the\nnational (i.e., NAK, Matura) or international level (e.g.,\nTIMSS, PISA). This provides teachers with important addi-\ntional (more objective) feedback on their students' knowl-\nedge, and thus, indirectly, on their own work. The weakness\nof external assessment is that the interpretation of results\ndoes not take into account the characteristics of the individ-\nual institutions in which students learn and teachers work.\nSuch information is easier to obtain using a self-evaluation\nsurvey implemented by teachers who are very familiar with\nthe institution in which they work. To interpret the data col-\nlected by external assessment correctly, it is necessary to\nconsider the whole context: the sociocultural environment in\nwhich the institution is located, the characteristics of the stu-\ndents, the nature of cooperation between parents and teach-\ners, which professional development options are available to\nteachers, how the institution is equipped, and so on. It is\nPodgornik and Vogrinc 5\ntherefore important that external assessment data are com-\nbined with data collected through self-evaluation studies,\nand that on this basis measures are proposed that should lead\nto higher quality educational work.\nPurpose and Method of the Research\nThe research work of practitioners can be understood as an\nattempt to link teaching and research so that they are no lon-\nger two separate tasks, instead becoming interrelated and\ncomplementary activities (Cole & Knowles, 2004). It is cru-\ncial that the research work of teachers is carried out by the\nteachers themselves (possibly with the assistance of external\nresearch experts), and that it follows the criteria of scientific\nresearch and thus also the principles of research ethics.\nIn the present empirical research, the focus was on the\nconducting of self-evaluation research in Slovenian primary\nand secondary schools, based on the assumption that, if we\nwant the results of self-evaluation to form the basis for the\nfurther planning of educational work, the concept of quality\nneeds to be developed at the level of the professional auton-\nomy of the school and the individual teacher (Podgornik &\nThe frequency of self-evaluation research depends on\nmany factors (e.g., the teacher's knowledge of conducting\nself-evaluation research, etc.), with the views of headteachers,\nteachers, and school counselors on the importance of conduct-\ning self-evaluation research being an important element. The\nfocus of the present empirical research was therefore the views\nof respondents on research and the performance of self-evalu-\nation, as well as on their own professional development.\nThe empirical research established:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Whether headteachers, teachers, and school counsel-\nors of primary and secondary schools differ in their\nopinions on the importance of self-evaluation for their\nprofession;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How pedagogical workers (headteachers, teachers,\nand school counselors) at primary and secondary\nschools rate their qualification to perform certain\nactivities within a self-evaluation survey (setting\ngoals or content planning, methodological planning,\ndesigning instruments for data collection, etc.);\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How the following factors act as predictors of differ-\nences in the frequency of the performance of self-\nevaluation: (a) the opinion of professionals on the\npositive effects of self-evaluation, (b) the school cli-\nmate, (c) the attitude of professionals toward research,\nand (d) the attitude of professionals toward their own\nprofessional development.\nBasic Research Method\nThe basic research methods are the descriptive and causal\nnon-experimental methods of pedagogical research. The\nstudy is based on the quantitative research paradigm.\nSample\nThe research involved 1,530 respondents. The sample was\nselected systematically, with primary and secondary schools\nfrom various geographical areas of Slovenia being included\nin the survey.

The overall responsiveness of\nThe questionnaire on the performance of self-evaluation\nin secondary school was completed by 421 respondents. The\nquestionnaires were returned by 33 secondary schools. The\nData Collection and Instrument\nThe data were collected using questionnaires designed for\nprimary and secondary-school headteachers, teachers, and\ncounselors. Six content-related questionnaires were com-\npiled, each tailored to a specific group of respondents (e.g.,\nthe statement from the questionnaire for teachers \"Teachers\nmust evaluate their work\" was changed into \"Headteachers\nmust evaluate their work\" in the questionnaire for head-\nteachers and into \"School counselors must evaluate their\nwork\" in the questionnaire for school counselors). When\ndrawing up the questionnaire, an analysis of the literature on\nthe performance of self-evaluation was considered, and the\nTable 1.

The data were collected by a questionnaire, consist-\ning of seven rating scales (the rating scale of the areas of\nsubjected to the self-evaluation of teachers and counselors;\nthe rating scale of the reasons that affect the frequency of\nself-evaluation; the rating scale of the approaches that could\ncontribute to the more effective implementation of self-\nevaluation; the rating scale of the headteachers', teachers',\nand school counselors' competence for the implementation\nof the various stages of self-evaluation; the rating scale of\nknowledge of national projects to identify and provide for\nthe quality of educational work; the rating scale of the char-\nacteristics that the pedagogical staff attach to self-evalua-\ntion; the rating scale of how much time the teachers of\nprimary and secondary schools devote to the reflection of\nspecific areas of their work) and of the Likert-type scale of\nattitudes. In the article, only the data collected by the Likert-\ntype scale of attitudes, which was used to establish the atti-\ntude of headteachers, teachers, and counselors to their\nprofessional development, research, and the implementation\nof self-evaluation (the Likert-type scale of attitudes com-\nprised 22 items) and the data collected by the rating scale of\nthe headteachers', teachers', and school counselors' compe-\ntence for the implementation of the various stages of self-\nevaluation (the rating scale comprised eight items) shall be\npresented.\nThe validity of the questionnaire was checked with factor\nanalysis--specifically, the percentage of variance explained\nby the first factor--while the reliability of the questionnaire\nwas tested with Cronbach's coefficient alpha.\nFrom the data presented (Table 3), it is evident that the\nscales achieve sufficient reliability (Cronbach's  coefficient\n .60) and validity (more than 20% of the variance is\nexplained with the first factor).\nAn envelope was sent to each school containing one\nquestionnaire each for the headteacher and the counselor, as\nwell as 10 questionnaires for primary-school teachers and\n15 questionnaires for secondary-school teachers. The head-\nteachers were asked to distribute the questionnaires to teach-\ners in alphabetical order (regardless of the class they taught,\nthe subject they taught, the educational program they taught,\netc.). If a particular school employed more than one coun-\nselor, it was requested that the questionnaire be completed\nby the counselor with more years of work experience. The\nheadteacher appointed a person to collect the questionnaires\nat the school and send them to the authors of the present\narticle.\nData Processing\nThe data from the questionnaires were processed using\ndescriptive and inferential statistics: frequency distribution\n(f, f%) of attributive variables, basic descriptive statistics of\nnumerical variables (mean, standard deviation), the Kullback\n2\u00ce test (because the condition of the theoretical frequencies\nfor the chi-square test was not fulfilled), Levene's test for\nequality of variances (F test), the t test. Factor analysis was\nalso undertaken: the major components method, Varimax\nrotation, and multiple regression for analysis of the relation-\nship between a single dependent variable and multiple inde-\npendent variables, in which the method of least squares was\nused and all of the selected variables were simultaneously\nincorporated in the model (Enter method). The data are pre-\nsented in tabular form. The percentages are calculated on\nTable 2.

Over\ntime, good self-evaluation evolves in a continuous process of\nimproving operational and organizational quality and effi-\nciency, significantly affecting all aspects of the life and work\nof the school. Furthermore, the research showed that the\nmajority of the respondents were aware of the importance of\nthe performance of self-evaluation. Although the responses\nof different groups of respondents to this question showed a\n.000), the majority of the respondents replied that they per-\nceived conducting self-evaluation as important or very\nimportant for their profession. In the present research, the\ngroup with the largest proportion of respondents who believe\nthat conducting self-evaluation is important or very impor-\ntant is primary-school headteachers (89.7%), followed by\nsecondary-school headteachers (86.2%), primary-school\nwhile the share of secondary-school counselors (66.7%) and\nsecondary-school teachers (66.4%) who share such opinions\nis slightly lower (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015).\nFor headteachers, teachers, and school counselors to be\nable to explore pedagogical practice and effectively carry out\nself-evaluation, it is assumed that they possess appropriate\nmethodological knowledge in addition to knowledge of their\narea of expertise. Headteachers, teachers, and school coun-\nselors evaluated their ability to set the goals of self-evalua-\ntion (content planning, what to evaluate), its methodological\ndesign (research plan, sample, data collection process, etc.),\nthe development of instruments for data collection, data pro-\ncessing, interpretation of the results, report writing, and\ninforming the public (teachers, parents, etc.) of findings, as\nwell as their ability to plan improvements of school practice\nbasedonthefindingsofself-evaluationresearch.Respondents\nwere asked to assess their ability to perform specific activi-\nties within self-evaluation process, with the Grade 5 indicat-\ning a very good level of qualification, and the Grade 1\nreflecting a very poor level of qualification (Table 4).\nPedagogical workers from primary school gave the high-\nest rating to their ability to write reports on the findings of\nself-evaluation, followed by their ability to interpret results,\nto inform the public (teachers, parents, etc.) about the find-\nings, to set goals and plan the content of the self-evaluation,\nand to process the collected data. Pedagogical workers from\nsecondary school feel most qualified to interpret the results\nand to set goals or plan the self-evaluation regarding content.\nBoth pedagogical workers from primary and secondary\nschool assigned the lowest rating to their ability to devise\ninstruments for data collection, and their ability to undertake\nthe methodological planning of self-evaluation (research\nplan, sample, data collection process, etc.).\nAs professionals, teachers cannot be mere implementers\nof decisions; they should participate actively in the formula-\ntion and adoption of decisions, and in the evaluation of their\nimplementation (Niemi & Jakku-Sihvonen, 2006). The edu-\ncation of teachers based on a culture of research follows\nfrom the assumption that teachers should be trained to moni-\ntor and critically evaluate new findings and achievements of\nsciences that are important for their professional conduct as\nwell as for self-studying, developing and evaluating teach-\ning. According to MacBeath (2011), a paradigm shift from a\npassive and subordinate role to an active role takes place,\nwith educators becoming the primary initiators of self-evalu-\nation and taking responsibility for their individual and col-\nlective professional development.\nUsing factor analysis, the present study established which\nfactors affect the frequency of performing self-evaluation.\nSome 22 variables were included in the factor analysis, that is,\n22 statements with regard to which the respondents indicated\nthe extent of their agreement. The respondents were asked to\nassess their opinions on a 5-point Likert-type scale, on which\nby selecting the rating 5 the respondent strongly agrees with\nthe statement, whereas by selecting the rating 1 the respondent\nstrongly disagrees with the statement (Table 5).\nThe outcomes of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and\nBartlett's test showed the factorization to be reasonable and\njustified (Table 6).\nAfter the extraction of the factors, they were rotated\naccording to the Varimax (orthogonal rotation) and oblimin\n(oblique rotation) methods. Based on Thurstone's simple\nstructure criteria, we decided that the Varimax rotation was\nthe better solution, as the structure is simpler and more trans-\nparent according to this rotation.\nFour factors account for 60.523% of the total variance:\n31.970% of the variance was explained by the first factor,\nFour factors were obtained (Table 7). Based on the contex-\ntual characteristics, they were named as follows: (a) positive\neffects of self-evaluation (this factor comprises statements\nshowing the attitude of the respondents toward self-evalua-\ntion and their opinions regarding the positive effects of carry-\ning out self-evaluation), (b) school climate (this factor consists\nof statements relating to the climate in the institution, the atti-\ntude of colleagues and the headteacher toward a teacher who\nconducts surveys and takes part in research projects, etc.), (c)\nthe attitude of teachers toward research (this factor consists of\nstatements that relate to the attitude of the respondents toward\nthe survey, the publishing of articles in which they present the\nfindings of the empirical research to inform the wider profes-\nsional public about their work, etc.), (d) the professional\ndevelopment of teachers (the fourth factor consists of vari-\nables referring to the respondents' attitude toward their pro-\nfessional development; it also comprises a variable that\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 5.

The frequency of\nPodgornik and Vogrinc 9\nself-evaluation was assessed on an annual basis, regardless of\nthe content area in which self-evaluation was carried out (e.g.,\nthe effectiveness of approaches to teaching, establishing the\nclassroom discipline, classroom climate, etc.).Amodel was for-\nmulated with multiple regression analysis using the method of\nleast squares, with all of the variables being simultaneously\nincluded in the model (the Enter method).\nThe determination coefficient (R2) shows that the obtained\nregression model accounted for 7.4% of the variance. The\nANOVA value was statistically significant (F = 28.228,  =\n.000), which means that the presented model significantly\nimproves the forecast of the frequency of carrying out self-\nevaluation (Table 9).\nThe model shows (Table 10) that the frequency of per-\nforming self-evaluation is statistically significantly influ-\nenced by the following factors: the opinion of teachers on the\npositive effects of self-evaluation, the school climate, and the\nattitude of teachers toward their own professional develop-\nment. Based on the statistical significance of the t values, it\ncan be concluded that the frequency of performance of self-\nevaluation is most strongly affected by the attitude of teach-\ners toward their professional development, followed by their\nopinion on the positive effects of self-evaluation; the weak-\nest, but still statistically significant, link is between the fre-\nquency of the performance of self-evaluation and the opinion\nof teachers on the school climate regarding the performance\nof a self-evaluation.\nConclusion\nThe empirical research showed that among headteachers,\nteachers, and counselors there are statistically significant dif-\nferences in their opinions on the importance of self-evalua-\ntion for their profession. Despite the fact that all the groups\nof respondents viewed conducting self-evaluation to be\nimportant for their profession, the primary-school headteach-\ners (89.7%) were most convinced of its importance, whereas\nthe secondary-school teachers (66.4%) were least convinced\nof its importance. Elementary and secondary pedagogical\nworkers estimate that during the various stages of the imple-\nmentation of self-evaluation studies they are best qualified\nfor the interpretation of the results, for report writing, setting\nthe self-evaluation goals (content planning, what to evaluate)\nand for informing the public (teachers, parents, etc.) of the\nfindings. The empirical research shows that the frequency of\nperformance of self-evaluation is most strongly affected by\nthe attitudes of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors\ntoward their professional development, followed by their\nopinion on the positive effects of self-evaluation.\nFor teachers to perceive the performance of self-evalua-\ntion as a permanent and important professional task that is a\nprerequisite to successful quality assessment and assurance,\nit is necessary to create the appropriate climate in schools,\nenabling each pedagogical worker to pursue research work\nand perform self-evaluation, and ultimately encouraging\nthem to do so. The key factors that influence the creation of\nsuch a school climate are: mutual trust, understanding and\ncooperation between the employed pedagogical workers,\npersonal assistance and professional support, and open com-\nmunication. In addition, it is important for teachers to feel\nthat their work is appreciated and that their proposals, ideas,\nadvice and the like are accepted in good faith and taken into\naccount by their colleagues. Teachers should also be able to\nturn to their colleagues or the headteacher if needed. Based\non the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that\ngood conditions for research and the performance of self-\nevaluation have been established in Slovenian schools: Most\nof the respondents judge that their colleagues accept their\nideas, advice, and so on, that pedagogical workers cooperate\nwell at their school and help each other, that the professional\nperformance of teachers is appreciated in collective bodies,\nand that a teacher wanting to introduce a specific innovation\nin the teaching at their school can count on the moral support\nof the headteacher.\nSome authors (e.g., MacBeath, 2011; Vanhoof, Van\nPetegem, Verhoeven, & Buvens, 2009) consider that school\nshould establish and develop a culture of learning, that is, a\n\"Learning Network,\" which involves cooperation, learning,\nsharing of knowledge, views, experiences, and so on between\neducation practitioners. Teachers should be able to connect\nand engage with their counterparts from other schools, with\nexternal experts, and so on. It is also necessary to include\nstudents and their parents in the processes of quality assess-\nment and assurance, as different views are appreciated in dis-\ncussions on the findings of self-evaluation and on the\nfollow-up measures. This does not mean that representatives\nof all stakeholders should be involved in making decisions\nall the time, but they should be included where necessary and\nappropriate (taking into account their knowledge, experi-\nence, possession of information, etc.). It is recommended\nthat a special team of teachers should be established to carry\nout self-evaluation at school, with a core mission of planning\nand carrying out self-evaluation within a specified time\nperiod. On the basis of prior joint decisions (of all pedagogi-\ncal workers) about the priorities and substantive areas of\nself-evaluation, such a group should provide a self-evalua-\ntion research plan and decide on the methodology of work,\nthe selection of predesigned instruments and/or the creation\nof new instruments (for the needs of the specific research). It\nshould collect data, analyze and interpret data, and, when the\nresearch is concluded, draw up a report on the research\nTable 6.

External experts may provide professional assis-\ntance and support (regarding content and methodology) to\nthe school in the process of carrying out self-evaluation.\nSome authors (e.g., Lunenberg, Ponte, & Van de Ven, 2007;\nof linking researchers and practitioners to achieve the com-\nmon objective, that is, to establish a school system of the\nhighest possible quality.\nMany authors (e.g., Burton & Bartlett, 2005; Cochran-\nthat the research work of teachers is a highly effective way\nof promoting their professional development, while also\ncontributing to an improved reputation/status of the teach-\ning profession in public. Research promotes the develop-\nment of the critical and analytical abilities of teachers,\nenabling them to critically reflect on their work, gain\nknowledge and experience of research work, become\nfamiliar with new insights into theory and practice, and so\non. The research work of teachers has a positive impact on\nteaching and learning, and it is strongly associated with the\nintroduction of innovations and changes into teaching\npractice. Teacher-researchers can also use their knowledge\nand experience to help their colleagues and to contribute\nsignificantly to the development of the school as a whole,\nwhile practitioners' research contributes important new\ninsights into education.\nEducators should also possess at least a basic knowledge\nof methodology to be able to systematically monitor and ana-\nlyze their own practice, as well as to use the lessons learned\nin their future work. Learning content related to the method-\nological planning and carrying out of self-evaluation should\nbe integrated into courses dealing with the subject matter in\nthe field of research (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015). Learning\ncontent pertaining to quality assessment and assurance in\neducation should be addressed in other subjects, as well.\nIn this respect, interdisciplinary seminars designed to help\nstudents make sense of methodological knowledge, and to\nconnect research with the pursuit of other professional activi-\nties, can be of great benefit (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015).\nWe believe that this should be taken into account when\ndesigning study programs (in all three cycles: undergraduate,\nmaster's, and doctoral studies) for future teachers and other\neducation professionals, as well as when formulating con-\ntinuing education programs and training for education\nprofessionals.\nTo achieve the highest possible level of quality of educa-\ntional work, it is particularly important that all education\nprofessionals in schools, especially headteachers, constantly\nseek to establish and maintain a school climate that in its core\nsupports individual professional development and the devel-\nopment of the school as a whole.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.
