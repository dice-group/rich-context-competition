    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhereas women of all ages prefer slightly older sexual partners, men--regardless of their age--have a preference for women in\ntheir 20s. Earlier research has suggested that this difference between the sexes' age preferences is resolved according to women's\npreferences. This research has not, however, sufficiently considered that the age range of considered partners might change over\nthe life span. Here we investigated the age limits (youngest and oldest) of considered and actual sex partners in a population-based\nsample of 2,655 adults (aged 18-50 years). Over the investigated age span, women reported a narrower age range than men and\nwomen tended to prefer slightly older men. We also show that men's age range widens as they get older: While they continue to\nconsider sex with young women, men also consider sex with women their own age or older. Contrary to earlier suggestions,\nmen's sexual activity thus reflects also their own age range, although their potential interest in younger women is not likely\nconverted into sexual activity. Compared to homosexual men, bisexual and heterosexual men were more unlikely to convert\nyoung preferences into actual behavior, supporting female-choice theory.\n",

In their seminal\npaper, Kenrick and Keefe (1992) showed that men's and\nwomen's sexual age preferences have different developmental\ntrajectories. As a person grows older, the person's sexual age\npreferences tend to change, and, as a general rule, the age of\ndesirable partners also increases. The magnitude of this\nincrease differs between the sexes. For women, a year's\nincrease in her own age is relatively closely matched to a\nsimilar increase in the desired partners' age. Women tend to\nprefer partners who are similar to or somewhat older than they\nthemselves are (e.g., Kenrick & Keefe, 1992). Men, on the\nother hand, clearly age faster than their desired partners, and\na year's increase in his own age is accompanied by a smaller\nincrease in the desired partner's age (e.g., Antfolk et al., 2015).\nYoung men (aged < 20 years) are interested in somewhat older\npartners than themselves, but as time passes and men age, the\ninterest in partners in their mid-20s is maintained. The result is\nthat older men tend to be interested in women younger than\nthemselves (Antfolk et al., 2015; Kenrick, Gabrielidis, Keefe,\n& Cornelius, 1996). Generally speaking, earlier studies suggest\nthat heterosexual men--irrespective of their own age--are\nattracted to women in their 20s and that very few men are\nexclusively interested in very young or very old women (e.g.,\ndemonstrated in modern Western and non-Western cultures\naccompanied by some indirect evidence from hunter-gatherer\nindustrial societies (e.g., Dribe & Lundh, 2009). Studies have\nused various measures, including surveys (Antfolk et al., 2015;\n1 Department of Psychology, A\n\u00b0 bo Akademi University, Turku, Finland\nCorresponding Author:\nJan Antfolk, Department of Psychology, A\n\u00b0 bo Akademi University, Tehtaankatu\nEmail: jantfolk@abo.fi\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/evp\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n1999), marriage announcements (Otta, da Silva Queiroz, de\nSousa Campos, Dowbor Da Silva, & Telles Silveira, 1999),\nonline chat rooms (Bergen, Antfolk, Jern, Alanko, & Sant-\ntila, 2013), and by investigating earnings by prostitutes\n(Sohn, 2016). In this context, it is also important to separate\nbetween studies investigating sexual interest, actual sexual\nbehavior, or age disparity in long-term relationships. Age\ndisparity in long-term relationships is likely a compromise\nbetween both women's and men's interests (although the\nrelative weight of these two interests likely differ across\ncultural contexts). This is also true for sexual behavior. Sex,\nin most cases, necessitates that the sexual interest of two\nindividuals overlap. For example, studies looking at mar-\nriage announcements will be informative regarding age dis-\nparity in relationships and provide only limited information\nregarding differences in sexual interest. For example,\nBuunk, Dijkstra, Kenrick, and Wrantjes (2001) showed that\nmen prefer older partners for short-term versus long-term\nmating, suggesting that age preferences depend on the\namount of involvement. A similar finding was later pre-\nsented in a study by Young, Critelli, and Keith (2005).\nHeterosexual women's sexual interest in slightly older\nmen has been explained as reflecting the human bi-\nmaturation process, by which females mature earlier than\nmales (van den Berghe, 1992), and/or as a trade-off\nbetween the increased social dominance and the decrease\nin remaining life span in older men (Antfolk et al., 2015).\nThat heterosexual men's sexual age preferences is focused\nat women in their 20s has been explained as the evolution-\nary consequence of this age being associated with high\nfemale fecundity and peak copulation to conception ratios\nThe risk for miscarriages and chromosomal abnormalities\nin the offspring also becomes approximately 10 times\nhigher in 40-year-old mothers compared to 25-year-old\nincrease is paired with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric\ndisorders such as autism in offspring (Shelton, Tancredi, &\nA female partner's age is thus associated with men's\nprobability of producing offspring (and this offspring being\nhealthy), and men who prefer sex with relatively old\nwomen would thus have left relatively few allele copies\nto future generations. To the extent these alleles are asso-\nciated with sexual age preferences, such preferences would\nbecome decreasingly rare in the population (e.g., Kenrick &\nWhat about sexual age preferences in homosexual (vs. het-\nerosexual) men and women? Studies on this topic suggest that\nage preferences in homosexual individuals are largely similar\nto those of heterosexual individuals: Like their heterosexual\ncounterparts, homosexual men show a tendency to be sexually\ninterested in young men and homosexual women show a ten-\ndency to be interested in women in their own age range (Hayes,\nverthorne & Quinsey, 2000). These findings have been taken\nto support the modularity hypothesis of sexual orientation. The\nmodularity hypothesis (e.g., Symons, 1979) explains homo-\nsexuality as different from heterosexuality only with respect\nto the sex of the desired partner and suggests that homosexual\nand heterosexual individuals show similar patterns regarding\nother aspects of sexual psychology. Thus, no differences in age\npreferences would be expected based on sexual orientation\nalone. Very little is known about age preferences in bisexuals.\nA study by Adam (2000) suggests, however, that both homo-\nsexual men and bisexual men display the same interest in\nyoung partners as heterosexual men do.\nAnother, related observation is that both heterosexual\nmen's and heterosexual women's actual sexual behavior is\npredicted by women's sexual age preferences, and much\nless by men's sexual age preferences (Kenrick & Keefe,\n1992). This finding has been explained as a function of\nfemale choice. Parental investment theory (Trivers, 1972)\npredicts that women are choosier than men with respect to\nthe characteristics of a potential sexual partner. The reason\nfor this is that women invest more than men in pregnancy,\nchild birth, and nurturing a child and therefore invest more\nenergy in the case of a pregnancy--a very possible conse-\nquence of sex (Trivers, 1972). If female choosiness explains\nthe discrepancy between heterosexual men's preferences\nand actual behavior, a different pattern ought to emerge in\nhomosexual and heterosexual men. Homosexual men seek to\nmate mainly with other men, and, if these men are less\nchoosy than women, homosexual men's sexual interest\nwould more likely be converted into actual behavior. Hence,\nin the context of sexual interest, no large differences in age\npreferences is expected, but in the context of sexual beha-\nvior, homosexual men are expected to have younger sexual\npartners compared to heterosexual men.\nOne limitation in previous research is that scholars have\nfocused on either the most desirable age of partners or a\nmore abstract \"mean age preference.\" This approach has at\nleast two limitations: it does not appropriately consider the\nrange of an individual's age preferences, as it assumes that\nthe upper age limit and the lower age limit change similarly\nover the life span. Neglecting to look at the upper and lower\nlimits separately may therefore bias the results and lead to\nwrongful conclusions. More specifically, this approach may\nlead to overlooking the possibility that men's age prefer-\nences widen over the years and that heterosexual men there-\nfore also are sexually interested in the (older) women they\ntend to have sex with.\nThe Current Study\nIn the current study, the aim was to expand on earlier find-\nings on sexual age preferences by investigating the age\nlimits representing the youngest and oldest individuals that\nmen and women could consider having sex with. We\nexpected (i) both women's youngest and oldest considered\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nsex partners to be strongly and positively associated with\ntheir own age. For men, we expected the oldest considered\nsex partners would be strongly positively associated with\ntheir own age, but that the youngest considered partners would\nshow a weaker association with their own age. In other words,\nwe expected men to throughout their life maintain an interest\nin young women while also becoming interested in older and\nolder women. We also aimed to (ii) replicate the finding that\nactual sexual behavior in heterosexual men and heterosexual\nwomen is more closely predicted by women's interests com-\npared to men's interests. Moreover, we aimed to investigate\nthe effects of sexual orientation on age-related sexual interest\nand sexual activity. In line with previous literature, we\nexpected that (iii) sexual orientation (within one sex) would\nnot be strongly associated with the age of considered partners.\nAs a further test of the female choice theory, we, however,\nalso aimed to test the expectation that (iv) actual sexual beha-\nvior would not be as strongly associated with the age of con-\nsidered partners in heterosexual men as it is in homosexual\nmen. We also explored age preferences in bisexual men\nand women.\nMethod\nParticipants\nOur final sample included observations from 2,676 individuals.\nanalyses were between 18 and 50 years old (see Figure 3 in\nAppendix for frequencies of participants across age and sex).\nData were obtained from the Finn-Kin data collection\n(Albrecht et al., 2014), which contains a population-based sam-\nple of people living in Finland. This data collection was the\nresult of inviting a randomized sample of individuals aged 18\u00ad\n49 to participate in an online survey of sex and family-related\ntopics. Invitations were sent out, obtaining addresses from the\ncentral Population Registry of Finland that keeps information\nabout all individuals residing in Finland. Due to differences in\nresponse rates, more women than men participated in the sur-\nvey. (For more details on this data collection, see Albrecht\nMeasures\nParticipants' age. Participants reported their age using a\ndrop-down menu with answer options between 18 and 99\nyears of age.\nSexual orientation. To categorize individuals as homosexual,\nbisexual, or heterosexual, we summed the responses to two\nvariables measuring sexual behavior with or sexual interest in\nindividuals of the same and opposite sexes. The reason to sum\nresponses across both actual behavior and interest was that\nbehavior is not always the result of interest. By summing\nvariables, both interest and behavior could be considered and\ngiven equal weight. Thus, the responses to the two questions \"if\nthere was a scale from heterosexual to homosexual, regarding\nsexual behavior/erotic attraction\" where would you place your-\nself on this scale\" were summed. Individuals with the sum\nvalue 2 (lowest possible value) were coded as \"heterosexual\"\n\"bisexual\" (n \u00bc 900), and individuals with values above 4 were\ncoded as \"homosexual\" (n \u00bc 171).\nThe age of the youngest and oldest considered sex partner. Parti-\ncipants reported the age of the youngest and oldest considered\nsexual partner using a drop-down menu (answer options ranged\nbetween 0 and 99) to answer the following questions: \"With\nhow young a person could you consider having sex?\" and\n\"With how old a person could you consider having sex?\"\nThe age of the youngest and oldest actual sex partner. Participants\nreported the age of the youngest and oldest sex partner they had\nduring the last 5 years. They used a drop-down menu (answer\noptions ranged between 0 and 99) to answer the following\nquestions: \"With how young a person have you had sex during\nthe last 5 years?\" and \"With how old a person have you had sex\nduring the last 5 years?\" (see Appendix for Swedish versions of\nthe questions).\nStatistical Analyses\nWe first expected the variables of interest for possible out-\nliers. Because our data included some extreme values (e.g.,\nobservations above 99 or younger than 10 years of age), we\nremoved these observations (3.1%, n \u00bc 86) from the data file.\nWe decided to also include young teenagers to capture possi-\nble hebephilic interest. Although some observations remained\noutside the 95% confidence intervals of the mean, we consid-\nered it possible that these observations were true observations\nof the natural variation in age preferences (e.g., young respon-\ndents displaying interest in young teenagers or old respon-\ndents displaying an interest in older individuals) and chose\nto keep them in the data file. The very low number of such\nextreme observations would also not affect our main findings\nin any major way. We also removed participants who reported\nbeing older (0.4%, n \u00bc 11) than the actual age limits for the\nsampling frame (i.e., above 50 years old [50-year-olds were\nincluded, because some individuals who was 49 years old at\nthe time of sampling could have turned 50 before respond-\ning]). Thus, the original sample size (n \u00bc 2,773) was reduced\ninto its current size.\nResults\nDescriptive Results\nA one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that female\nparticipants differed in age across the groups of sexual orienta-\nOne-way ANOVAs also showed significant differences\nbetween groups of sexual orientation in female participants\np < .05, considered sex partners as well as for youngest,\npartners. For male participants, there was a significant dif-\nference between the groups of sexual orientation for youngest,\nences were again significant (Table 1).\nThe Association Between Participant Age and the Age of\nConsidered Sex Partners\nWe then inspected the distribution of data across participant\nage. This was first done by calculating the probability (propor-\ntion of participants of a given age considering sex with a part-\nner of a certain age/number of participants of that given age)\nthat a partner would be included in the range of considered\npartners, while accounting for both the participants' and the\npartners' ages. For heterosexual male and female participants,\nthe distribution is visualized in Figure 1.\nThe relatively larger green area on the right panel compared\nto the left panel in Figure 1 indicated that heterosexual female\nparticipants were, on average, more likely to not consider sex\nwith men of certain ages than vice versa. Indeed, the probabil-\nity that female participants of a certain age could consider sex\nwith men of a certain age was below .33 in 36.5% of the\nincluded ages and above .66 in only 44.4% of the included\nages. The probability that heterosexual male participants of a\ncertain age could consider sex with women of a certain age was\nas much as 68.0% of the included ages.\nConsidered and Actual Sex Partners by Participant Sex,\nAge, and Sexual Orientation\nTo investigate the associations between participant age and the\nage of concerning considered and actual sex partners, we con-\nducted a set of linear regressions. Here we conducted separate\nregressions for the three groups of sexual orientation within\nboth male and female participants. All associations were pos-\nitive, and all but two associations were statistically significant\n(see Table 2 and Figure 2).\nThe age of the youngest considered sex partner increased\nwith the age of the participant in all groups apart from homo-\nsexual male participants. In homosexual male participants, the\nage of the youngest considered sex partner remained the same\nacross the measured life span. A comparison of confidence\nintervals revealed that in bisexual and heterosexual male parti-\ncipants, the age-related incline for age of the youngest consid-\nered sex partner was steeper than in homosexual male\nparticipants. At the same time, the age-related incline in all\nmale groups was not as steep as in the female groups. Within\nfemale participants, there were no noteworthy differences\nbetween groups of sexual orientation.\nThe age of the oldest considered sex partner increased with\nthe age of the participant in all groups. Although the age-\nrelated incline differed statistically between heterosexual and\nbisexual male participants (slightly more horizontal) and het-\nerosexual and bisexual female participants (slightly more\nvertical), the difference was small. No other differences\nwere observed.\nFemale participants' youngest and oldest considered sex\npartners were strongly and positively associated with their own\nage. For male participants, the age of the oldest considered sex\npartners was strongly positively associated with their own age.\nIn the case of youngest considered partners, a weaker associa-\ntion with participant age was found.\nThe age of the youngest actual sex partner also increased\nwith the age of the participant in all groups. Although there\nwere some small differences in the age-related incline between\nmale and female participants, the incline was similar in all\ngroups apart from homosexual men. Homosexual men showed\na less steep age-related incline than any other group. This sug-\ngests that among male participants, sexual behavior was most\nlikely to reflect a preference for young partners in the homo-\nsexual group.\nThe age-related incline for oldest actual sex partner was\nstrong in all participant groups and no noteworthy differences\nwere found.\nTable 1.

Values represent mean age and its standard deviation (within parenthesis).\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nFemale Choice: Converting Interest Into Behavior\nAs a final test of female choice, we tested whether homosexual\nmen would be more likely than heterosexual male participants\nto show a high correlation between the age of the youngest\nconsidered sex partner and their youngest actual sex partner.\nWe investigated this by first calculating the partial correlation\nbetween youngest considered sex partner and youngest actual\nsex partner while controlling for own age. The partial correla-\ntion between youngest imagined age and youngest actual part-\nner was weaker in heterosexual male participants (r \u00bc .224,\nin homosexual male participants (r \u00bc .540, p < .01).\nFigure 1.

CI \u00bc confidence interval.\nDiscussion\nIn the current study, we investigated the youngest and oldest\nconsidered age for a sex partner and the youngest and oldest\nage of a recent actual sex partner. Our population-based sample\nof 2,655 individuals included both male and female partici-\npants. Participants of both sexes were grouped as heterosexual,\nbisexual, and homosexual.\nWe expected to find patterns similar to previous studies\nshowing that women's youngest and oldest considered sex\npartners are strongly associated with their own age. For men,\nhowever, we expected that only the oldest considered age\nwould be strongly associated with their own age, but that the\nyoungest considered age would show a weaker association with\ntheir own age.\nIn line with earlier studies, we found that the sexual\nage preferences change as a person ages, and that this\nchange is different between men and women. The major\ndifference between male and female participants related\nto the age of the youngest considered sex partner. In\nfemale participants, the youngest considered sex partner\naged with an average of 4.5 months each year. In male\nparticipants this number was lower and the youngest con-\nsidered sex partner aged with only 2 months each year.\nDue to different starting points, this means that the\nyoungest considered age of a sex partner differed by as\nmuch as 11 years between 50 years old male and female\nparticipants. With respect to the oldest considered age of a\nsex partner, there were only small differences between the\nsexes. When taking the upper age limit into account, it\nbecomes clear that men's sexual preferences also can explain\nmen's sexual activity. Indeed, very few male participants\nreported having sex with individuals they would consider too\nold. This means that a comparison of men's and women's\nage preferences and sexual behavior does not, as such, lend\nconclusive support to the notion that heterosexual men's sex-\nual behavior is restricted by female choice.\nFigure 2. Youngest and oldest considered and actual sex partners by participant age, sex, and sexual orientation. Partners' ages are presented\non the Y-axis and the participant's age is presented on the X-axis. The black line is the reference line (Y \u00bc X).\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nWe also investigated the effects of sexual orientation (het-\nerosexual vs. homosexual) on sexual age preferences and sex-\nual activity. We expected homosexual and heterosexual\nindividuals within one sex to have similar age preferences.\nIndeed, the age limits were very similar between groups of\nsexual orientation within both sexes. We also investigated\nwhether actual sexual behavior with young partners corre-\nlated more strongly with an interest in young individuals in\nhomosexual male participants than in heterosexual male par-\nticipants. Homosexual male participants reported a closer\nmatch between behavior and preferences than heterosexual\nmale participants. This strongly suggests that women's sex-\nual interest constrain men's behavior on the heterosexual\nmating market.\nBisexual male and female participants reported similar\npreferences as heterosexual male and female participants.\nBefore drawing any conclusions based on these patterns, it\nis important to note that the operational definition of\n\"bisexual\" included also individuals reporting low levels of\nsexual interest in same-sex individuals. These individuals\nmight consider themselves heterosexual or \"bicurious\" and\nmight differ from individuals who more precisely fit the term\n\"bisexual.\" Given the lack of research on age preferences in\nbisexual individuals, the results of the current provide novel,\nbut tentative, information.\nThe current study was conducted in Finland, a modern,\nindustrialized society high in gender equality (World Eco-\nnomic Forum, 2015). Studies have shown that populations\nwith high gender equality tend to be low in sexual dimorph-\nism (e.g., Manning, Fink, & Trivers, 2014). In the current\ncontext of age preferences, this could mean that on average\nthe difference between men and women is smaller than in\nother, less equal, populations. At the same time, there is\nevidence of women maturing earlier in more industrialized\n(vs. less industrialized) societies (Parent et al., 2003). This\nwould also mean that Finnish women tend to show physical\nsigns of maturation at a relatively young age. This could\nmean that Finnish men, on average, are interested in\nslightly younger women than men are in less industrialized\nand less gender equal societies. With this in mind, cross-\ncultural data on the development of age preferences across\nthe life span could elucidate potential variability over dif-\nferent social contexts.\nThe current study focused on sexual interest. Romantic\ninterest or preferences for long-term partners were not mea-\nsured. This is important to consider, because reproduction in\nmost cases occur within the stability of a long-term pair bond\n(e.g., Gray & Garcia, 2013). This means that the choice of a\nlong-term partner is likely a more important evolutionary factor\nto consider when uncovering the selection pressure on age-\nrelated sexual preferences.\nA final thing to consider is that age is only one of many\ncharacteristics evaluated in a potential partner. In fact, age is\nlikely not very important in itself but acts as a proxy for several\nother important factors. These factors include, for example,\nremaining life span, fertility (in women), health, and status.\nAge also affects other aspects of sexuality. For example, sexual\ndesire decreases as humans grow older and more so in women\ncompared to men (e.g., DeLamater & Sill, 2004). This age-\nrelated sex discrepancy in sexual desire in older men and\nwomen (compared to young men and women), with sexual\ndesire being higher in men compared to women, could\ndrive men to \"strategically\" widen their age limits as they\ngrow older.\nLimitations of the Current Study\nOne limitation in our study is a possible skewing of data\nregarding youngest actual partner for our youngest\nrespondents. Given that the mean age of first intercourse\nin Finland is approximately 17.5 years for both sexes\nare likely to report that their youngest partner during the\nlast 5 years was, on average, 17 years old. These observa-\ntions, however, represent the true limit and do not invalidate\nour conclusions.\nIt is also important to note that we did not include men\nor women older than 50 years of age in the current study.\nAlthough there is relatively little data on age preferences\nin older age-groups, we predict that the difference\nbetween ages continues to grow as men and women age.\nNevertheless, this prediction is not tested in the current\nstudy, and we hope future studies are designed to test\nthis claim.\nConclusions and Future Directions\nThe results of this study indicate that men's and women's\nsexual age preferences develop differently. As women grow\nolder, age limits regarding both younger and older sex part-\nners follow their own aging. As men grow older, they\nbecome interested in older individuals but maintain an inter-\nest in younger individuals. Homosexual men are more likely\nthan heterosexual men to convert a preference for young\nindividuals into actual sexual behavior, supporting female-\nchoice theory.\nWe also found that homosexual male participants differed\nfrom other male participants regarding the youngest consid-\nered age. Although this difference was small, this collateral\nfinding could suggest that men interested in women self-\nmodulate their preferences to better fit the interest of their\npotential female partners. This finding is tentative and studies\ndesigned to test this hypothesis are necessary before any con-\nclusions can be drawn.\nAlthough participants' own age explained a large propor-\ntion of the variance in age preferences and sexual behavior,\nwe note that an interesting aspect remains unexplored:\nBetween-individual variation (while controlling for age dif-\nferences) in understanding the differences in both prefer-\nences and behavior have not received a lot of attention in\nthe literature.\nAppendix\nMeasures and Questions in Swedish\nSexual orientation.\n\u00a8r det ga\n\u00a8ller sexuellt beteende] Om det skulle finnas\nen skala fra\n\u00b0n heterosexuell till homosexuell, var skulle\ndu placera dig sja\n\u00a8lv?\n\u00a8r det ga\n\u00a8ller erotisk attraktion] Om det skulle finnas\nen skala fra\n\u00b0n heterosexuell till homosexuell, var skulle\ndu placera dig sja\n\u00a8lv?\nThe age of the youngest and oldest considered and actual sex\npartner.\n1.
