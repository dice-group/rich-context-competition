Tager, Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley,\nThe authors evaluated the association between ambient ozone levels and cardiac mortality in California's South\nCoast Air Basin during the period 1983\u00ad2000 and compared inferences from several types of marginal structural\nmodel (MSM) estimators. The authors undertook an ecologic study during the high-ozone seasons among persons\nover age 55 years. In contrast to conditional regression analysis and MSMs based on G-computation and simple\ninverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW), an MSM that protected against violation of the experimental\ntreatment assignment (ETA) assumption and considered only those areas that could have experienced both high\nand low ozone concentrations during 1983\u00ad2000 found no consistent evidence that reductions in quarterly 1-hour\nmaximum ozone concentrations from levels above any of the regulatory standards to levels below those standards\nled to decreases in cardiac mortality; however, it did find evidence of decreases related to a decrease in 8-hour\nmaximum concentrations. The G-computation estimator and simple IPTW estimators were biased because of\nserious violation of the ETA assumption. These analyses highlight the importance of nonviolation of the ETA\nassumption for valid inference and the failure of conditional regression to provide marginal estimates in the\npresence of interactions. Noncausal models also consistently inferred larger associations, which may have been\ndue to bias violation of the ETA assumption on which these models rely.\nair pollution; cardiovascular diseases; epidemiologic methods; ozone\nAbbreviations: ETA, experimental treatment assignment; HRCMIER, history-restricted causal models for realistic individualized\nexposure rules; HRMSM, history-restricted marginal structural models; IPTW, inverse probability-of-treatment weighting; PM2.5\n,\nparticulate matter 2.5 lm in diameter; PM10\n, particulate matter 10 lm in diameter.\nAssociations between daily variation in ambient ozone con-\ncentrations and mortality have been reported since the early\nbient Air Quality Standards (9) and a recent report from the\nNational Research Council (10) have recognized the associa-\ntion between ozone and mortality, based primarily on the re-\nanalyses (2 time series, 1 cohort) have raised the possibility\nthatthesemortalityassociationsmaybeconfounded,atleastin\npart, by particulate matter and its constituents (13\u00ad15).\nDespite this accumulated evidence for associations be-\ntween ambient ozone concentrations and mortality, there\nis a need for more investigation, especially single studies\nof multiple areas (11).

The population's exposure was estimated from ambient\nair quality measurements obtained from a network of stations\nthat began monitoring air quality before 1980 (Figure 1).\nQuarterly average concentrations of 1-hour daily maximum\nozone and 24-hour average nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide,\nand carbon monoxide were compiled from hourly measure-\nments.

We removed 31 outcome\noutliers from grids with small numbers of persons; removal\ndid not affect our inferences.\nFor a detailed description of the data structure, see Moore\net al. (17). In short, we denote the observed data structure by\nO \u00bc ( \nY(72)), where 1) the history of ozone\nis denoted by \nrepresents the ozone concentration measured at time t;\n2) the history of cardiac mortality as a percentage of\nthe total area-specific population is denoted by \n(Y(1); . . . ; Y(72)), and Y(t) represents the mortality pro-\nportion measured at time t; and 3) the history of potential\ntime-dependent confounders of the effect of ozone on cardiac\nmortality is denoted by \nW\u00f0K\u00de \u00bc \u00f0W\u00f00\u00de; . . . ; W\u00f071\u00de\u00de, where\nW(t) is a multivariate vector of potential confounders (demo-\ngraphic variables, copollutants, and meteorologic variables)\nmeasured at time t (Web Table 2). Since we are considering\nthe effect of ozone on cardiac mortality during quarters 2 and\n3, we have 36 outcomes of interest.\nThe exposure variable, denoted by A*(t), is defined as an\nindicator for whether the continuous ozone concentration\nvariable A(t) falls above a particular cutpoint (i.e., regula-\ntory standard). Thus, for any given grid, A*(t) \u00bc 1 indicates\na high ozone concentration and A*(t) \u00bc 0 indicates\na low ozone concentration.\nStatistical models\nThe goal of the analysis was to estimate the causal effect\nof lowering ozone concentrations from levels above various\nozone standards that have been considered in the regulatory\nprocess to levels below those standards on the proportion of\ndeaths from cardiac disease--that is, the effect of A*(t) on\nY(t). We were interested in investigating whether this effect\nwas modified by time. We investigated this effect separately\nfor each of 3 exposure variables that were defined on the\nbasis of 3 cutpoints delineating ``high'' ozone concentra-\ntions versus ``low'' ozone concentrations: 70 ppb, 75 ppb,\nand 80 ppb, based on various standards that were considered\nfor maximum 1-hour ozone and maximum 8-hour ozone.\nNote that even though outcome at time t (Y(t)) and exposure\nat time t \u00c0 1 (A*(t)) actually are measured during the same\nquarter, we assume that A*(t) precedes Y(t), which is required\nfor any causal interpretation of the effect (17).\nThe primary analysis was based on 2 approaches:\n1) history-restricted marginal structural models (HRMSM)\n(21) and 2) history-restricted causal models for realistic in-\ndividualized exposure rules (HRCMIER) (22).\nWe did not assume that each spatial/geographic unit was\nsampled from 1 common distribution P but rather that each\nunit was sampled from n distinct distributions, Pi\n, that might\nhave been similar, particularly for those units that were\nspatially close. Under this assumption, it follows that mutual\nindependence between the random variables Oi\n, conditional\non the exposure regimen, is a reasonable approximation.\n(See the supplemental material in Moore et al. (17).)\nHistory-restricted causal models for realistic\nindividualized exposure rules\nThe HRMSM approach defines causal effects based on\nthe concept of counterfactual outcomes. These are the out-\ncomes that would have been observed if the grids, possibly\ncontrary to fact, had had a particular exposure history of\ninterest--for example, a hypothesized (counterfactual) de-\ncrease of X ppb below the observed quarterly average. An\nHRMSM can be used to study the counterfactual proportion\nof cardiac mortality in a given quarter t under the hypothet-\nical scenario in which all grids are exposed to a given ozone\nlevel a*(t \u00c0 1), where a*(t \u00c0 1) can be either ``high'' (i.e.,\nabove a standard) or ``low'' (i.e., below a standard).\nHRMSM is a model for the distribution of the counterfac-\ntual outcomes over a restricted period of time, denoted\nAmbient Ozone Concentrations and Cardiac Mortality 1235\n(t), as opposed to a standard marginal structural\nmodel, which is a model for the distribution of the counter-\nfactual outcomes over the entire time history, Y\n\u00f0t\u00de.\nThus, HRMSM are applied in studies in which only\npart of the exposure history, rather than the entire history,\nCausal inference relies on 2 primary identifiability assump-\ntions that guarantee that there is enough information con-\ntained in the observed data to infer the HRMSM parameter.\nThe first assumption is the sequential randomization assump-\ntion, which corresponds to the assumption of no unmeasured\nconfounding. To address this untestable assumption, we eval-\nuated a very large number of variables that have been con-\nsidered to be confounders in many such studies. The second\nassumption is the ETA assumption (also called the positivity\nassumption), which requires that each grid in the target pop-\nulation has a positive probability, regardless of its covariate\nhistory, of receiving all of the possible static interventions\n(i.e., the ozone concentration in each grid has a positive prob-\nability of being above or below the standard) at each point in\ntime. The estimators of HRMSM parameters can suffer from\nsevere bias in the presence of theoretical or practical ETA\nviolations (24). Practical violations of this assumption can\nbe tested by checking for very low estimated probabilities\nof high or low ozone concentrations based on the exposure\nmechanism model--that is, the conditional probability of ex-\nposure, given measured confounders. To mitigate the ETA\nviolation that almost certainly occurs with continuous expo-\nsure variables, we consider the discrete exposure variable in-\ndicating high ozone concentrations versus low concentrations\nbased on the standards noted previously. Despite discretiza-\ntion, violations of the ETA assumption commonly occur.\nAd hoc methods that have been proposed for addressing\nviolations of the ETA assumption do not address the prob-\nlem directly (25). One appropriate approach is to investigate\nthe population-level effect of realistic interventions that\ncould be introduced (22). ``Realistic'' individualized expo-\nsure rules are set such that static exposures are assigned only\nto those grids for which static exposure was possible (or\nrealistic), given their covariate history--that is, there is no\nETA violation for the dynamic treatment interventions de-\nfined by such rules. In regulatory settings, this may be par-\nticularly useful, since interest is in the population-level\neffect of intervention on a target population that is likely\nto experience the intervention. Inclusion of those subjects\n(grids) for whom (which) the intervention is not possible\nmay lead to biased estimation of the total population impact.\nConsider the binary exposure variable, denoted A*(t),\nwhich is equal to 1 if the ozone concentration falls above\na particular cutpoint (e.g., regulatory standard) and 0 if it is\nequal to or below that cutpoint. Now consider the rule that\nintervenes on A*\u00f0t\u00de: If the conditional probability that the\nozone concentration falls above the cutpoint, given covari-\nate(s), (P(A*(t) \u00bc 1j \nW(t \u00c0 1))), is less than a, then assign\nthe exposure to 0 (i.e., below the cutpoint); otherwise, assign\nit to 1. If the conditional probability that P(A*(t) \u00bc\nW(t \u00c0 1)) is less than a, then assign the exposure to 1;\notherwise, assign it to 0. Such a rule, d(a*(t \u00c0 1)(W)), is\na mapping of the covariate(s) W into a realistic treatment\n(Appendix, section A).\nHRCMIER are models for the marginal distribution of the\ncounterfactuals Yd\u00f0a*\u00f0t\u00c01\u00de\u00de\u00f0W\u00de that correspond to the realistic\nrule. Unlike HRMSM, which allow estimation of causal effects\nof static interventions (i.e., those interventions in which the\nentire population experiences the same level of exposure),\nthe parameters of HRCMIER are fully identifiable from the\ndata, even when the ETA assumption for static treatment in-\nterventions is violated. HRCMIER also generalize HRMSM;\nthat is, if there are no ETAviolations based onthe given a level,\nor similarly if a \u00bc 0, then the realistic intervention corresponds\nwith the static intervention (Appendix, section B).\nWe consider 2 HRCMIER:\nE(Yd\u00f0a*\u00f0t\u00c01\u00de\u00de\u00f0W\u00de\na*(t \u00c0 1):\nE(Yd\u00f0a*\u00f0t\u00c01\u00de\u00de\u00f0W\u00de\nj t) \u00bc m2(a*(t \u00c0 1); tjbt\n)\nModel 1 (equation 1) imposes a constant effect of ozone on\ncardiac mortality over the study period; model 2 (equation 2)\nallows for the effect of ozone to vary over the study period--\nthat is, in model 1, the effects of counterfactual contrasts are\nconstant over time; in model 2, a given counterfactual con-\ntrast has a different effect at different times. Note that time t is\nrepresented by quarter number, which refers to the quarters\nwerefittedwiththeinverseprobability-of-treatmentweighting\n(IPTW) procedure (26) (Appendix, section C). Selection be-\ntween these 2 HRCMIER was based on the minimum\ncross-validatedempiricalriskbasedonthe IPTW lossfunction\n(27). The HRMSM--that is, the models for E(Ya*\u00f0t\u00c01\u00de)--also\nwere fitted with the IPTW estimation procedure (Appendix,\nsection D). Although they are not directly comparable to the\nbinary exposure effect estimates, results from the traditional\nregression approach and the G-computation-based\nHRMSM--that is, models for E(Ya\u00f0t\u00c01\u00de), treating ozone as\na continuous variable (A(t))--are provided in Web Table 3.\nSince the consistency of the IPTW estimate relies on con-\nsistent estimation of the parameters of the model for the expo-\nsure mechanism, a data-adaptive model selection algorithm,\nnamely the deletion/substitution/addition algorithm, was ap-\nplied (28). This is a data-adaptive model selection procedure\nbased on cross-validation that searches through a large space\nof polynomial models and was applied by Moore et al. (17).\n(Data adaptive estimation techniques based on cross-\nvalidation are the most flexible approaches to model selection\nand have been demonstrated theoretically to be superior to\nother, less aggressive approaches (29).) The variables associ-\nated with both ozone and cardiac mortality (i.e., putative\nconfounders; Web Table 4) were candidates for the algorithm\nfor both sexes. We applied the bootstrap procedure (10,000\niterations) to obtain P values for the coefficients in the models.\nRESULTS\nSelected characteristics of the population for quarters 2 and\n3 are presented in Table 1 (see Web Table 5 for the complete\nlist). Ozone concentrations declined steadily throughout the\nstudy period (Web Figure 2). Median 1-hour and 8-hour daily\nmaximum ozone levels (which were highly correlated: r \u00bc\n0.99) for quarters 2 and 3 declined across all grids (Web Table\n1). Substantial declines were seen for the other pollutants as\nwell (supplemental material in Moore et al. (17)). Nonethe-\n13.2% of the quarterly, average 1-hour maximum ozone con-\ncentrations exceeded the levels of the California and federal\nhour maximum ozone concentrations showed moderate cor-\n(r \u00bc 0.52) and little correlation with the\nCardiac mortality decreased over time for both males and\nfemales (Web Figure 3). Across the study period, the median\nmortality proportions from acute cardiac events were 5.6 per\nWe estimated the exposure mechanism model with a lo-\ngistic regression model, selected by means of the deletion/\nsubstitution/addition algorithm and including the following\nvariables: current quarter's ozone concentrations for both\nsexes, previous quarter's 24-hour average carbon monoxide\nconcentration for females, grid-specific average 24-hour\ntemperature for quarter, time, grid-specific percentage of\nwhite persons in quarter, grid-specific median household\nincome in quarter, grid-specific percentage of foreign-born\npersons in quarter, grid-specific percentage of persons who\nhad graduated from high school in quarter, grid-specific\npercentage of persons born in a state other than California\nin quarter, and grid-specific percentage of Hispanic persons\nin quarter. Comparison of the HRMSMs based on the em-\npirical risk showed the model that included time (model 2)\nto have the better fit. Therefore, all subsequent results are\nbased on model 2.\nAs expected with continuous exposure variables, the plot\nof the predicted ozone levels versus the observed levels\nshowed that the relation was nearly linear, indicating an\nETAviolation (Web Figure 4). To investigate ETAviolations\nbased on the discrete high-ozone versus low-ozone variable,\nwe set the cutpoint for discretizing exposure to high levels\nof quarterly average maximum 1-hour concentrations--90\nobserved ozone levels above these cutpoints would be very\nunlikely to achieve quarterly ozone concentrations below\nthe respective cutpoints, based on the data. We identified\nthe specific grids that would have large numbers (over\n50% of the observed quarters) of ETA violations for various\nexposure rules (Web Figure 4). Almost all grids which had\nlow probabilities (a 0.1) of quarterly average 1-hour max-\nima above 80 ppb or below 70 ppb were on or near the coast\nor inland, respectively.\nThe HRMSM analysis, which investigates the effect of all\ngrids' moving from levels above the cutpoint to levels below\nthe cutpoint, estimates the effect based on extrapolation that\nmay not be warranted (bias), since it assumes that all grids\ncan experience such an intervention. We applied the\nHRCMIER to estimate the effect of 3 discrete ozone vari-\nhour average maximum quarterly ozone concentrations. The\nTable 1.

The HRCMIER results indi-\ncated that there was no consistent evidence that, if contrary\nto fact, reductions in ozone concentrations from levels\nabove any of these cutpoints to levels below these cutpoints\nwould lead to decreases in cardiac mortality (Table 3, bot-\ntom). The only significant term was the ``quarter'' term,\nwhich was negative and was consistent with the observed\ndecline in cardiac deaths over time. In comparison, the\nHRMSM results indicated that there was a significant effect\nof reductions in ozone concentrations (interaction variable\nand main term) below the cutpoints 75 ppb and 80 ppb for\nfemales and below 80 ppb only for males (data not shown).\nThere was no significant effect for ozone discretized at the\n70-ppb cutpoint for females and no effect for the 70- and 75-\nppb cutpoints for males (data not shown).\nSince the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard\nfor ozone is based on an 8-hour maximum, we carried out\na similar analysis with the 8-hour maximum used as the\nquarterly exposure. The 1-hour ozone standard was replaced\nwhat effect a change to the 8-hour standard might have had\non estimated ozone-associated cardiac mortality.\nOn the basis of the 8-hour maximum HRCMIER analysis\nquarterly ozone concentrations on cardiac mortality for both\nsexes (Table 4). For all years through quarter 2 of 1998, for\nall cutpoints and both sexes, the fit of the HRCMIER esti-\nmated a smaller mortality reduction than did the estimate\nbased on the HRMSM fit (for all cutpoints and quarters, see\nHRCMIER estimates indicated that none of the interven-\ntions to lower quarterly ozone below each cutpoint would\nresult in reductions in cardiac mortality for either sex. In\ncontrast, the HRMSM approach continued to show small\nreductions for females through 1999 for all cutpoints; for\nmales, the only estimated reduction was for the 80-ppb cut-\npoint (Table 5; for complete data, see Web Tables 6 and 7).\nAlthough the results are not directly comparable, since\nthe HRCMIER results are based on a discrete ozone vari-\nable, the results are different from those of the continuous\nozone HRMSM analysis, which showed a significant effect\nof ozone on cardiac-related mortality for both the quarterly\naverage 1-hour and 8-hour maximum concentrations (Web\nTable 3). We caution against interpreting the results based\non continuous ozone because of the severe violation of the\nETA assumption.\nDISCUSSION\nWe observed statistically significant, population-level\n``causal'' associations between 1- and 8-hour maximum\nhigh ozone concentrations versus low concentrations\n(i.e., above standard-based cutpoints vs. below those cut-\npoints) and cardiac mortality in the South Coast Air Basin\ndecreased over time. However, the results were model-\nand metric-dependent and were sensitive to violations of\nthe ETA assumption. In contrast to the HRMSM approach,\napplication of the HRCMIER that covered the period\nity related to decreasing the ozone concentrations from\nabove the cutpoints to below the cutpoints for either the\n1-hour maximum quarterly ozone concentrations or the 8-\nhour concentrations. When the HRCMIER was applied to\nduring which the 8-hour maximum ozone standard was in\neffect, a significant decrease in cardiac mortality was ob-\nserved, but only through 1997. It then declined to 0% for\nthe remaining 3 years (Web Table 6 and Web Table 8).\nThese latter estimates were based on the expected reduc-\ntions in mortality over all grids on the basis of intervening\nonly in those grids for which the intervention was possible.\nThese are more conservative estimates than were obtained\nwith the HRMSM or were obtained with a conventional\nregression model (analysis not shown), both of which as-\nsume that all grids could experience ozone concentrations\nabove and below the standard. In fact, approximately two-\nthirds of grids with observed quarterly 1-hour maximum\nozone concentrations greater than 90 ppb or 110 ppb had\nvery low predicted probabilities of experiencing ozone\nconcentrations below the cutpoints (Table 2)--that is, they\nviolated the ETA assumption consequent to meteorologic\nTable 2.

In earlier\nyears, there were also ETA violations due to the fact that\nfor some grids, the conditional probability of experiencing\nozone concentrations below the cutpoint was low. These\nviolations in earlier years affected the HRCMIER parameter\nestimates, because those grids with low probabilities of\nozone levels falling below the cutpoint had higher cardiac\nmortality, whereas those grids with low probabilities of\nozone levels going above the cutpoint did not. Thus, these\n2 approaches give similar inferences when there are few\nETA violations, but they differ in the face of the complex\nETA violations observed. However, the cost of nonviolation\nof the ETA assumption for both approaches is that we were\nnot able to analyze ozone as a continuous variable, which\nwould have been desirable in terms of estimation of popu-\nlation exposure-response relations.\nOur results are difficult to compare with those of meta-\nanalyses that form the core of recent evidence that increases\nin ozone concentrations, particularly during the summer\nmonths, are associated with increases in mortality (4, 5,\n11, 12). All of these studies used short-term lagged effects;\nTable 3.

Given our\ninterest in population-level (marginal) inferences, it turns\nout that conventional statistical methods proved inadequate.\nWe considered discrete exposure variables indicating high\nozone concentrations versus low concentrations because\nthere were clear violations of the assumption that the con-\nditional probability of experiencing all ozone levels was\npositive in all 195 spatial units over all 36 quarters of data\nincluded in this analysis.

HRCMIER addresses this\nproblem through the use of exposure rules that intervene\nonly on units that have a ``reasonable'' conditional proba-\nbility of actually having ozone concentrations above and\nbelow some level, defining a more ``realistic'' parameter.\nIn summary, our approach anticipated the National Re-\nsearch Council recommendation to evaluate longer averag-\ning times with respect to ozone-associated mortality (10).\nWe demonstrated the need for sensitivity analyses that\nuse different modeling approaches based on flexible\nmodel-fitting practices. We also showed that failure to con-\nsider violations of the ETA assumption can lead to biased\nestimates and incorrect inference.\n"
