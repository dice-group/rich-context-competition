The purpose of this study was to test with panel data an extended model of the stress process recognizing\nthe separate effects of a parent's need for care and an adult child's caring activities.\nnonlinear mixed models of mental health outcomes. We assessed mental health for separate samples of 3,350 men and\n3,659 women by using an 8-item scale of depressive symptoms. We also explored the sensitivity of results to alternative\nmeasures and model specifications.\nResults. We found that female, but not male, caregivers whose parents needed care exhibited adverse mental health\nconsequences. However, we found that, generally, both male and female noncaregivers whose parents needed care were\nmore likely to report symptoms of depression than were noncaregivers without disabled parents. Additional findings\nsuggest that the stress process is still more complex among married couples.\nDiscussion. This study distinguishes the outcomes of parental care needs from those attributable to caregiving\nactivities. Adverse psychological outcomes appear to be dispersed throughout the family. To focus narrowly on active\ncaregivers is to underestimate the social burdens of disability at older ages.\nASUBSTANTIAL body of research addresses the mental\nhealth consequences of providing informal care to\ndisabled elders. Theoretical contributions have identified\nvarious stressors, rewards, and family roles as aspects of the\ncaregiving process, and numerous empirical studies have\npresented evidence of the adverse effects of being a caregiver.\nAlthough recognizing that an older parent or spouse's\ndisability is itself an independent disturbance acting throughout\nthe family (Brody, Hoffman, Kleban, & Schoonover, 1989;\nSchulz, O'Brien, Bookwala, & Fleissner, 1995), most empir-\nical literature confines its attention to consequences among\nactive caregivers only. In some cases, studies have also\nexamined adaptations to the death of the care recipient.\nResearchers have directed much less attention beyond\ncaregiver\u00adcare recipient dyads.\nThe general stress and adaptation literature, which provides\na foundation for much caregiver stress research, views stress\nas a complex process with interrelated domains of sources,\nmediators, and manifestations (Pearlin, 1989; Pearlin, Lieber-\nman, Menaghan, & Mullan, 1981). Caregiving stressors are\ndefined as difficulties created by care demands that are\ndisruptive for a caregiver insofar as they exceed the individual's\nability to adapt (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, &\nWhitlatch, 1995). Researchers have differentiated between\nprimary stressors (e.g., the care recipient's impaired condition\nor the caregiver's subjective emotional reaction to it) and\nsecondary stressors (problems arising as a result of caregiving\nbut outside of caregiving roles; Aneshensel et al.). Although\nthis theory clearly identifies parental disability as one of the\nstressors associated with caregiving, researchers have not yet\nfully explored its effect on family members other than those\ninvolved in direct care provision.\nAlthough researchers have directed much attention towards\nstressors and their negative consequences, being a caregiver can\nproduce psychological benefits as well as costs. Caregivers\nreport multiple enjoyable aspects of care, such as enhanced\ncaregiver\u00adcare recipient relationships, personal growth, caring\nself-competence, increased understanding of the aging process,\nsatisfaction with social involvement, and ability to provide\ngood care (for a meta-analysis, see Pinquart & So\nRaschick and Ingersoll-Dayton (2004) found that adult\nchildren who provided care to their parents experienced more\nrewards than did spousal caregivers. A ``unified model'' linking\ncaregiver stress to health outcomes, discussed in Schulz,\nporated both adverse and positive responses to caregiving,\nsuggesting that physical and mental health outcomes repre-\nsented net responses to these opposing forces.\nAlthough past work has often focused on the individual\ncaregiver rather than the whole family (Gatz, Bengtson, &\nBlum, 1990), more recent studies have viewed caregiving as\na family-system problem. Caregiving affects all members of\na family network by diverting a caregiver's time away from\nother family members, changing the family's lifestyle and\nconditions, producing feelings of guilt, and engendering\nconflict over the care arrangements (Brody et al., 1989; Gatz\net al.; Strawbridge & Wallhagen, 1991; Toseland, Smith, &\nMcCallion, 1995). Although this theory has implications for\nnoncaregiving family members, this group has not been\na particular focus of caregiving research.\nIn Amirkhanyan and Wolf (2003), we found evidence of\nnoncaregiver stress, manifested as a decline in emotional health\nassociated with an older parent's need for care and distinct from\nan adult child's caregiving activities. Our analysis of cross-\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nsectional data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS), which collected data from caregivers and noncaregivers\nwith different patterns of parental care needs, allowed us to\nseparate the psychological outcomes of parental disability from\nthose impacts uniquely attributable to caregiving activities. Our\nfindings suggested that it may not have been caring itself, but\nrather one's parent's need for care, that produced the adverse\nmental health consequences of caregiving discussed in the\npast research.\nThe literature on caregiver stress continues to grow, but\ninvestigators continue to overlook the separate contributions to\nhealth outcomes made by a loved one's care needs and one's\nresponse to those needs. For example, Dunlop, Song, Lyons,\ncompared the prevalence of major depression between re-\nspondents who did and did not help their parents with basic\ndaily activities. Similarly, Chumbler, Pienta, and Dwyer (2004)\nused 1992 HRS data in order to compare the depression scores\nof adult children caring for, and not caring for, older parents.\nBoth studies found elevated levels of depression among\ncaregivers (although in the latter study, this finding emerged\nonly among respondents with a living father); neither study,\nhowever, included controls for parents' needs for care.\nOur 2003 study is subject to the usual problems associated\nwith use of cross-sectional data, particularly that of omitted-\nvariable bias. For example, intergenerational correlations in\nhealth might lead to a common dependence of parental care\nneeds and one's own poor mental health on omitted factors.\nFurthermore, various selection mechanisms might lead indi-\nviduals with a predisposition to the manifestations of stress to\nadopt, or to persist in, parent-care activities. Accordingly, the\ngoal of the present study is to provide a methodologically more\nrigorous validation of the model proposed and tested in our\nprevious work. Specifically, we address the missing-variable\nproblems by applying a random-effects estimator to panel data\nfrom later waves of the HRS. We also explore the sensitivity of\nour basic findings to several alternative measures and model\nspecifications.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Data Source\nOur data came from the HRS, an ongoing panel study that\nbegan in 1992 and that collects a broad range of demographic,\nhealth, and economic data. Respondents were originally from\nbirth cohorts were added later (for an overview of the HRS, see\nUniversity of Michigan [n.d.]). Our analysis used data from\nchose these waves based on changes that study organizers made\nto the data collection instruments throughout successive waves\nof interviewing. Specifically, the questions used to form the\ndepression scale changed from Wave 1 to Wave 2 and have\nsince remained fixed, while the questions on care provided to\nparents changed from Wave 1 to Wave 2, and again from Wave\n2 to Wave 3, thereafter remaining fixed. Wave 3 of the HRS\n(and, if married, their spouses), but starting in 1998 this sample\nwas supplemented with persons born before 1931 or between\nspouses as well as respondents currently living in a nursing\nhome (or whose spouse is living in a nursing home) from this\nanalysis. However, we did include the characteristics of age-\nineligible respondents as spousal variables. In addition, we\nexcluded respondents with no surviving parents (and, if\nmarried, parents-in-law). We note below additional inclusion\nconditions and their implications for sample size.\nDependent Variable\nOur measure of psychiatric morbidity was a variation on the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression (CES-D) scale,\nwhich was designed to measure depressive symptoms by em-\nphasizing their subjective and affective elements (McDowell &\nHRS adopted an 8-item battery of CES-D items, with each item\nlimited to two response categories (yes and no). Six of the 8\nCES-D items indicate the presence of depression, and 2 indicate\nits absence. The lead-in question for this version of the CES-D\nreads as follows: ``Now think about the past week and the\nfeelings you have experienced. Please tell me if each of the\nfollowing was true for you much of the time during the past\nweek. Much of the time during the past week, . . ..'' Table 1\ncontains the 8 items that are then presented to respondents\n(bolded words in the table correspond to the variable names\nused in our presentation of results in the next section). Table 1\nalso shows the percentages of men and women who gave\npositive responses (after recoding, as appropriate) to each item.\nThis 8-item scale has been used in several published studies of\nmental health based upon HRS data (Gallo, Bradley, Siegel, &\nand colleagues assessed its reliability and validity using 1992\nand 1994 HRS data and concluded that it has acceptable\nmeasurement properties. Although the existing caregiving\nliterature discusses many positive aspects of caregiving,\nmeasures of psychological benefits of caring are not available\nin the HRS. The measure of emotional health used in this study\nthus captures the net effect of all negative and positive impacts\nof caregiving.\nThe CES-D items were not administered to proxy respon-\nTable 1.

Bolded words correspond to the variable\nnames used in our presentation of results in Table 2.\nsample individuals are missing a depression score. We used\nlogistic regression in order to identify the salient characteristics\nof the missing-data cases; the results (not shown) indicated that\nindividuals with missing CES-D responses were principally\nolder husbands with poor self-reported health. None of the\nexplanatory variables associated with caregiver activities or\nwith needs for care were significantly related to the absence of\nthe CES-D items. We did not introduce any explicit controls\nfor this selectivity in the results reported here.\nIndependent Variables\nNeed. --We constructed variables that indicated whether at\nleast one of the respondent's parents or, for married persons,\nparents-in-law, ``need[ed] any help with basic personal needs like\ndressing, eating, or bathing,'' or, due to a health condition, could\nnot ``be left alone for an hour or more.'' This information, which\ncame from two separate HRS questions, captured a relatively\nsevere level of parental disability, reflecting either a limitation\nin the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) or\na significant cognitive limitation. Beginning in 1998, the HRS\nadded a third question, ``Has a doctor ever said that your [mother/\nfather/mother-in-law/father-in-law] has a memory-related dis-\nease?'' This permitted a broadened measure of the parental need\nfor care, especially care needs associated with cognitive decline\n(Ory, Hoffman, Yee, Tennstedt, & Schulz, 1999).\nCaregiver. --Starting with Wave 3, the HRS asked respon-\ndents if they (or their spouses) had spent a total of 100 or more\nhours since the previous interview (or in the past 2 years)\nhelping parents or parents-in-law with basic personal activities\nlike dressing, eating, and bathing. Investigators asked partic-\nipants who responded affirmatively to specify (for themselves\nand their spouses, separately) the number of hours spent\nhelping each parent or parent-in-law. We have coded as\ncaregivers people who had spent a total of at least 200 hours\n(rather than the 100 hours built into the question) providing\ncare during the 2-year reference period. We made this choice in\norder to produce comparability with our past work (Amirkhan-\nyan & Wolf, 2003), in which we had coded as caregivers\nindividuals who had provided at least 100 hours of care during\ninterview in order to filter out low-intensity (e.g., 1 or 2 hours\nper week) caring activities. Implicit in that design decision was\nan assumption that care hours were evenly distributed through-\nout the 12-month period, an assumption that may have been\nincorrect; we discuss this problem in more detail later. Never-\ntheless, by imposing the 200-hour minimum threshold in the\ncurrent analysis, we identify as caregivers those whose average\ncare intensity is comparable to that used in our earlier research.\nRespondents who could not or would not specify a precise\nnumber of hours--about half of all reported caregivers--were\nfurther prompted by investigators to indicate whether their care\namounted to more or less than 200 hours, and, if more than\n200 hours, whether it was more or less than 500 hours. Using\nthese bracket questions, we were able to classify nearly all care-\ngiversaseitherlow-intensity(i.e.,providingfewerthan500hours\nof care) or high-intensity caregivers (i.e., providing 500 hours\nor more of care). We also created separate indicators of the pro-\nvision of care to one's own parents and to one's parents-in-law.\nThe activities mentioned in the HRS question that we used to\ncode our need variable (i.e., dressing, bathing, and eating) were\nidentical to those mentioned in the question upon which we\nbased our caregiver variable. An additional HRS question asked\nwhether respondents helped parents ``. . . with other things such\nas household chores, errands, transportation, etc.'' The tasks\nmentioned in this question fall into the category of instrumental\nADLs (IADLs), and we used this item to code an IADL care-\ngiver variable. The HRS does not, however, include a question\naimed at detecting parents' needs for IADL assistance.\nEach member of a couple could be coded as a caregiver,\nallowing us to include a spouse caregiver variable in the\nanalysis, as well. This variable was 0 by definition for single\nrespondents. Similarly, we constructed sibling (or spouse's\nsibling) caregiver variables, which indicated whether any of the\nrespondent's (or spouse's) siblings had helped their respective\nparents with basic personal needs in the past 2 years. The HRS\nquestionnaire does not impose a minimum on the hours-of-help\nquestion as it pertains to siblings. As an additional measure of\n``care by others,'' we included variables indicating whether the\nrespondent's parent or parent-in-law was institutionalized at the\ntime of the interview.\nThe need variable described in the preceding section refers to\nparents alive at the time of the interview, whereas the caregiver\nvariables just described refer to individuals who had provided\ncare to currently living, or to recently deceased, parents or\nparents-in-law at any time during the 2-year period preceding\nthe interview. In order to avoid falsely coding as a caregiver\na respondent who had provided care to a surviving parent\njudged not to need it, we eliminated from the sample any\nrespondents who had experienced the death of a parent (or\nparent-in-law) during the 2-year reference period. However,\nthat restriction did not completely eliminate problems caused\nby changing levels of care intensity within the 2-year period.\nSome people coded as caregivers may have provided all of\ntheir care hours early in the 2-year period, and none recently,\nwhereas others who adopted the caregiver role shortly before\nthe interview may not yet have reached the 200-hour threshold.\nWe coded participants in the former group as caregivers (but\narguably should not have done so), whereas we did not code\nthose in the latter group as caregivers (but surely should have\ndone so). Despite these ambiguities, researchers have used the\nHRS parental-care variable in several published papers (e.g.,\nDunlop, Lyons, Manheim, Song, & Chang, 2004; Killian,\nHardy, 1999). The problems outlined here will tend to bias\ndownward any adverse effects of providing care, because recent\n(yet currently inactive) caregivers would presumably be less\ndepressed than current caregivers. We conducted an auxiliary\nanalysis intended to assess the adequacy of our caregiver\nvariable, and we report our findings from that analysis in the\nnext section.\nAdditional variables. --We created dummy variables reflect-\ning the respondent's current health (poor health) and disability\nstatus (disabled). We coded the poor health variable as 1 if\na respondent rated his or her health as fair or poor (rather than\nexcellent, very good, or good). The disabled variable indicated\nwhether the respondent, when answering a question about\nemployment status, stated that he or she was ``disabled and\nunable to work.'' We used analogous variables in order to\ndescribe the health and disability status for married respon-\ndents' spouses.\nIndicators of the respondent's marital status included in the\nanalysis were: divorced or separated, widowed, and never mar-\nried. Two dummy variables represented educational attainment:\nwhether the person had received a high school diploma or\npassed an equivalency test, and whether the respondent had\nearned a college degree or higher. Other covariates describing\nrespondents' demographic characteristics were age, number of\nchildren, and two dummies indicating respondents being\nAfrican American or Hispanic. Wealth was a household-level\nvariable that measured total net worth, including both housing\nand non-housing equity.\nEstimation\nThe measurement properties of our dependent variable, in\ncombination with the presence of repeated individual-level\noutcome measures, presented special modeling and estimation\nproblems. Some past research employing the short form of the\nCES-D as used by the HRS has retained the full range of scale\nvalues (integers ranging from 0 through 8) while adopting an\nestimation approach that treated this inherently discrete variable\nas though it were continuous (Gallo et al., 2000; Siegel et al.,\nextremely skewed, with a modal value of 0. Imposition of\na logarithmic transformation (of the original score, to which is\nadded a small constant) is inadequate for producing a symmetric\ndistribution (Siegel et al., 2004). Commonly used regression-\ntype models for count data (e.g., Poisson or negative-binomial\nmodels) are inappropriate because such models impose no\nupper bound on the value of the count variable, yet the short\nform of the CES-D has an upper bound of 8. Moreover, models\nfor count data implicitly assume that all counted items are\nidentically distributed. Yet, the marginal distributions of the\neight CES-D items reported in Table 1 strongly indicate the\ninappropriateness of such an assumption. For men, the percent-\nage of affirmative responses ranged from 6% to 26%, whereas\nfor women it ranged from 9% to 33%. Some researchers have\nrecoded the underlying 8-item score into a dichotomous indi-\ncator according to a severity threshold (Blustein, Chan, &\nBurns, Crischilles, & Wallace, 2003); this approach, however,\nentails the loss of a substantial amount of information.\nIn order to address these issues, we modeled the CES-D\nscore using a nonlinear mixed model. Our model contained\nboth item-level and time-period fixed effects, along with a four-\ncomponent random effect. In particular, we modeled individual\ni's response to CES-D item j at time t, Yijt\n, using a binary\nlogistic regression:\nlogit\u00f0Pr\u00bdYijt\n\u00feui\n\u00feeit\nIn Equation 1, the variables T2\nare dummy variables\ninterviews, respectively. Thus, the constants a1j\nrepresent item-specific intercepts in time period 1 (1996), while\nare time-period fixed effects that apply equally to all\noutcomes. Note that a single parameter vector (b) represents the\neffects of explanatory variables (Xit\n) on all eight CES-D items.\nWe model the random effects ui\nand eit\nindependent normally distributed effects with variances to be\nestimated. We interpret ui\nas a measure of fixed personality\ntraits that manifest themselves in a tendency to respond to all\neight CES-D items more (or less) positively than expected,\nconditional on the measured explanatory variables Xit\n, while\neach of the period-specific random effects eit\nare interpreted as\ntransitory influences on the CES-D items. For example, short-\nterm work- or family-related stressors salient during a respon-\nproduce a tendency to respond to all eight CES-D items more\n(or less) positively than would be expected given both the\ncontemporaneous measured variables Xi1\nand the permanent\nrandom effect ui\n. We estimated the model using aML software\nRESULTS\nWe first present results from a ``basic'' model--a repeated-\nmeasures counterpart to the approach taken in Amirkhanyan\nand Wolf (2003)--and then from three variations on that basic\nmodel. Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for the sample used\nin the basic model, along with estimated parameters of the\nmodel. The number of distinct men (women) appearing in the\nor three times depending on the vital status of his or her parents\nin each wave, the number of observations contributed by these\nor she is observed, a respondent supplies 8 outcome measures,\nso the overall sample sizes for the regressions are quite large.\nThe need and care variables in combination identified four\ndistinct groups: (a) noncaregivers whose parents do not need\ncare (the reference group); (b) caregivers whose parents are not\nreported to need care; (c) noncaregivers whose parents do need\ncare; and, finally, (d) caregivers whose parents need care. Our\nanalysis used a set of dummy variables that distinguished\namong the cells of this two-way categorization. Women were\nmore than twice as likely as men to care for parents, regardless\nof whether the parent receiving the care had been judged by the\nrespondent not to need it (1.2% vs 0.5%) or to need it (6.1% vs\n2.8%). Around 31% of both the men and the women in this\nsample had one or more living parents or parents-in-law that\nreportedly needed care, but for whom these men and women\nwere not themselves providing such care.\nThe regression results shown in Table 2 generally support the\nfindings from our previous study. For both men and women, it\nappeared to be stressful not to provide care when one's parent\nneeded it--we found, in other words, evidence of significant\nnoncaregiver stress. The odds of an affirmative response to\na CES-D item rose slightly more for women (odds ratio \u00bc 1.26)\nthan for men (odds ratio \u00bc 1.16) in this situation. Among\nwomen, but not men, there was also a significant increase in\nthe odds of reporting depressive symptoms if they were caring\nfor a parent with care needs. Although the point estimates\nimply that being a caregiver is more stressful than not being\na caregiver, conditional on a parent's need for care, we failed\nto find significant differences between the regression coeffi-\ncient on the ``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc yes'' variable and that on the\n``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc no'' variable. For women, for example, the\ntest statistic (formed using the covariance matrix of regression\ncoefficients) was t \u00bc 1.202 ( p \u00bc .23). Thus, whereas for women\n(but not men) we found evidence of caregiver stress, the\nobservable manifestations of that stress were not statistically\ndifferent from those of noncaregiver stress. We found no\nmental health effects of providing IADL assistance; or of the\ncare activities of spouses, siblings, or siblings-in-law; nor did\nwe find any effects of parental institutionalization.\nIn most cases, coefficients on covariates included in these\nequations (which are not shown here but are available upon\nrequest) accorded with past research: Depression scores fell\nwith age and education, rose in response to disability or poor\nhealth, and were higher among unmarried than married in-\ndividuals. The item-specific intercepts also exhibited consider-\nable variability, as we would have anticipated based upon\nthe means shown in Table 1 (likelihood-ratio tests overwhelm-\ningly rejected an equality constraint on the intercepts, with v2\nmodels, respectively). The results also indicated that a good\ndeal of the pattern of CES-D responses was associated with\nunmeasured factors, represented by the random effects ui\nand\n. Each of these random effects was estimated with a\nhigh degree of precision. Moreover, in any given year slightly\nmore than half of the variability in unmeasured factors was due\nto permanent factors.\nAs noted earlier, our indicator of caregiver status missed\nsome current caregivers, those who had moved into the care-\ngiver role shortly before the interview and had not yet reached\nthe 200-hour threshold embedded into our caregiver variable. It\nalso included as caregivers some persons who had occupied\nthat role within the past 2 years, but not at or immediately prior\nto the time of interview. For both of these reasons, any\nestimated impacts of caring on CES-D scores (through either\nthe ``need \u00bc no, care \u00bc yes'' or the ``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc yes''\npathways) may be biased downward. As a test of the adequacy\nof our caregiver variable, we estimated a conventional model\nof caregiver stress: In this model, we controlled for caregiver\nstatus but not for parental need, producing a regression-adjusted\ndifference in depressive responses between caregivers and\nnoncaregivers (all other control variables appeared in these\nmodels). In this version of the model, the estimated increase in\nthe log odds of a positive response was 0.189 for men (SE \u00bc\n0.237 in a model that pooled men and women, with an\nFor an external point of comparison to these estimated effects,\nwe used results obtained in the meta-analysis reported by\nPinquart and So\nseparately published articles, Pinquart and So\n\u00a8rensen found a\nmean effect size of 0.29 standard deviations on depression\nscores among adult child caregivers; the lower and upper bounds\nof the 95% confidence interval for this estimate were 0.10 and\norder to convert our estimates to effect sizes; Chinn's method\n(which entails dividing the log-odds coefficient by a scale factor\nfor men and women combined. Both estimates lie within the\ninterval estimate for caregiver effects reported by Pinquart and\nSo\n\u00a8rensen (2003). The latter comparison was undoubtedly more\nvalid, because Pinquart and So\n\u00a8rensen did not stratify their results\nby caregiver gender. Although this comparison did not prove\nthat the HRS caregiver variable was free of measurement error, it\ndid lend support to its use as an indicator of caregiving status in\nan impact analysis such as ours.\nThe remaining tables report results from three variations on\nour basic model; in each case we report only the key parameters\nrepresenting the need and care effects. Table 3 shows the\nconsequences of distinguishing between low-intensity (from\ncaregiving. These findings used slightly smaller samples,\nbecause we omitted from the analysis caregivers for whom\nwe could not assign intensity categories. The mean values\nshown indicate that women were more likely to be in the high-\nintensity category (77% of all female caregivers) than were men\n(71% of all male caregivers). The care-intensity distinction did\nnot alter the findings shown in Table 2: We found statistically\nsignificant noncaregiver stress for both men and women, but\nTable 2.

And,\nalthough the point estimates on low- and high-intensity care-\ngiving were larger than the coefficient on ``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc\nno'' for women, those two coefficients were not significantly\ndifferent from each other nor were they significantly different\nfrom the ``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc no'' coefficient.\nTable 4 shows the consequences of using the broader\nHRS data. The broader need variable added very few cases of\notherwise undetected parental need for care, however (and did\nso mainly in the ``need\u00bcyes, care\u00bcno'' category). For women,\nthe findings agreed with those already reported. However, for\nmen, we no longer found evidence of noncaregiver stress.\nFinally, Table 5 shows the results after having employed\nseparate need and care variables for the respondent's parents\nand parents-in-law. Because these models were intended to get\nat possible own-parent versus parent-in-law effects, we limited\nthe analysis to married men and women (the number of men\nand women differed, however, due to the fact that spouses with\nout-of-range years of birth were excluded from the study).\nExcept for the ``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc no'' variables, the means\nwere quite small. Unsurprisingly, women who provided care to\ntheir own parents represented the most common caregiving\nsituation. However, it is interesting to note that married men\nwere almost as likely to care for their parents-in-law as for their\nown parents, and married women were about as likely as their\nhusbands to care for their husbands' parents. Only 2 of the\n12 regression coefficients shown in Table 5 were statistically\ndifferent from zero at the p \u00bc .05 level: It appeared that\nhusbands' mental health was adversely affected by having\nparents-in-law with care needs yet not being involved in caring\nfor them. Among married women, we found statistically sig-\nnificant evidence of caregiver stress but not of noncaregiver\nstress with respect to their own parents' needs.\nDISCUSSION\nThe adverse mental health consequences of providing care to\na disabled or frail elderly family member are well established\nin the literature. Our goal in the present study was to investigate\nan additional possibility, namely the consequences of not\nproviding care when a close family member needs it. Our\nfindings generally suggest that having a parent with serious care\nneeds produces adverse mental health consequences, especially\nfor women. The exception to this pattern occurred in the model\nthat used separate controls for parents' and parents-in-law's\nneed and care, applied to married men and women only (Table\n5). In that case, we found evidence of noncaregiver stress\nfor men (but only with respect to their wives' parents) and of\ncaregiver stress for women (but only with respect to their own\nparents). Such findings suggest that it may be worthwhile to\nfurther explore the subtle differences in the effects of various\ncaregiving arrangements involving own parents and in-laws.\nSpecifically, it may be interesting to examine whether men are\nnegatively affected by in-laws' care needs when their wives\nare involved in caregiving. This could be done by adding\ninteraction effects (for example, Own care for own parents 3\nSpousal care for in-laws; Own care for in-laws 3 Spousal care\nfor own parents; and others) to our third model. The sample size\navailable for the present study does not allow us to address this\nlevel of complexity. Moreover, our objectives in the present\nstudy were more limited in scope, namely to demonstrate using\npanel data that being a noncaregiver and having a disabled\nparent or parent-in-law can produce adverse mental health out-\ncomes similar to those of caregivers.\nOur results were generally consistent with those found in\nour earlier cross-sectional analysis (Amirkhanyan & Wolf,\n2003). Both studies call into question the interpretations of\nmuch prior empirical research on caregiver stress. In the typical\nstudy, a researcher compares the mean depression score in a\nsample of caregivers to that in a matched comparison group\nof noncaregivers. In the comparison group, the potential care\nrecipients are presumably in good health and are not disabled.\nWith such a research design, interpretation of between-sample\ndifferences is problematic: The difference could arise because\ncaregiving is stressful, or it could arise because having a close\nfamily member with care needs is stressful. Our use of a sample\nof persons at risk of being caregivers, while controlling for\nthe various need and caring situations, supports the latter in-\nterpretation.\nAs noted earlier, the HRS data introduce some unavoidable\nmeasurement problems into our analysis. Principal among these\nis a timing problem, due to the fact that the need and outcome\nvariables were contemporaneous with the interview, whereas\nthe care variable pertained to a 2-year reference period. The\nmost important of our findings, namely the pervasiveness of\nnoncaregiver stress, is probably the least affected by this\nproblem. Someone who has provided fewer than 200 hours of\ncare over a 2-year period is surely not a caregiver, unless they\ntook on the caregiver role just before the interview. This type\nTable 4.

For individuals coded\nas caregivers, the measurement error problems were probably\nmore serious, at least in a relative sense in view of the fact that\nmany more observations appeared in the ``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc\nno'' than in the ``need \u00bc yes, care \u00bc yes'' category. Here, again,\nmeasurement error will tend to produce a downward bias in\nestimated effects. Accordingly, our findings that caregiver\nstress is not larger than noncaregiver stress (with the one\nexception mentioned earlier) should be treated cautiously. And,\ndespite the potential--and untestable--measurement-error\nproblems, our estimate of the relative size of caregiver and\nnoncaregiver depression scores fell within the range of impacts\nreported in a recent and comprehensive meta-analysis (Pinquart\n& So\nAlthough the caregiver stress literature has shown that\nwomen experience more caregiving costs than do men\nour results suggest that women may also experience higher\ncosts of being noncaregivers. This result raises questions about\nthe consequences of gender-specific role expectations among\nwomen. Relationships between adult children and their parents\nare often shaped by two apparently conflicting sets of norms:\nobligation and independence (Lye, 1996). Research has shown\nthat gendered expectations of such obligations treat as equitable\ncaregiving arrangements with overinvolved women and under-\ninvolved men (Ingersoll-Dayton, Neal, Ha, & Hammer, 2003).\nConsequently, women whose behaviors are at odds with\na prevailing ideology that views them as natural caregivers\n(Hooyman & Gonyea, 1995) may suffer when they fail to take\non caregiving duties.\nThe existing literature on the stress process provides a basis\nfor interpreting our findings concerning noncaregiver stress.\nPast research has shown that caregivers report rewards as well\nas stressors associated with providing personal care. Thus, the\nnegative effect of the primary stressor, parental need, among\nnoncaregivers is not mediated by any rewards associated with\nthe provision of care. In addition, among noncaregivers the\nparent's needs for help dressing, eating or bathing are likely to\nbe met by other formal or informal sources. Researchers have\nfound that if siblings provide care, such situations can lead to\nfamily conflicts over caregiving arrangements; the primary\ncaregiver's strain may, as well, be radiated to other family\nToseland et al., 1995). If non-familial sources provide the care,\nnoncaregiver stressors may include the fear of inadequate\nquality of care or the feeling of guilt for not being able to ensure\na family-based end-of-life environment for a parent.\nFinally, our findings point to the diffusion of negative\nconsequences of parental disability, manifested throughout the\nfamily network, and touching not only the children but also the\nchildren-in-law of the elders affected. There is a growing\ninterest in the costs of disease and disability at the national\nand international level (e.g., Murray et al., 2002). For one\ncomponent of that cost--the adverse mental health consequen-\nces of caring for a disabled parent--the usual focus on the\nactive caregiver appears to be too narrow. In fact, we have\nfound only limited evidence that active caregivers are worse off\nthan other members of their families. The costs, in other words,\nare experienced throughout the family group. To focus\nnarrowly on active caregivers is to underestimate the social\nburdens of disability and poor health at older ages. Moreover,\ninterventions that reduce stress among active caregivers may, as\nwell, produce social benefits among family members not\nactively engaged in providing care. Thus, investigators may\nunderestimate both the social costs of old-age disability and the\nsocial benefits of programs that improve functioning when\nresearch is too narrowly focused. These results should be\nrecognized in efforts to design interventions on behalf of\ncaregivers and to evaluate the effectiveness and societal\nbenefits of such interventions.\n"
