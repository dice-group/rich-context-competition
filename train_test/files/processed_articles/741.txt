    "abstract": "Abstract: Data from the Current Population Survey are used in this DataWatch to explore the\nchanging composition of health insurance coverage of the U.S. nonelderly population. The authors\nanalyze coverage trends across various subpopulations for 1988-1993. During this time significant\ndeclines in employer-sponsored coverage coincided with equally significant increases in Medicaid\ncoverage. Thus, the increase in the proportion of nonelderly persons without health insurance appears\nrelatively small. However, this analysis reveals that the relative stability of the uninsurance rate for\nthe entire nonelderly population belies more significant changes in insurance coverage--and lack of\ncoverage--among various groups. The authors also discuss the extent to which a growing level of\npublic insurance \"crowds out\" (or substitutes for) private health insurance.\nConcerns about gaps in health insurance coverage played a prominent\nAmericans without health care coverage was too high, reform pro-\nponents argued, and the number was growing.

In fact, many of the groups that have the most extensive em-\nployer coverage saw their coverage erode, while groups that usually have\nthe highest rates of uninsurance made gains over the period.\nThe decline in employer-sponsored coverage is probably attributable to a\nnumber of factors.

Second, rather than dropping\ncoverage, some employers are shifting more of the costs of health insurance\nonto employees by requiring them to pay a higher percentage of the pre-\nmium.3 This shift, coupled with declines in average real family incomes,\nmakes workers less likely to accept their employers' offer of insurance.\nMedicaid coverage has increased for several reasons. First, Medicaid\nenrollment has increased to some extent because of the decline in family\ndeclines in real incomes. Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC) rolls clearly have been expanding for reasons other than the\nrecession. Also, the number of Americans enrolled in the Supplementary\nSecurity Income (SSI) program has continued to increase. The number of\ndisabled persons receiving Medicaid grew 6 percent per year between 1988\nexpansions in Medicaid to cover children and pregnant women, beginning\nin 1984 and culminating with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act\nStudy data.

The percentage without insurance\nincreased from 6.5 percent to 9.4 percent. Among adults between ages\neighteen and thirty-four in this income range, the percentage with\nemployer-sponsored health insurance fell. The percentage who purchased\nnongroup coverage increased, but not enough to offset the drop in employer\ncoverage. As a result, the percentage without insurance increased from 13.7\npercent to 16.2 percent. Similarly, among higher-income adults ages thirty-\nfive to sixty-four, the percentage with employer-sponsored coverage fell by\n4.0 percentage points. Medicaid coverage increased slightly, and the result\nwas a 2.7-percentage-point increase in persons without health insurance.\nExhibit 4 examines the same data by work status. Among full-time\nworkers, employer-sponsored coverage fell. There were small increases in\nMedicaid and private nongroup coverage, but not enough to offset the\ndecline in employer-sponsored coverage. Thus, the percentage without\nhealth insurance increased from 13.2 percent to 15.4 percent. Similarly,\namong part-time workers, the increase in Medicaid coverage was not suffi-\ncient to offset the drop in employer-sponsored coverage, and the percentage\nof uninsured part-time workers increased from 19.3 percent to 21.7 percent.\nThe same pattern emerges for the self-employed.\nNonworkers fared somewhat better. Among dependents, the percentage\nwith employer-sponsored coverage fell from 73.2 percent to 66.2 percent, a\ndrop greater than that observed for full-time workers. But the percentage\nobtaining Medicaid coverage increased from 7.6 percent to 13.3 percent.\nMany of the workers who dropped dependent coverage may have been\nlow-wage workers who would be eligible for Medicaid. Among dependents,\nthe percentage without insurance increased less than it did for workers.\nPersons in families with no workers often have employer-sponsored cover-\nage, through retiree benefits, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcili-\nation Act (COBRA) provisions, or coverage by a family member outside\nThere were also declines in nongroup and \"other\" coverage (such as Civil-\nian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services [CHAMPUS])\namong this group.

David Cutler and Jonathan Gruber argue that new\nMedicaid expansions have largely served to \"crowd out\" the private cover-\nage families had before they were eligible for Medicaid.9 It is tempting to use\nthe data from our analysis to test the theory that new Medicaid coverage is\ncrowding out private coverage. For example, one could try to support this\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Those data show that the groups with the greatest\nMedicaid gains also had the greatest declines in employer-sponsored cover-\nage. (Some results support the counterargument, however. Looking at\ntrends by region in Exhibit 6, while the Northeast and Midwest had the\nsmallest gains in Medicaid coverage, they had the greatest losses of\nemployer-sponsored coverage.) These patterns are only suggestive, how-\never. They do not in any way indicate a causal link between Medicaid gains\nand declines in employer-sponsored coverage.\nDeclines in employer-sponsored coverage are occurring across all groups,\neven those with no substantial access to Medicaid coverage. For example,\nExhibit 1 shows a 3.5-percentage-point drop in employer-sponsored cover-\nage among the highest-income families, with only trivial access to Medic-\naid. Also, there clearly is a net gain in coverage as Medicaid coverage\nincreases for several groups. Medicaid coverage among the poor increased\n7.6 percentage points, while employer-sponsored coverage fell only 1.6\npoints. While some of the families losing employer-sponsored coverage may\nhave enrolled in Medicaid, clearly many persons gaining Medicaid coverage\nprobably did not have employer-sponsored coverage before.10\nThe groups that have gained Medicaid coverage have lower incomes.\nDeclining employer-sponsored coverage among low-income workers could\nbe the result of a substitution effect (as families drop private coverage\nbecause Medicaid is made available) or an income effect (as increases in\ndirect payment requirements for premiums and slowing wage growth force\nfamilies to drop coverage regardless of Medicaid). In recent years workers\nhave been required to pay a greater proportion of higher premiums. In 1987,\n43 percent of workers with single coverage and 36 percent with family\ncoverage had employers that paid their full premiums; in 1993 these propor-\ntions dropped to 34 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Given the greater\ndirect burden on families, one would expect employer-sponsored coverage\nto drop most rapidly among low-income groups regardless of changes in\nMedicaid access. In the absence of Medicaid eligibility, these persons might\nhave become uninsured.11\nThe evidence presented here clearly shows a net gain in coverage for\nsome groups and shows that many of the groups that experienced declines\nin employer-sponsored coverage did not benefit from offsetting growth in\nMedicaid. These patterns suggest that the importance of crowding out is\nlimited. But the data on this issue are not conclusive. We believe that the\nCPS cannot be used to estimate the extent to which expanded Medicaid\neligibility has displaced private coverage. A study using longitudinal house-\nhold data would allow for tracking of families' health coverage over time\nand may help to improve our understanding of changes in family coverage.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This finding as well as others from our study\nare significant for several reasons. The analysis demonstrates the limitations\nof continued reliance on private, employer-sponsored health care coverage.\nEmployer-sponsored coverage is sensitive to the business cycle, declining\nfamily incomes, and the rising costs of health care. The analysis also\ndemonstrates the success of Medicaid in covering targeted groups. Were it\nnot for Medicaid, the share of Americans without health insurance cover-\nage would have increased greatly during the period analyzed. If this had\noccurred, it might have effected the recent debate over health care reform\nin at least two ways. First, it might have increased the urgency with which\nCongress felt it must deal with the problem of the uninsured. Second, it\nmight have made policymakers less interested in building on the current\nemployer-based health insurance system.\nHowever, the successes of growing public coverage should be viewed in\nperspective; these gains have come at a high cost to states and the federal\ngovernment. Spending on Medicaid has been the fastest-growing compo-\nnent of most state budgets, crowding out spending on education and other\npriorities in many states and leading to tax increases in others.12 Proposals\nto shift responsibility for Medicaid coverage or to fund state programs\nthrough block grants could halt the growth in public coverage and possibly\nerode some of the recent growth in coverage we have observed. If this\noccurs and if employer-sponsored coverage continues to decline, the num-\nber of uninsured Americans could increase sharply in the next few years.\nSupport for this research was provided by grants from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\n(RWJF) (Grant no. 19324) and from The Henry J.

The Census Bureau changed its method for weighting the CPS sample with the 1994\nCPS. With the 1994 survey, the benchmark was shifted from the 1980 census to the\n1990 census. This may introduce apparent changes not associated with actual trends\nin the population. Analysis of the March 1993 CPS, for which weights are available\nusing both the 1980 and 1990 census benchmarks, suggests that the new weights do\nnot have a major impact on health insurance coverage across the population. In\naddition, changes in health insurance coverage on the 1994 file (new weights) relative\nto the 1993 file (with old weights) are consistent with changes from prior years, for\nwhich there had been no change in weights. For these reasons, we do not believe that\nthe change in weighting methods is problematic for this analysis.\n6. For a detailed discussion of this procedure, see L. Giannarelli, An Analyst's Guide to\n7. COBRA allows persons to purchase employer group coverage from a former employer.\nMembers of families with no current worker may gain employer-sponsored coverage\nthrough this provision.\n8. It is worth noting that the subgroups considered in Exhibit 5 are not subject to\n\"intergroup migration\" as are groups in other exhibits. That is, a person's race and sex\nare fixed, while other characteristics analyzed--income, age, residence, and so on--may\nhave changed between 1988 and 1993. Therefore, interpretation of these exhibits is\nnot complicated by trends that move people across groups.\n9. D.M. Cutler and J. Gruber, \"Does Public Insurance Crowd Out Private Insurance?\"\nNational Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper (Cambridge, Mass.: NBER,\n10. Even here this result is only suggestive. When we control for income group, we are not\nlooking at the same families in each year because the CPS is not a longitudinal survey.\nIn addition, families move in and out of income groups across these years, so poor\n11. In their analysis, Cutler and Gruber argue that the decline in the proportion of\nemployers paying full premiums is related to expansions of Medicaid eligibility. They\nargue that employers have increased workers' premium shares to encourage low-income\nworkers eligible for Medicaid to drop their employer plans. We believe that the\nevidence offered is inconclusive, however. Cutler and Gruber's analysis shows a\nnegative correlation between workers' eligibility for Medicaid and employers' choice\nto cover full health insurance premiums. Workers' eligibility for Medicaid also is\nassociated with low worker payrolls, so the correlation found between Medicaid\neligibility and partial payment of premiums may be an artifact of the relationship\nbetween low average pay and partial payment of premiums. It is well established that\nthe cost of health care benefits has increased significantly in recent years. Low-payroll\nfirms are generally not as capable of absorbing increased benefit costs as firms with\nhigher payrolls are; for example, higher benefit costs cannot easily be passed to other\ncomponents ofcompensation because of minimum-wage restrictions. Thus, low-payroll\nfirms are more likely than higher-payroll firms to pass increased costs directly to workers.\nIn addition, Cutler and Gruber's analysis is dependent on the assumption that workers\nobserved on the CPS are representative of all workers at their firm, which is frequently\nnot the case.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
