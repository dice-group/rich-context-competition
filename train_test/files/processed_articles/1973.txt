In adults, it has been well documented that older adults\nconsume more dietary supplements than do younger adults (1, 3,\n4). Dietary supplement users also tend to be women (3, 5), less\nlikely to smoke (6, 7), leaner (3, 5), and more physically active (3,\n7) than are nonusers. Furthermore, dietary supplement users have\nhigher levels of educational attainment and socioeconomic status\nthan do nonusers (5, 8). Dietary habits of supplement users may\nalso differ from those of nonusers; eg, supplement users have\nhigher intakes of fruit and vegetables (3, 6) and drink more wine\n(5) than do nonusers.\nSome (3, 9) but not all (10) reports suggested that adult users\nhave higher intakes of nutrients from their diets than do nonusers.\nThe prevalence of inadequate total micronutrient intakes (diet\nplus supplements) is lower in adults who use supplements than in\nadults who do not use supplements (9, 11, 12). However, total\nmicronutrient intakes of users of supplements may be in excess of\nUL5 recommendations for certain nutrients because of the large\namounts of nutrients contributed by dietary supplements (5).\nVery little is known about differences in mineral intakes of users\nand nonusers of supplements in nationally representative survey\ndata (13). It is important for the development of public health\npolicy to understand whether individuals who take dietary\nsupplements have a need for them (eg, to avoid nutrient defi-\nciencies) and whether dietary supplements can be used to meet\nnutrient requirements safely or if they contribute to risk of ex-\ncess intakes and toxicity. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis\nwas to examine mineral intakes from the diet and to determine\nhow supplements contribute to meeting or exceeding the DRIs\n1 From the Office of Dietary Supplements, NIH, Bethesda, MD (RLB);\nNutrition Impact LLC, Battle Creek, MI (VLF); Food & Nutrition Database\nResearch Inc, Okemos, MI (DRK); and the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutri-\ntion Research Center on Aging, the School of Medicine, and the Friedman\nSchool of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, MA (JTD).\n2 The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the views of the Office of Dietary Supplements\nor any other entity of the US Government.

Written informed consent was obtained for\nall participants or proxies, and the survey protocol was approved\nby the Research Ethics Review Board at the National Center for\npregnant and/or lactating women (n = 1241) were excluded,\nwhich left a final analytic sample of 8860 individuals.\nDietary intakes\nDiet\nNHANES participants were asked to complete an in-person\nhousehold interview and a health examination in a mobile ex-\namination center that included an in-person 24-h dietary recall. A\nsecond 24-h dietary recall was collected via telephone ;3\u00ad10 d\nafter the mobile examination center exam. Both 24-h dietary\nrecalls used the USDA's Automated Multiple-Pass Method (15,\nDietary supplements\nInformation on dietary supplement use over the past 30 d was\nobtained as part of the dietary supplement questionnaire (17).\nInformation included the participant's use of vitamins, minerals,\nherbs, and other dietary supplements. Detailed information, in-\ncluding the type, consumption frequency, duration of use, and\namount taken, for each reported dietary supplement was ob-\ntained. The average daily intake of nutrients from dietary sup-\nplements was calculated for individuals by using the number of\ndays supplement use was reported, the reported amount taken per\nday, and the serving size unit from the product label. Calcium\nfrom antacids was collected as part of the NHANES non-\nprescription drug questionnaire that participants self-completed\nat the home interview and was included in supplemental intake\ncalculations.\nOperational definitions\nNonusers of dietary supplements were defined as subjects who\ndid not report the consumption of a dietary supplement within the\npast 30 d; thus, dietary intakes for nonusers were based on intakes\nfrom foods alone. Users of dietary supplements were defined as\nsubjects who reported the consumption of a dietary supplement\nthat contained a given mineral within the past 30 d. For example,\na calcium user was someone who reported the use of calcium\nregardless of the source; therefore, the calcium could be from\na multivitamin or mineral supplement, a calcium supplement (ie,\nsingle nutrient supplement), or an antacid that contained calcium.\nDietary intakes (ie, from foods only) of users were compared with\nthose of nonusers. Total mineral intakes were defined for dietary\nsupplement users as mineral intakes from food sources plus\nmineral intakes from dietary supplements.\nThe prevalence of inadequate dietary intakes of a group was\ndetermined by using the EAR cutoff method for all minerals\nexcept iron (18). The probability method and the cutoff method\nare both approaches that require more than one 24-h dietary recall\nto adjust for individual variation. The EAR cutoff method\nassumes that there is no correlation between intakes and re-\nquirements, the variance in intakes is greater than the variance of\nrequirements, and the distribution of requirements is symmetrical\naround the EAR. If these assumptions are met, as was the case for\nall nutrients examined in this study except iron, the number of\nindividuals with usual intakes below the EAR is proportionate to\nthe prevalence of the group with inadequate intakes. Because the\ndistribution of requirements for iron was skewed (ie, not sym-\nmetrical), the cutoff method was not appropriate, and the\nprobability method was applied (18). All analyses were kept at\nthe group level, and interpretation of results were restricted to\ngroup-level differences.\nStatistical analysis\nThe NCI method (19) was used to determine estimates of the\nusual nutrient intake from the diet for nonusers and users of\ndietary supplements. The usual total nutrient intake (from the diet\nand supplements combined) was also estimated for users of\nsupplements with the NCI method. Covariates used in the NCI\nmodel were as follows: 1) the sequence of the 24-h recall, 2) the\nday of the week the 24-h recall was collected [dichotomized as\nweekend (Friday\u00adSunday) or weekday (Monday\u00adThursday)],\nand 3) dietary supplement use. Complete details of the NCI\nmethod are shown elsewhere (19), and the SAS macros (SAS,\nversion 9; SAS Institute Inc) necessary to fit this model and to\nperform the estimation of usual intake distributions are available\non the NCI website (20).\nDRI age groups were used to compare estimates of mineral\nintakes to EARs for minerals with established EARs. Potassium\ndoes not have an established EAR, and thus, only mean estimates\nwere presented. Because the distribution of requirements was\nskewed for iron, the probability method was used to determine the\nprevalence of the population below the EAR (21). The percentage\nof the population that exceeded the UL was also determined for\neach of the minerals with an established UL (21\u00ad23).\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SAS software\n(version 9; SAS Institute Inc). Sample weights were used to\naccount for differential nonresponse and noncoverage and to\nadjust for the planned oversampling of some groups. Survey\nweights were also used to generate nationally representative\nestimates for the US population. We compared mean dietary\nintakes of minerals between users and nonusers of dietary sup-\nplements and the proportion that met the EAR and exceeded the\nUL by computing a z statistic, which yielded the same result as\nan unadjusted regression model (24). Significance was set at\na Bonferroni-corrected P , 0.003 to ensure that the significance\nwe showed was not due to chance.\nRESULTS\nMean intakes by dietary supplement usage category\nFor men, dietary intakes from food sources of 4 minerals\n(magnesium, copper, potassium, and selenium) were higher in\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nusers than in nonusers of dietary supplements (Table 1). For\nminerals that did not differ by supplement use (calcium, iron,\nzinc, and phosphorus), total intakes (food plus supplements)\nwere significantly higher in supplement users than in nonusers.\nMineral-containing supplement use did not significantly in-\ncrease mean phosphorus, potassium, and selenium intakes from\nintakes from diet alone. In women, dietary intakes of supple-\nment users were significantly higher than those of nonusers for all\nof minerals examined with the exception of selenium. Phosphorus\nand potassium supplement use by women did not significantly\nincrease total intakes over intakes from food alone.\nDietary calcium intakes were significantly higher in supple-\nment users than in nonusers across all age groups for women but\nnot for men (see supplemental Table 1 under \"Supplemental\ndata\" in the online issue for a presentation of mean dietary in-\ntakes by the DRI age and sex groupings of supplement users and\nnonusers). Magnesium intakes from the diet were significantly\nhigher in male dietary supplement users than in nonusers at all\nages but not in women.\nPrevalence of inadequate intakes from food sources\nIn men, when food sources were considered alone, supplement\nusers and nonusers differed only in the prevalence of inadequacy\nfor magnesium and copper (Table 2). No differences between\nsupplement users and nonusers were observed in the prevalence\nof inadequate intakes from food sources alone for calcium, iron,\nzinc, phosphorus, or selenium. The prevalence of inadequate\niron, phosphorus, and selenium intakes from food sources was\nvery low in men (ie, ,0.5%). For all minerals except selenium,\nwomen who used dietary supplements had a significantly lower\nprevalence of inadequate mineral intakes from food sources than\ndid nonusers (see supplemental Table 2 under \"Supplemental\ndata\" in the online issue for a presentation of age-group dif-\nferences in the prevalence of inadequate mineral intakes be-\ntween supplement users and nonusers).\nPrevalence of inadequate total intakes (diet and\nsupplements combined)\nWe examined mineral intakes from food sources alone in\nsupplement nonusers and compared these diet-only intakes to\ntotal intakes (diet and supplements) of supplement users. As\nexpected, dietary supplement use lowered the prevalence of\ninadequate total intakes for every mineral examined in adults\nwhen sexes were combined (Figure 1). In men, dietary sup-\nplement users had a significantly lower prevalence of inadequate\ntotal mineral intakes for calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phos-\nphorus, and copper but not for selenium (Table 2). The use of\ndietary supplements lowered the prevalence of inadequate total\nintakes for each mineral examined in women; the most notable\ndifference between supplement nonusers and users was for\ncalcium intakes. Supplement use dramatically decreased the\nprevalence of inadequate calcium intake across all age groups of\nwomen (Figure 2).\nPrevalence of intakes above the UL\nMineral intakes from food alone that were above the UL were\nshown in ,0.5% of the adults studied. Although the prevalence\nof the total intake above the UL for minerals was close to zero\n(data not shown) in dietary supplement users, the prevalence of\ntotal intakes above the UL for calcium, iron, zinc, and magne-\nsium was higher (Table 3). In the adult population of supple-\nment users (when sexes were combined), ;6% of subjects\nexceeded the UL for calcium, ;9% of subjects exceeded the UL\nfor iron, ;9% of subjects exceeded the UL for zinc, and ;6% of\nsubjects exceeded the UL for magnesium (data not shown).

Older men were more\nlikely than were younger men to exceed the ULs for iron, zinc,\nand magnesium. About 7% of women who used dietary sup-\nplements exceeded ULs for calcium, iron, zinc, and magnesium.\nDISCUSSION\nIn general, dietary supplement users tended to have higher\nusual mean intakes of minerals from their diets than did nonusers,\nespecially in women. In men, mean intakes of magnesium,\ncopper, potassium, and selenium from food sources were sig-\nnificantly higher for users than for nonusers of supplements.\nHowever, only the prevalence of inadequate intakes was lower for\nmagnesium and copper. In men, the difference between dietary\nintakes in users and nonusers of supplements was most notable\nfor magnesium; a clear explanation of this finding was not ev-\nident. Stronger associations between higher mineral intakes from\nfoods and a lower prevalence of inadequate intakes were ob-\nserved in women. Women who used supplements were much less\nlikely to have inadequate magnesium and calcium intakes from\nfood sources than were nonusers. This finding was not surprising\nbecause many experts recommend that adult women consume\nand use supplemental calcium to lower risk of osteoporosis, and it\nis likely that women who use supplements are making dietary\nchoices aligned with this recommendation.\nCalcium is a nutrient of public health concern; recently, DRIs\nwere established on the strong evidence that calcium was related\nto bone health and risk of falls and fractures, particularly in older\nwomen (22). Calcium intakes of US adults remain below the\nrecommended intakes set forth by the DRI panel (22). For\nspectively, for individuals .51 y of age. For men, the EAR and\nrespectively, for individuals .70 y of age. Overall, 71% of\nnonusers and 24% of users of supplements had intakes below the\nEAR, including calcium intakes from the use of antacids and\nPrevalence of inadequate intakes assessed by using the EAR in adults (19 y of age) in the United States, 2003\u00ad20061\nMen Women\nNonusers Users-foods Users-total Nonusers Users-foods Users-total\n1 All values are percentages 6 SEs.

EAR, Estimated Average Requirement.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ncalcium that are in the water supply. In subjects .51 y of age,\nclose to 90% of nonusers and ;30% of users did not meet the\nEAR (Figure 1). Our data and those of others (9, 25) suggested\nthat the majority of older adults who do not use calcium-\ncontaining dietary supplements are not meeting their needs\nthrough the diet alone.\nWhen total intakes (diet and supplements) of users were\ncompared with dietary intakes of nonusers, users had signifi-\ncantly higher mean intakes than nonusers did across all age\ngroups and in both men and women. The use of dietary sup-\nplements did not substantially contribute to intakes of phosphorus\nand potassium, primarily because dietary supplements do not\ntypically contain large amounts of these minerals. In supplement\nusers, the prevalence of inadequate total intakes of calcium, iron,\nmagnesium, zinc, and copper was much lower than the preva-\nlence of inadequate intakes from food alone. However, even in\nusers of supplements, ;20% of US adults reported intakes be-\nlow the EAR for calcium and magnesium.\nErvin and Kennedy-Stephenson (25) examined NHANES III\nsupplement use. For calcium, dietary intakes were significantly\ndifferent for both men and women by supplement-use catego-\nries, whereas we only showed differences in women. We could\nnot directly compare our findings to the earlier NHANES III\ndata because we used different age groupings; however, dietary\nhigher than those of older adults in the NHANES III (25).\nErvin and Kennedy-Stephenson (25) also showed significant\ndifferences in iron intake from the diet for male supplement users\ncompared with male nonusers, whereas we did not observe these\ndifferences . Similar to the earlier report, we showed that dietary\nzinc intakes in older women supplement users were higher than in\nnonusers (see supplemental Table 1 under \"Supplemental data\"\ntotal dietary intakes were higher and the prevalence of in-\nadequate intakes were lower in older adults who used supple-\nments than in older adults who did not use supplements.\nApproximately 65% of adults who did use dietary supplements\nreported magnesium intakes from food sources that were below\nthe EAR. Inadequate iron intakes were not an issue in men,\nregardless of supplement use; however, 13\u00ad16% of adult women\nin the United States reported intakes that do not meet the EAR\nthrough the diet alone. For dietary supplement users, the prev-\nalence of inadequate intakes was virtually nonexistent for iron,\nzinc, phosphorus, copper, and selenium.\nThe finding that subjects who used mineral-containing\nsupplements already had higher mineral intakes from food\nsources alone is of public health relevance for 2 important\nreasons. First, dietary supplements may not be used by indi-\nviduals with the greatest need (ie, people with lowest dietary\nintakes). Conversely, supplement users represent a group who\nmay be at risk of exceeding the UL if their supplement intakes\ngreatly exceed RDA amounts. If other studies confirm this\nfinding, educational messages to limit total intakes to\nRDA amounts may be in order. The use of supplements did not\ngreatly move the distribution of intakes above the UL for\nphosphorus, copper, and selenium. However, the use of dietary\nsupplements did increase the prevalence of intakes above the UL\nfor calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc. High doses of calcium\nand iron may pose problems. The adverse effects of chronic\nexposure to high calcium intakes are an increase in the prevalence\nof kidney stones and hypercalcemia (22). Chronic iron excess is\nparticularly problematic because it can accumulate in the tissues\nand organs once storage sites are saturated (21). However, even at\nthe 90th percentile, users of iron-containing dietary supplements\nwere below the UL for iron (45 mg) for adults with the\nexception of men 71 y of age, whose 90th percentile of total\nusual iron intake was 75 mg (data not shown). The short-term\neffects of high zinc intakes are primarily related to gastroin-\ntestinal distress, whereas chronic high intakes of zinc may\nsuppress the immune response, decrease HDL-cholesterol con-\ncentrations, and may reduce copper status (ie, a decrease in\nerythrocyte copper-zinc superoxide dismutase). The UL for\nmagnesium was set from supplemental sources only; one\ncannot exceed the UL from the diet alone. The adverse effects of\nhigh intakes of magnesium are primarily related to gastroin-\ntestinal distress, such as cramping and diarrhea. It should be\nnoted that the prevalence of intakes above the UL reflects\na population perspective. It was not possible in this study to\ndetermine whether two 24-h dietary recalls were sufficient to\nidentify individuals who exhibited clinical signs or symptoms of\nexcess.\nFIGURE 2.

UL, tolerable upper intake level.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nDietary supplement use increases with age, whereas most\nmineral needs do not. Thus, older adults may be more likely to\nhave excessive total intakes for some minerals than do younger\npersons. Overall, 6% of adults had total usual calcium intakes\nabove the UL; however, the prevalence increased to almost 16%\ncontaining dietary supplements, the prevalence of usual intakes\nabove the UL for iron was almost 20%, and it was 16% for zinc.\nThe relatively high usual mineral intakes of these subgroups\nraise some potential safety concerns.\nA limitation of this report is that the estimates relied on self-\nreported dietary data for both nutrient intakes from foods and\ndietary supplements. The models that we applied also relied on\nassumptions that reported nutrient intakes from food sources on\nthe 24-h recalls were unbiased, and the self-reported dietary\nsupplement intake reflected the true long-term supplement in-\ntake. Furthermore, estimates of minerals contributed by dietary\nsupplements depended on the label declarations rather than\nanalytic values. The data presented in this manuscript should be\ninterpreted with these limitations in mind.\nDietary supplement use is common, particularly in older adults.\nThe most commonly used dietary supplements in the United States\nare multivitamin and mineral preparations. Ideally, formulations\nand amounts of minerals in these types of supplements should be\nused to help meet, but not exceed, DRI recommendations to best fit\nthe nutrient needs of adults (13). Our results confirmed previous\nfindings that individuals who use supplements tended to have\nhigher mineral intakes from diet alone, and they also had a lower\nprevalence of inadequate intakes than individuals who did not\nreport the use of mineral supplements. Thus, people who use\nmineral-containing supplements are, in many cases, already\nobtaining more of these nutrients from food sources in their diets\nthan are nonusers of mineral-containing supplements. Less than\n0.5% of US adults have dietary intakes above the UL recom-\nmendations; however, the use of dietary supplements increased the\nprevalence of total mineral intakes that were above the UL for\ncalcium, zinc, magnesium, and iron. These data support the\ncontention that diets of users of mineral-containing dietary sup-\nplements are different from nonusers, and from a public health\nstandpoint, the intakes of users of mineral-containing dietary\nsupplements need to be examined separately to best assess the role\nof nutrients on disease risk and health outcomes (26).\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--RLB and JTD: contributed\nto concept development and manuscript preparation; DRK: created data files\nfor demographic data and for food and supplements for the NHANES; VLF:\ncompleted analytical and statistical portions of this work; and all authors: read\nand approved the final version of the manuscript.
