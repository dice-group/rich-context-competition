Using more recent\nsurvey data from NHANES III and NHANES IV, we\nre-examined the validity of this relationship. Blood\npressure (BP) and nutrient intake data from 10,033 adult\nparticipants in NHANES III and 2311 adults in\nNHANES IV revealed findings similar to those of the\nearlier analysis, demonstrating that the association be-\ntween inadequate mineral consumption and higher BP is\nvalid and has persisted over two decades. Exploring this\nrelationship further, we separated untreated hyperten-\nsive persons by hypertension type (systolic, diastolic, or\nboth), and observed that the BP effect of low mineral\nintake was most pronounced in those with only systolic\nhypertension. We also observed that sodium intake was\nsignificantly lower in the systolic hypertension group\nand significantly higher in the diastolic hypertension\ngroup compared with the other groups. The nutrient\npattern in the combined hypertension group was similar\nto that of the normotensive group. These findings may\nhelp to explain the inconsistent responses generally\nobserved in dietary intervention studies, and they high-\nlight the possible importance of tailored nutritional rec-\nommendations for hypertension based on hypertension\ncategory and individual dietary practices. Although ran-\ndomized controlled trials are needed to characterize\nfurther the relationship between nutrient intake and\nhypertension type, these findings indicate that dietary\nmanagement of hypertension may be more effective if\nthe focus is on the overall nutritional profile rather than\nsingle-nutrient intake as currently recommended for\n\u00a9 2005 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.\nKey Words: Blood pressure, diet, systolic hyperten-\nsion, NHANES.\nAn analysis of the First National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES I) published\ncalcium and potassium as the mineral/electrolyte pattern\nthat best predicted the presence of hypertension, particu-\nlarly high systolic pressure, in adults. Among Americans,\na diet containing adequate intakes of dairy foods, fruits,\nand vegetables (similar to what has subsequently been\nlabeled the DASH diet2), was associated with the lowest\nblood pressure (BP) in NHANES I. Numerous population\nsurveys have confirmed the beneficial impact of dietary\ncalcium, as a surrogate for adequate mineral intake, on BP\nlevels in general3 and most consistently on systolic BP.4\nIn the 1984 analysis of NHANES I, higher levels of\ndietary sodium were not related to higher BP.1 As noted in\nthat report, the NHANES I data suggested the reverse, ie,\nBP tracked inversely with dietary sodium. Analyses by\nothers confirmed the findings that not only lower calcium\nbut also lower sodium intake was linked to higher BP in\nNHANES I.5 Similar observations have been reported\nFrom the University of California (MST, JSS, SA-A, DAMC),\nDavis, California; and Nutrition Impact LLC (VLF), Battle Creek,\nMichigan.\nThis work was supported by an education grant from Dairy Manage-\nment Inc., Rosemont IL.\nAddress correspondence to Dr. David A.

We hypothesized\nthat this relationship continues to exist and would be\nobserved again in more recent dietary survey data. Using\nship between the intake of dietary nutrients and BP levels\nin American adults. We extended the analysis to explore\nwhether sodium intake or BP category influenced this\nrelationship.\nMethods\nNational Surveys\nAs with the previous surveys, NHANES III and IV were\ndesigned to obtain a representative sample of the popula-\ntion in the United States using a complex, stratified, mul-\ntistage probability cluster sampling design.12,13 The\nsurveys consisted of partial probability samples of house-\nholds in the 48 contiguous states. Institutionalized and\nhomeless persons were not included. The NHANES III\nstudy was designed to be nationally representative for\neither 3 or 6 years of data collection, whereas NHANES\nIV was designed to give an annual sample that is nation-\nally representative.\nIn both surveys, adults responded to survey questions\nin home interviews. Interviewees were subsequently\nexamined in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) in\nexaminations lasting approximately 3 h. A modified\nhome examination was offered to a limited number of\nadults 60 years of age who could not come to the\nMEC. Both surveys over-sampled adults 60 years,\nMexican Americans, and African Americans to produce\nmore reliable estimates for these groups. For this study,\nonly adults examined in the MEC or at a modified home\nexamination were included. The Institutional Review\nBoard of the University of California at Davis reviewed\nthe protocol for this study.\nSample\nficient sample sizes for adults-only population subgroups\n(n  20,050) and then for adults with reliable dietary data\n(n  18,056). Although there was no upper age limit in\nNHANES III, we opted to use 75 years of age, similar to\nthe upper limit of 74 years used by McCarron et al1 for\nNHANES I, to enhance comparability of results. A final\nsample was generated to meet the following criteria: age\n20 to 75 years, not pregnant, and not lactating. As reported\nfor the previous article,1 we excluded persons who were\ncurrently taking medications for high BP or diabetes or\nwho had been told by a physician that they had hyperten-\nsion or diabetes (Table 1). Given that our analyses were\nrestricted to individuals without hypertension and the\nhigher risk of hypertension among non-Hispanic individ-\nuals of African American ethnicity, we eliminated a dis-\nproportionate number of non-Hispanic African Americans\nfrom the original sample.\nFor NHANES IV, the two annual data sets were com-\nbined (9650 individuals), producing an adults-only sample\nof 4706 with an examination at the MEC. A final sample\nwas generated to meet the same criteria mentioned above.\nComparable percentages of participants in both NHANES\nIII and IV were excluded based on a prior history of\nTable 1.

In total, approximately\n50% of the participants in both NHANES III and IV met\nthe inclusion criteria, resulting in final samples of 10,033\nNutrient Variables\nWe selected dietary factors commonly thought to influ-\nence BP by either direct or indirect means. Previous re-\nsearch was the basis for selection of two combination\nvariables: the combined mineral intake variable (potas-\nsium  calcium  magnesium) and the sodium/potassium\nratio variable.2,9,11 Those nutrients and nutrient variables\nare identified in Table 2.\nMeasurements\nThe average of BP measurements during the household\ninterview (n  3) and MEC examination (n  2) were\nused in NHANES III. For NHANES IV, the average BP\nreported to the examinee was used. For nutrient consump-\ntion, 24-h dietary recalls were analyzed for energy, pro-\ntein, carbohydrates, total fat, dietary fiber, and the\nmicronutrients calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium,\nphosphorus, iron, and vitamins C, E, and A. Calcium,\npotassium, and magnesium were combined for a mineral\nvariable, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio was calcu-\nlated. Hypertension categories were defined as follows:\n1) systolic pressure 140 mm Hg, also referred to as\nTable 2.

Appropriate statistical weights were used to adjust\nfor over-sampling of some groups and for nonresponse of\nsome individuals in NHANES III (WTPFHX6) and\nNHANES IV (WTMEC2YR). Means and standard errors\nwere calculated for the total sample and for the four BP\nsubgroups for demographic characteristics, BP, and\nmacro- and micronutrients. Regression analysis was used\nto examine differences between groups. Finally, multivar-\niate regression was used to determine whether unadjusted\neffects remained after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity,\nbody mass index (BMI), alcohol, and energy intake. Dif-\nferences were considered significant at values of P  .05.\nResults\nTable 2 compares the unadjusted nutrient profile and pop-\nulation characteristics for the normotensive compared with\nnewly diagnosed hypertensive participants in NHANES\nIII and IV. In both surveys, participants with hypertension\ndiffered significantly from normotensive persons in age\nand body mass index (BMI) (all P  .0001). The mean age\nof the hypertensive group was approximately 15 years\nolder than that of the normotensive group in NHANES III\nand 5 years older in NHANES IV. The BMI were approx-\nimately 2.5 kg/m2 larger in the hypertensive groups com-\npared with the normotensive groups in both surveys.\nReported calcium intake was significantly lower in hyper-\ntensive persons in NHANES III (P  .05) and marginally\nlower in NHANES IV (P  .052). Intakes of sodium,\npotassium, magnesium, phosphorus, protein, fat, carbohy-\ndrate, and alcohol did not differ between normal and\nhypertensive participants in either survey.\nTables 3 and 4 show the nutrient intakes of participants\nby category of BP: normal, systolic, diastolic, and both\nsystolic and diastolic hypertension. Participants with iso-\nlated systolic hypertension made up approximately 60% of\nthe hypertensive population, and this group was signifi-\ncantly older than the normotensive and the other hyper-\ntensive groups (Table 3). Compared with the normotensive\nand isolated systolic hypertension groups, the diastolic\nhypertension group was predominantly male (86%). The\ndiastolic hypertension\u00adonly and the combined hyperten-\nsion groups were more likely to be of non-Hispanic Afri-\ncan American ethnicity and to have higher BMI.\nVery importantly, the pattern of significantly lower\nmineral intake (potassium  calcium  magnesium)\nemerged as unique to persons with isolated systolic hy-\npertension in both NHANES III (Table 3) and NHANES\nIV (Table 4). This pattern was not observed among the\ndiastolic and combined hypertension groups. Consistent\nwith a dietary pattern of deficiencies rather than excesses,\nthe isolated systolic hypertension group also exhibited\nsignificantly lower intakes of energy, protein, carbohy-\ndrate, fat, and fiber in NHANES III. Lower intakes of\nenergy and carbohydrate were also evident in NHANES\nOf note, dietary sodium intake was also significantly\nlower in both NHANES III and IV in persons with isolated\nsystolic hypertension compared with the normotensive\nintake was significantly higher in the group with isolated\ndiastolic hypertension compared with the normotensive\nticipants with both elevated systolic and diastolic pres-\nsures exhibited a nutritional pattern similar to those with\nnormal BP. The BMI was significantly greater in the\ngroups with diastolic hypertension and combined systolic\nand diastolic hypertension compared with the normoten-\nsive and isolated systolic hypertension groups (NHANES\nIV).\nWhen adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, alcohol,\nand energy intake, the significant reductions in the com-\nbined mineral variable (potassium, calcium, and magne-\nsium intakes) persisted in the NHANES IV cohort of\nparticipants with isolated systolic hypertension (data not\nshown). In NHANES III, the multivariate adjustment\neliminated the significantly lower calcium intake. The\nadjustment for age accounted for the major impact on\ncalcium intake in the isolated systolic hypertension partic-\nipants. Of the macronutrient differences observed in the\ninitial analysis, the lower fiber intake remained significant\nfor the isolated systolic hypertension participants in the\nNHANES III cohort after adjusting for potential con-\nfounding variables (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis parallel analysis of nutrient intake and BP status from\nthe two most recent NHANES databases of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics supports a variety of previous\nobservations related to diet and BP regulation. In addition,\nit provides a potentially critical new insight regarding the\nsodium\u00adBP relationship. Our analyses confirm once again\nthat inadequate mineral intake (calcium, potassium, and\nmagnesium) is the dietary pattern that best predicts ele-\nvated BP in persons at increased risk for cardiovascular\ndisease--those with isolated systolic hypertension. Fur-\nthermore, the data indicate that this pattern has persisted\nacross three decades of federally sponsored NHANES\nsurveys and thus is clearly not simply a fleeting trend in\nthe United States. Instead, this observation represents a\nconsistent pattern of dietary intake, one characterized by\nlow intakes of dairy products, fruits, and vegetables.\nThe association between low mineral intake (calcium,\nTable 3.

Our data indi-\ncate just the opposite for persons at greatest cardiovascular\nrisk, namely, those with isolated systolic hypertension.14\nSodium intake is lower for those with isolated systolic\nhypertension compared with normotensive participants. In\nshow that the hypertensive category (NHANES I) and\nisolated systolic hypertensive category (NHANES III and\nIV) have significantly lower sodium intakes compared\nwith normotensive participants. In contrast, individuals\nwith elevated diastolic BP who also had higher mean BMI\ntended to report sodium intakes greater than those of\nnormotensive persons (P  .042, NHANES IV) and sig-\nnificantly higher sodium intakes than those of individuals\nwith isolated systolic hypertension (data not shown).\nThe negative association of minerals (potassium, cal-\ncium, magnesium) to isolated systolic hypertension did not\npersist in the multivariate analyses controlling for poten-\ntial confounding variables. Although age is a primary\nfactor influencing hypertensive states, there are one or\nmore characteristics of older study participants that cause\ntheir BP to be higher. Diet could certainly be that factor in\npart. This does not mean that mineral intakes are not\nimportant. In fact, evidence from the DASH trial shows\nthat they are important for BP control.2,10 Because of our\nsample size and statistical power, we could not stratify by\nage, gender, or ethnicity. However, our three-category\napproach for BP and stratification by these variables\nwould be beneficial in future work. Another finding among\nthose with isolated systolic hypertension, the lower fiber\nintake remaining significant after controlling for potential\nconfounding variables, is compatible with the reported low\nfruit and vegetable intakes by other researchers.2,9\u00ad11\nTo our knowledge, no published reports of the relation-\nship between nutrients or dietary patterns and BP status\nhave included analyses based on category of hypertension,\nie, systolic, diastolic, or the combination. Analysis by\nthese categories identified a new and potentially important\ndistinction among type of hypertension and dietary com-\nponents. In our analysis, dietary patterns differed signifi-\ncantly among BP categories. The nutritional pattern of\nlower intakes of all minerals including sodium and of\nmacronutrients is unique to persons with isolated systolic\nhypertension. This group comprises approximately 60% of\nthe hypertensive population in our samples. In contrast,\npersons with isolated diastolic hypertension demonstrate\nessentially the reverse pattern compared with individuals\nwith isolated systolic hypertension.\nThe decision to analyze data by three BP categories\nwarrants further comment. National treatment guidelines\nhave encouraged treatment regimens tailored to treat iso-\nlated systolic hypertension as a condition that is different,\nat least in part, from that of elevated diastolic or mean\narterial pressure. In our analysis, breaking this latter cat-\negory into two groups (isolated diastolic hypertension and\ncombined hypertension groups) may have revealed new\ninsights. First, we are not aware of previous analyses of\nobservational databases that have assessed whether iso-\nlated systolic hypertension is associated with a dietary\npattern that differs from that associated with increased\nmean arterial pressure, as in isolated diastolic hyperten-\nsion. Importantly, our findings from both NHANES III\nand IV suggest that dietary patterns do vary by BP cate-\ngory. Furthermore, they indicate that within the traditional\ncategory of elevated mean arterial pressure, dietary pat-\nterns may be distinguishable between patients with iso-\nlated systolic versus those with both diastolic and systolic\nBP elevations.\nThere are important interpretative limitations of this\ntype of analysis. The methods of documenting recent\ndietary intake are subject to substantial bias, most com-\nmonly that of under-reporting intake of calories and se-\nlected nutrients, specifically fat. That issue has been\ndocumented for NHANES III.15 Our data, however, pro-\nvide several worthwhile insights as to these posited limi-\ntations in recall methods as they might apply to our\nfindings. First, with the categorization of the BP status,\nBMI was significantly different among the groups. Those\nwith isolated systolic hypertension were leaner, with sig-\nnificantly low mean BMI, and reported intake of fewer\ncalories. The diastolic and mixed hypertension groups had\nhigher mean BMI within a range generally regarded as\noverweight. This pattern of reported intakes was associ-\nated with excess BMI. Thus, the differing dietary patterns\nthat we have observed do not appear to reflect under-\nreporting and are consistent with the notion that systolic\nhypertension is associated with a more normal BMI, older\nage, and lower caloric and nutrient intake.\nThese findings, as they relate to the putative association\nof dietary sodium intake to hypertension in the general\npopulation, provide a new perspective that may contribute\nto resolving the long-standing salt\u00adBP issue.16 Approxi-\nmately 60% of the participants identified as hypertensive\nin both NHANES III and IV had isolated systolic hyper-\ntension. In both surveys, these individuals reported signif-\nicantly lower sodium intakes. Approximately 20% of\nhypertensive participants in both NHANES III and IV had\nisolated diastolic hypertension. In NHANES IV these par-\nticipants had higher sodium intakes than normotensive\npersons. The same trend was apparent, although not sig-\nnificant, in NHANES III.\nThese various percentages of BP categories are consis-\ntent with the typical distributions of salt sensitivity re-\nported within the hypertensive population: ie, 60% to 70%\nare salt resistant and 30% to 40% salt sensitive. Based on\nour findings, the 60% of persons with newly diagnosed\nisolated systolic hypertension are unlikely to be salt sen-\nsitive, as their reported sodium intake is significantly less\nthan that of subjects with normal BP. In contrast, diastolic\nhypertension with concurrent excess BMI may well reflect\nsalt sensitivity, as sodium intake tends to be higher in these\nindividuals than in normotensive persons and is signifi-\ncantly higher than in those with isolated systolic hyper-\ntension.\nAlthough age, weight, ethnicity, and energy intake are\nknown confounders of the relationship between BP and\nnutritional patterns, our analyses add another dimension to\nthis relationship. Recognition that the association between\nspecific nutrients or foods and BP status in adults is not\nuniform across all categories of hypertension has both\nresearch and policy implications. The decades-long debate\nregarding higher sodium intake and increased hyperten-\nsion risk may be partially resolvable. Our data indicate that\neffects of sodium on BP are limited to those individuals\nwith isolated diastolic hypertension with its accompanying\nhigher BMI. Restricting sodium intake along with calories\nmay prove specifically effective for these at-risk individ-\nuals. Randomized trials targeting this specific category of\npatients with an intervention that limits both calories and\nsodium intake are needed to test this hypothesis.\nThere is substantial collateral evidence that individuals\nat greatest cardiovascular risk, namely, older persons with\nsystolic hypertension, will benefit from interventions that\nemphasize a dietary pattern that ensures adequate mineral\nconsumption (calcium, potassium, and magnesium) re-\ngardless of sodium intake. Analyses of the randomized\ntrials that have tested the BP effects of higher calcium or\nmineral intake have shown that the impact is greater and\nmore consistent on systolic than on diastolic pressure.8,17\nThese results are compatible with our findings. A prime\nexample of a test of this hypothesis is the Dietary Ap-\nproaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Trial.2 In the\ninitial report of that National Institutes of Health\u00adfunded\nstudy, a diet rich in minerals from dairy foods, fruits, and\nvegetables was found to be uniformly effective in lowering\nBP across all population groups, including hypertensive\nand normotensive individuals, and was independent of\nage, gender, and ethnicity as well as changes in weight or\nsodium intake.\nIn a subsequent report, the DASH diet combined with a\nnormal sodium intake was particularly effective in older\nindividuals with isolated systolic hypertension.18 Most\nrecently, Hajjar et al19 confirmed the specific impact on\nage-related increases in systolic pressure of a mineral-rich\ndiet in their analysis of NHANES III. A limitation of\nincluding patients with coronary heart disease and those\non special diets in our sample is that their inclusion may\nhave influenced both the dietary variables and the outcome\nvariable, the mean of the BP readings.\nSeveral meta-analyses of the trials of sodium restriction\nand BP have documented a heterogeneous effect on BP in\nthe general population.20\u00ad23 These analyses have typically\nindicated that the impact of restricting dietary sodium on\nBP is evident primarily in older persons with established\nhypertension. An intervention effect independent of so-\ndium restriction has been identified by several of these\nanalyses.20\u00ad22 Collectively, these findings of heterogeneity\nand isolated effects in subpopulations are consistent with\nour analysis of NHANES III and IV as well as analyses of\nNHANES I and NHANES I follow-up1,4,24 and support\nthe emerging concept that the impact of diet on BP regu-\nlation is not uniform across the adult population. Addi-\ntional analyses of available databases and appropriately\nstructured randomized control trials will be critical to\nassessing the clinical importance of the findings derived\nfrom our concurrent analysis of NHANES III and IV.\nIn conclusion, our findings have several important\nimplications for the prevention and management of\nhypertension and for future research initiatives. Clearly,\nthe development of hypertension management guide-\nlines in the future should be tailored to individual\npatients, as has generally been the approach with phar-\nmacologic management, and not applied uniformly\nacross all BP categories or groups at increased risk for\nhypertension. Furthermore, the emphasis of national\nnutrition policy on sodium restriction for hypertension\nis not consistent with these findings, identified in the\nfederally funded NHANES databases, and warrants\ncareful scientific evaluation.\nDietary interventions that improve overall diet quality\nby increasing the consumption of low-fat dairy foods,\nfruits, and vegetables, such as the DASH diet, have the\ngreatest likelihood of improving BP status. The heteroge-\nneity documented between BP status and nutrient intake in\nthis analysis likely accounts for a substantial portion of the\nheterogeneous responses that have been observed in ran-\ndomized controlled trials of diet modification for BP man-\nagement. Future intervention trials should address these\nsubstantial differences in nutritional intakes based on hy-\npertension category, particularly systolic hypertension,\nrather than presuming homogeneous effects of diet on\nregulation of arterial pressure.\nReferences\n1.
