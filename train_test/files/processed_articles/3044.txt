After controlling for several patient variables, psy-\nreuptake inhibitors accounted for approximately half of\nthe psychiatric visits with an antidepressant prescrip-\ntion. Increases in the rate of antidepressant prescription\nwere particularly evident for children and young adults;\nwhites; new patients; and patients with adjustment dis-\norders, personality disorders, depression not otherwise\nspecified or dysthymia, and some anxiety disorders.\nthere was a significant increase in the prescription of\nantidepressants by office-based psychiatrists. This in-\ncrease was greatest for patients with less severe psychi-\natric disorders.\nsuggests that the use of an-\ntidepressant medications is\nincreasing. A recently pub-\nlished household survey of\n2 New England communities revealed that\nuse increased almost 4-fold.1 In this study,\nthe growth in antidepressant use was great-\nest after fluoxetine hydrochloride first be-\ncame available in late 1987. Pharmacy pre-\nscriptions for antidepressants have\nfollowed a similar pattern: increasing only\nincreasing more rapidly toward the end of\nthe decade.3\nResearch on the prescribing prac-\ntices of office-based physicians provides ad-\nditional evidence for the increasing use of\nannual prescriptions of antidepressants by\noffice-based physicians in the United States\nfastest growth occurred among prescrip-\ntions written by psychiatrists.4 In contrast\ntothe steadyincrease inantidepressantpre-\nscriptions by psychiatrists, prescriptions of\nanxiolytic and antipsychotic medications\nby psychiatrists did not show consistent\ngrowth during this period.5\nIn the last few years, several devel-\nopments have focused renewed attention\non patterns of antidepressant use. First, the\narmamentarium of antidepressant medi-\ncations has continued to expand as newer\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n(SSRIs) and antidepressants with atypi-\ncal mechanisms of action have become\navailable, beginning with fluoxetine in late\npublic interest in antidepressants. Fluox-\netine and other newer antidepressants have\nbeen the topic of lead articles in national\nnews magazines,6 best-selling books,7 and\nwidely watched television talk shows.\nThird, drug companies have begun to\nmarket antidepressants and other pre-\nscription medications on television and\nin the lay press. Fourth, antidepressants\nare clinically useful in an expanding\nrange of psychiatric and general medical\ndisorders.8 In light of these develop-\nments, we sought to reexamine recent\ntrends in the prescription of antidepres-\nsants by psychiatrists in outpatient\npractice. We examine changes in the\ndemographic, patient payment, and\nclinical correlates of antidepressant pre-\nscription by psychiatrists in office-based\npractice.\nFrom the New York State\nPsychiatric Institute/\nDepartment of Psychiatry,\nCollege of Physicians &\nSurgeons of Columbia\nUniversity, New York\n(Dr Olfson); Western\nPsychiatric Institute and Clinic,\nPittsburgh, Pa (Mr Marcus);\nOffice of Research, American\nPsychiatric Association,\nWashington, DC (Drs Pincus\nand Zarin); and the Schools\nof Pharmacy and Medicine\n(Dr Zito) and the Department\nof Psychiatry, School of\nMedicine (Dr Thompson),\nUniversity of Maryland,\nBaltimore.\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

The present re-\nsurvey. Following NCHS recommendations, data from the\nbase on which to derive annual estimates.\nAttending physicians or their office staff completed a\n1-page data form for each visit during a specified 1-week\nperiod. The form contains items such as the patient's age,\nsex, race, payment sources, diagnoses, and medications, in-\ncluding new prescriptions (ordered, supplied, or admin-\nistered) and continuing medications (with or without new\norders).\nThe surveys were conducted via a 3-stage sampling\ndesign. First, a probability sample of 112 primary sam-\npling units (a county, a group of adjacent counties, or a\nstandard metropolitan statistical area) was drawn, next a\nprobability sample was drawn of practicing physicians\nwithin these primary sampling units, and finally a system-\natic random sample was drawn of the visits to these physi-\ncians. Physicians expecting more than 10 visits per day\nrecorded visits based on a predetermined sampling inter-\nval. Some patient duplication may occur with this survey\ndesign.\nThe current analysis is confined to visits to psychiatrists. Psy-\nchiatrists include physicians specializing in general psychia-\ntry or a psychiatric subspecialty such as child psychiatry or\n1994. Although the number of psychiatric visits is greater in\n(n=2703), the sampling weights described below adjust for\nthese differences to yield unbiased national estimates.\nAntidepressants\nAntidepressant drugs included tricyclic and tetracyclic an-\ntidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, atypical an-\ntidepressants (bupropion hydrochloride, trazodone hydro-\nchloride, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and nefazodone\nhydrochloride), and the SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline hy-\ndrochloride, and paroxetine hydrochloride. None of the\nSSRIs were licensed for use at the time of the 1985 survey.\nDemographic Characteristics\nData were collected on patient age, sex, and race as re-\nported by the physician.\nSource of Payment\nData were also collected on the sources and arrangements\nused to pay for the index visit: private insurance, public\ninsurance (Medicare or Medicaid), self-pay, prepaid plans,\nand a residual category that includes no charge and other\nsources.

These increases remained signifi-\ncant after adjustment for the confounding effects of de-\nmographic, payment, visit status, and diagnostic vari-\nables (Table 2).

There was a significant increase in the un-\nadjusted rate of antidepressant prescriptions for pa-\ntients with generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, other anxiety disorders, personality\ndisorders, childhood disorders and mental retardation,\nsubstance use disorders, adjustment disorders, and de-\npressive disorders other than major depressive disorder\nprovider organizations, and other prepaid arrangements.\nThe payment categories are not mutually exclusive.\nDiagnosis\nSome of the analyses involve aggregating visits into broad\ncategories by first-, second-, or third-listed diagnosis. These\ngroups, according to International Classification of Dis-\neases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, include major\nized anxiety disorder (300.02), obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder (301), disorders of childhood and mental retarda-\ncodiagnosis, these groups are not mutually exclusive.\nVisit Status\nThe surveys include a visit status variable that classifies pa-\ntients according to whether the physician (or another phy-\nsician in the same office) had ever seen the patient before.\nWe began by examining the demographic and diagnostic\ncomposition of psychiatric visits in the 2 survey periods.\nWe then examined the rate per 100 psychiatric visits of an-\ntidepressant prescriptions in each survey period. To ad-\njust for secular change in patient characteristics, we com-\nregression to evaluate the association between survey year\nand antidepressant prescription, controlling for patient age,\nsex, race, payment source, visit status, diagnostic group,\nand number of psychiatric diagnoses.\nThe rate of antidepressant prescription in each sur-\nvey period was determined stratified by demographic group,\npayment source, visit, diagnostic group, and number of di-\nagnoses. Logistic regressions were used to estimate rates\nof antidepressant prescription adjusted for the various de-\nmographic and clinical covariates.\nBecausethevisitsamplingisnotentirelyrandom,theNCHS\nweights each visit to inflate the sample and correct for sam-\npling imperfections. Census population estimates are used\nto compute the annual visit rate. Reported percentages are\nperiod represent the annualized mean of the 2 survey years.\nThe construction of weights has 3 components: (1) in-\nflation by reciprocals of sampling probabilities, (2) adjust-\nment for nonresponse, and (3) a ratio adjustment to fixed to-\ntals. The adjustment for nonresponse replaces patient visits\ntononrespondentswithvisitstorespondentsinthesamespe-\ncialty and same primary sampling unit.

These\nformulas were used to compute 95% CIs around the sur-\nvey estimates. In consultation with the NCHS, a statistical\nadjustment was used to prepare the data for the logistic re-\ngressions. This adjustment involves reducing the effective\nsample size of the survey to simulate sampling from a simple\nrandom sample. The weights were multiplied by an adjust-\nment factor calculated by dividing the sum of poststratifi-\ncation weights by the sum of the squared poststratifica-\ntion weights.10 This procedure yields conservative estimates\nthat tend to overcompensate for stratification artifacts.11\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

For adjustment disorders, personality disor-\nders, and the other anxiety and depressive disorders cat-\negories, these increases remained significant after con-\ntrolling within and across survey year for the confounding\neffects of demographic variables, expected payment\nsource, and other clinical factors (Table 3).\ndepressant medication mentions were nearly evenly di-\nreceive an SSRI. The most commonly prescribed antide-\nodone (9.4%), and nortriptyline hydrochloride (7.0%).\nPatients whose first-listed diagnosis was a less se-\nvere disorder (ie, an adjustment disorder, a depressive\ndisorder other than major depressive disorder, or an \"other\nmental disorder\") were significantly more likely to re-\nCOMMENT\nbased psychiatric visits that included an antidepressant\nprescription more than doubled. This increase devel-\noped at a time when other important changes were also\noccurring in the composition of office-based psychiatric\npractice. In line with broader demographic trends,12 there\nwas an increase in the proportion of psychiatric visits by\nolder patients and racial minorities. Psychiatric practice\nalso became more dependent on public sources of reim-\nbursement and prepaid arrangements.13 Shorter epi-\nsodes of outpatient psychiatric care14 resulted in propor-\ntionately more visits by patients who had not been\npreviously seen by the treating psychiatrist.\nBetween the surveys, there were also significant\nchanges in the recorded clinical diagnoses.

Without an independent, objective assessment, it\nis not possible to determine the sources of these changes.\nOne possibility is that shifts in the clinical diagnostic pro-\nfile reflect true secular change in the treated prevalence\nof these disorders.

In evaluating antidepressant prescribing\ndifferences between the 2 surveys, it is important to bear\nin mind these differences between the 2 samples.\nOne of the most dramatic increases in antidepres-\nsant prescription occurred among children and adoles-\ncents. Approximately 3 of every 10 child or adolescent\nantidepressant prescription. A depressive disorder was\ndiagnosed in 59% of these visits.\nThe widespread prescription of antidepressants to\nchildren and adolescents is a relatively new phenom-\nenon. Earlier research indicates a much lower rate of an-\ntidepressant prescription.20,21 For example, Kaplan and\ncoworkers20 found that only 4.2% of children seen at a\nuniversity-based child psychiatric clinic during 1989 were\nprescribed an antidepressant. A recently published sur-\nvey revealed that the average British child psychiatrist\nstarts antidepressant therapy in only 1 or 2 children each\nEvidence for the efficacy of antidepressant therapy\nin childhood and adolescent major depressive disorder\nis uneven.22,23 Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies\nexamining the treatment of adolescents with major de-\npressive disorder indicate no or only limited benefits from\nantidepressant therapy.24-28 Moreover, a recent meta-\nanalysis uncovered serious methodological flaws in pub-\nlished studies of antidepressant use among children and\nadolescents.29 Given the apparent gap between current\ntreatment practices and existing empirical evidence, con-\ntinued research on the efficacy and effectiveness of an-\ntidepressants in the treatment of psychiatric disorders in\nchildren and adolescents remains a high priority.\nAntidepressant prescription has also markedly in-\ncreased to psychiatric patients with less severe disor-\nders. A significant increase in the antidepressant pre-\nscription rate was observed for patients diagnosed as\nhaving adjustment disorders and less severe anxiety dis-\norders. The frequent prescription of SSRIs to patients with\nless severe disorders suggests that the introduction of\nmedications with fewer adverse effects has lowered the\nthreshold for antidepressant prescribing.\nConsiderable public and professional controversy\nsurrounds the use of antidepressants in the treatment of\nsuch minor conditions.30-32 There is a concern that anti-\ndepressants are being used to treat conditions that might\nrespond to simple supportive psychological interven-\ntions alone. Although antidepressants have been shown\nto be effective in mild forms of major depression,33,34 their\nproper role in the treatment of less consequential syn-\ndromes is less clear. In evaluating the reported use of an-\ntidepressants in patients with minor psychiatric condi-\ntions, it is important to consider the following possibilities:\ndeliberate undercoding of depressive disorders to re-\nduce stigma or future insurance eligibility35; appropri-\nate prescription of antidepressants to treat general medi-\ncal problems (eg, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and\ngastritis); the use of sedating antidepressants as hypnot-\nics; and the poor specificity of the diagnostic categories\n(eg, depression not otherwise specified vs adjustment dis-\norder with depressed mood).\nTHERE IS substantialevidencesupportingthe\nrole of antidepressants in the treatment of\npanic disorder,36,37 obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder,38 some personality disorders,39\nand enuresis.40 There is also some evi-\ndence that antidepressants may be useful in the treat-\nment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder41 and de-\npressed adult patients with alcohol use disorders42 and\nin the maintenance of alcohol43 and cocaine44 absti-\nnence. For these conditions, the recent increases in an-\ntidepressant prescription may represent a response to pub-\nlished experimental clinical data.\nPsychiatric patients diagnosed as having major de-\npressive disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder did\nnot experience a significant increase in the rate of anti-\ndepressant treatment. Although antidepressants are ef-\nfective in treating patients with major depressive disor-\nder and certain phases or subtypes of schizophrenia45,46\nand bipolar disorder,47 the availability of newer agents\nwith fewer adverse effects did not significantly increase\nantidepressant treatment of patients with these more se-\nvere disorders. The pharmacological advantages of the\nnewer antidepressants may tend to exert a greater effect\nin treatment decisions for patients with less severe psy-\nchopathologic disorders. The more favorable adverse ef-\nfect profile and the greater safety of SSRIs when taken in\noverdose may also help to explain why psychiatrists have\nbecome more willing to prescribe antidepressants to out-\npatients during their initial office visits.\nComparing across payment sources, prepaid insur-\nance was associated with higher use of antidepressants.\nCompared with psychiatrists in fee-for-service practice,\nthose in prepaid settings may be selectively referred\ncases for medication management or may tend to first\nsee patients later in the course of illness,48 when symp-\ntoms are more severe and a greater use of antidepres-\nsants is clinically indicated. In addition, many prepaid\nhealth plans limit psychiatrists' practices to medication\nmanagement.\nIn the present study, nonwhite psychiatric patients\ndid not have a significant increase in antidepressant pre-\nscriptions. Several other investigators have reported a rela-\ntively low rate of antidepressant prescription in black pa-\ntients.49,50 In 1 study, the pairing of black patients and\nwhite clinicians was associated with a lower antidepres-\nsant treatment rate than the pairing of black patients and\nblack clinicians.51 The possibility that racial factors af-\nfect antidepressant prescribing requires further investi-\ngation. It is possible that patient and provider attitudi-\nnal factors mediate the observed racial disparity in\nantidepressant use.\nThe NAMCS is limited in many ways. It does not\nprovide critical information about the duration or dos-\nage of the antidepressant medication trials, the specific\ncondition for which the medication is prescribed, or treat-\nment response. Another limitation is the uncertain reli-\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nability of diagnoses established by practicing physi-\ncians. It is possible, for example, that the observed increase\nin antidepressant prescription is a response to a secular\nincrease in illness severity within diagnostic groups. There\nis also no information on the large number of psychia-\ntrists who work outside of office-based practice set-\ntings.52 Despite these significant limitations, the NAMCS\nprovides the only currently available source of nation-\nally representative data concerning the prescribing prac-\ntices of physicians in office-based practice.\nIn less than a decade, the proportion of psychiatric\noutpatient visits that include an antidepressant prescrip-\nhalf of all such visits included an antidepressant pre-\nscription. Although some of this increase seems to be an\nappropriate response to the availability of safer agents\ncombined with the results of well-controlled research,\nsome of the increase may be based on less secure evi-\ndence.\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Van Am-\neringen Foundation to the American Psychiatric Associa-\nof Health, Bethesda, Md (Dr Olfson).\nThe authors are grateful to Terri Tanielian, MA, for\nher administrative assistance and to Catharine W.
