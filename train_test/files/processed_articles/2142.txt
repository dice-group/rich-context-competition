    "reduced_content": "Commentary on Pedersen and Skardhamar (2010): Does cannabis use predict\nnon-drug offending?\nThe paper by Pedersen & Skardhamar [1] is an excellent\ncontribution to knowledge.They use data from theYoung\nin Norway Longitudinal Study, which is an extremely\nimportant four-wave population survey. They show that\ncannabis use at ages 15 and 20 years predicts subsequent\noffending, but that the predictability is greater for drug\ncrimes than for non-drug crimes. They also show that\nthe predictability for non-drug crimes becomes non-\nsignificant after controlling for prior risk factors, alcohol\nintoxication and use of other illegal drugs. The analyses\nare neat and clear. While generally welcoming this excel-\nlent paper I wish to raise some issues, and I will divide\nthese into `methodological' and `substantive'.\nThe most important methodological issue is attrition.\nAccording to Pedersen et al. [2], a nationally represen-\ntative sample of seventh and eighth grade students was\nsurveyed, using a self-administered questionnaire, in\n[at Time 1 (T1)] because of poor reading skills and 3.0%\nof the remainder were lost because of lack of student or\nparent consent or prolonged hospitalization. Of those\nwho completed the T1 questionnaire, 91.6% completed\nthe T2 questionnaire. According to Pedersen [3], of\nthose who completed the T2 questionnaire, 90.4% con-\nsented to be followed-up further. Of those consenters,\nAccording to my estimate, about 65% of the original\nvided data at T4. Similarly, we are told that the cumu-\nlative response rate over all data collections was 69%,\nbut this could possibly correspond to about 55% of the\noriginal sample.\nThis is a good response rate for a mail follow-up study,\nbut of course the problem is that those who are lost tend\nto be the high-risk students: male, with poor school\ngrades, urban residence, and so on [1,3]. Commendably,\nPedersen & Skarohamar estimate that the serious offend-\ning rate in their sample is about one-third less than in the\npopulation (7.8% compared to 11.6%, presumably up to\nage 27 years). However, the high and biased attrition rate\nmay threaten the validity of the conclusions.\nIn the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development\n(CSDD), 411 London males have been followed-up from\nage 8 to age 48, using repeated personal interviews [4].\nThe attrition rate in this study was very low; the percent-\nage of those still alive who were interviewed was 95% at\nthe males who were the most difficult to interview were\nsignificantly more likely to be convicted [5], showing that\nconclusions about predictors of offending in studies with\nhigh attrition rates might be misleading.\nThe second important methodological issue, which is\nrelated to some extent to the first, is that the number of\nages 20\u00ad27. This may make it difficult to obtain statisti-\ncally significant results even if effect sizes are substantial.\nAlthough the male : female ratio for offending is high\nin all the analyses, presumably because of the problem of\nsmall numbers. It is not clear to me why gender (and age)\nwere not controlled in the Table 3 logistic regression\nanalyses.\nThemainconclusionof thepaperisthatcannabisusedoes\nnot predict non-drug offending significantly after control-\nling for confounding factors. I am somewhat dubious\nabout controlling for other drug use in model 3, because it\ncould be argued that cannabis use and other drug use are\nboth indicators of the same underlying construct. In the\nCSDD, there was a considerable overlap between cannabis\nand other drug users; the percentage of other drug users\nweseenon-significantoddsratios(ORs)of theorderof 2.0\nfor the relationship between cannabis use and non-drug\noffending.AccordingtothePresidentialAddressbyCohen\n[6, p. 136], `the field of epidemiology tends to regard OR of\n2.0 or more as fairly large'.\nA fairly strong relationship that is non-significant\nseems somewhat inconclusive to me, and not a very firm\nbasis for the main conclusion of the paper that `the use of\ncannabis does not seem to represent a risk factor for a\ngeneral criminal involvement'. The systematic review by\nBennett et al. [7] was inconclusive in the opposite direc-\ntion: the weighted mean OR for cannabis was a rather\nweak 1.5, but it was statistically significant (because it\nwas based upon an accumulation of results obtained in\n10 different studies). The main conclusion from the sys-\ntematic review is that heroin, cocaine and crack were\nmore strongly related to criminal behaviour than was\ncannabis.\nCOMMENTARY\nIn the CSDD, cannabis use at age 18 significantly pre-\ndicted non-drug convictions between ages 19 and 32\n[39% of users were convicted, compared with 24% of\nHowever, after controlling for prior convictions between\nages 10 and 18 in a logistic regression, the prediction\nbecame non-significant (partial OR = 1.4), in agreement\nwith the conclusions of Pedersen & Skarohamar [1].\nCannabis use at age 32 predicted non-drug convictions\nwere convicted, compared with 9% of non-users;\ndictability of cannabis use at age 32 held up after con-\nheavy smoking, heavy drinking and binge drinking up\nto age 32, and age 8\u00ad10 risk factors that were the best\npredictors of non-drug convictions at ages 33\u00ad50. It\nmay be that cannabis use predicts non-drug convictions\nmore strongly at older ages than at younger ages, in\nagreement with findings in the systematic review by\nBennett et al. [7].\nAnother issue that might be raised centres upon the\nvalidity of the self-report information. The fact that can-\nnabis use predicts later drug charges might be cited as\nevidence of the predictive validity of the self-reports. A\nfinal problem is that both cannabis use and non-drug\noffending vary continuously as people grow older. In the\nabsence of frequent repeated survey information, it is dif-\nficult to investigate whether cannabis use has any causal\neffect on non-drug crime. Ideally, it would be desirable to\ninvestigate whether changes in cannabis use within indi-\nviduals were followed reliably by changes in non-drug\noffending within individuals, after controlling for con-\nfounding factors.\nTo conclude, the paper by Pedersen & Skardhamar [1]\nreports interesting and thought-provoking results from a\nvery important prospective longitudinal survey of drug\nuse and offending. Many more surveys of this kind are\nneeded, with large samples, low attrition and frequent\ndata collection.\nDeclaration of interests\nNone.\nKeywords Cannabis, longitudinal survey, offending.\nInstitute of Criminology, Cambridge University,\nCambridge, UK.
