Cox proportional hazards models with time-\ndependent covariates were used to estimate the risk for\nonset of panic attacks associated with prior smoking and\nvice versa, controlling for history of major depression.\nThe role of lung disease in the smoking\u00adpanic attacks as-\nsociation was explored.\nResults: Daily smoking signaled an increased risk for\nfirst occurrence of panic attack and disorder; the risk was\nhigher in active than past smokers. No significant risk\nwas detected for onset of daily smoking in persons with\nprior panic attacks or disorder. Exploratory analyses sug-\ngest that lung disease might be one of the mechanisms\nlinking smoking to panic attacks.\nConclusions: The evidence that the association\nbetween smoking and panic disorder might result pri-\nmarily from an influence in one direction (ie, from\nprior smoking to first panic attack) and the possibility\nof a higher risk in active than past smokers suggest a\ncausal hypothesis for the smoking\u00adpanic attacks rela-\ntionship.\nEPIDEMIOLOGIC studies have\nreported positive associa-\ntions between smoking and\npsychiatric disorders,1-4 con-\nfirmingpreviousreportsthat\nthe rate of smoking is higher in patients\nwith psychiatric disorders, including de-\npressive and anxiety disorders.5 The rela-\ntionship between smoking and major de-\npression has been the focus of considerable\nresearch.6-13 In contrast, little is known\nabout the relationship of smoking with\npanic disorder, beyond the observation of\npositive associations.

Daily\nsmoking might cause panic attacks; con-\nversely, panic attacks might increase the\nrisk for daily smoking. Alternatively, the\nassociation might be noncausal: smoking\nand panic attacks might be linked by\nshared etiologies. Although observa-\ntional studies cannot definitively test causal\nhypotheses, they can dampen the plausi-\nbility of some hypotheses and suggest the\nplausibility of others. Evidence that daily\nsmoking is associated with an increased\nrisk for first panic attack but no in-\ncreased risk in the reverse direction (ie,\nfrom panic attacks to onset of daily smok-\ning) would dampen the plausibility that\npanic increases the risk for smoking. It\nwould suggest the hypothesis that daily\nsmoking causes panic attacks, although the\nplausibility of shared causes could not be\nruled out. Furthermore, evidence of a\ngreater risk for panic attacks in active\nsmokers than in those who have quit\nwould dampen the plausibility of the\nshared causes explanation. In contrast, evi-\ndence of influences in both directions and\nevidence of an equally increased risk for\npanic attacks in smokers who quit and\nthose who continued to smoke would sug-\ngest the hypothesis that the observed as-\nsociation reflects common causes.\nFrom the Departments of\nPsychiatry, Henry Ford Health\nSystem, Detroit, Mich,\nUniversity of Michigan School\nof Medicine, Ann Arbor, and\nCase Western Reserve\nUniversity School of Medicine,\nCleveland, Ohio (Dr Breslau);\nand the College of Physicians\nand Surgeons, Columbia\nUniversity, and the New York\nState Psychiatric Institute,\nNew York (Dr Klein).\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association.

(2) Is the risk for first panic attack greater in per-\nsons who continue to smoke than in those who have quit?\n(3) Does a history of panic attacks signal an increased\nrisk for daily smoking? To each data set, we apply the\nsame statistical methods that take advantage of informa-\ntion on the timing of onset of daily smoking and first oc-\ncurrence of panic attack.

The\nTobacco Supplement was administered in the second half\nof the survey. Data are available on 4411 respondents of\nthe total NCS sample of 8098.

This was caused pri-\nmarily by the longitudinal design of the Epidemiologic\nStudy of Young Adults--multiple follow-up assess-\nments added incidence cases that occurred during suc-\ncessiveintervals.Atbaseline,theprevalenceestimateswere\nsimilar to those in the NCS. Despite these and other dif-\nferences between the 2 studies, both lead to similar in-\nferences with respect to the relationship between daily\nsmoking and panic attacks or disorder.\nIn this study, we examined the relationship of daily\nsmoking with panic attack and panic disorder. While his-\ntory of panic attack defines a heterogeneous category that\nincludesthosewithahistoryofasingleisolatedattack,panic\ndisorderdefinesamoredistinctclinicalphenomenon.Time\nof onset of panic disorder was defined as first occurrence\nof panic attack in persons meeting the DSM-III-R criteria\nfor the disorder. The age at which the full criteria were first\nmet is not ascertained in the Diagnostic Interview Sched-\nule or the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\nHowever, first panic attack might be the most reliably re-\ncalled by persons with panic disorder.\nThe results suggest the possibility that the relation-\nship between smoking and panic attack or disorder might\nflow primarily in one direction (ie, from smoking to sub-\nsequent onset of panic attacks or disorder). Evidence sug-\ngesting an influence in the reverse direction (ie, an in-\ncreased risk for daily smoking in persons with panic\nattacks), was suggested in the NCS, but the risk was\nsmaller and not significant. Results from the Epidemio-\nlogic Study of Young Adults show increased risk for panic\nattack and disorder in active smokers but not in past\nsmokers. Corresponding results from the NCS, al-\nthough consistent with this pattern, were less clear-cut.\nThe evidence that smoking cessation diminished the risk\nfor panic attacks and disorder should be interpreted with\ncaution.\nAlternative hypotheses that link smoking to panic\nattacks have been suggested.14 One potential mecha-\nnism explored in this study is lung disease. The data on\nthis issue have important limitations, including reliance\non self-reports of lung disease and lack of information\non the time of onset of lung disease relative to first panic\nattack. The results from both data sets show an in-\ncreased lifetime prevalence of panic attacks in smokers\nwho reported lung disease compared with smokers who\ndid not. Among nonsmokers, lung disease was associ-\nated with an increased risk of panic attacks, confirming\nprevious reports.20-22 By increasing the risk for lung dis-\nease, smoking might indirectly increase the risk for panic\nattacks. However, the fact that only a small proportion\nof smokers reported lung disease and the increased in-\ncidence of panic attacks/disorder in smokers with no his-\ntory of lung disease suggest the possibility of other path-\nways from smoking to panic.\nTable 3.

Smokers with pulmonary problems who are pre-\ndisposed to overreact to suffocation signals might manifest\npanic attacks. Alternatively, carbon monoxide in ciga-\nrette smoke might affect the suffocation alarm thresh-\nold. It has been suggested36 that one asphyxiation moni-\ntor for the suffocation alarm system may be the carotid\nbody, which is inhibited by carbon monoxide.37 Such a\ndirect effect would decrease the alarm reaction in smok-\ners; however, rebound receptor sensitization effects caused\nby smoking pauses may also occur. Other causal mecha-\nnisms in the smoking-panic relationship, including a role\nfor smoking and nicotine in anxiety, also should be con-\nExperimental research that could provide defini-\ntive evidence for ruling out noncausal explanations of\nthe association between smoking and panic and for\nestablishing the role of compromised lung function as\na mechanism is not feasible in humans. However, it\nseems clear that longitudinal epidemiological investi-\ngations can go beyond cross-sectional associations in\ninfluencing the plausibility of competing hypotheses.\nClinical research in panic disorder has benefited from\nexperiments in which patients have been perturbed by\nboth psychological and physiological stimuli. Further\nclarification might be gained if stimuli such as carbon\ndioxide or intravenous sodium lactate were applied to\nsubjects with and without panic attacks, who also var-\nied with regard to smoking status. Also, longitudinal\nstudies with repeated administration of such stimuli in\nsubjects at high risk for progression to heavy smoking\ncould test if smoking induces panic by stimulating a\npreexisting hypersensitive suffocation alarm system or\nmay actually induce such hypersensitivity.\nA comment on the statistical analysis of the NCS\ndata is in order. Prevalence estimates and measures of\nlifetime associations, the latter calculated in logistic\nregression models, were based on weighted data to\nadjust for the complex sampling design (Tables 1 and\n3). To estimate the risk for first occurrence of panic\nattack associated with prior daily smoking and to\naddress other questions that concern temporal rela-\ntionships between variables, Cox proportional hazards\nmodels with time-dependent covariates were applied\nto unweighted data. To our knowledge, there is no\nsoftware for the analysis of weighted data in the Cox\nproportional hazards model with time-dependent\ncovariates. The discrete-time logistic model, for which\nsoftware procedures for weighted data are available,\nhas been used to address similar questions.41,42 This\napplication of the discrete-time logistic model to inter-\nval censored data, such as those produced by the Diag-\nnostic Interview Schedule or the Composite Interna-\ntional Diagnostic Interview (which date events by year\nof occurrence), has been questioned recently by Hos-\nmer and Lemeshow.43 We evaluated the effects of\nweighting by applying the discrete-time logistic mod-\nels to the unweighted and the weighted data. A com-\nparison of the results with those that appear in Table 2\nshows only a few differences. Specifically, the relative\nrisk estimate for panic disorder associated with prior\ndaily smoking was higher in the discrete-time logistic\ned data). The estimate of the relative risk for daily\nsmoking associated with prior panic attack in the\ndiscrete-time logistic model was slightly higher and\nweighted data). The discrepancies in both instances\noccurred in the shift to the discrete-time logistic\nmodel, whereas the use of weights had little added\neffect. It is therefore unlikely that any bias in our esti-\nmates from the Cox proportional hazards models cal-\nculated on the unweighted data would be more than\nminimal.\nThis study was supported in part by grants MH 48802\n(Dr Breslau) and MH 30906 (Dr Klein) from the National\nInstitute of Mental Health, Rockville, Md.\nThe statistical advice of Lonni Schultz, PhD, Ed Pe-\nterson, PhD, and Gary Chase, PhD, is gratefully acknowl-\nedged.\nCorresponding author: Naomi Breslau, PhD, Depart-\nment of Psychiatry, Henry Ford Health System, 1 Ford Pl,\nREFERENCES\n1.
