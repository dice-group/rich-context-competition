    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper examines one of the historical antecedents of Big Data, the social physics movement. Its origins are in the\nscientific revolution of the 17th century in Western Europe. But it is not named as such until the middle of the 19th\ncentury, and not formally institutionalized until another hundred years later when it is associated with work by George\nZipf and John Stewart. Social physics is marked by the belief that large-scale statistical measurement of social variables\nreveals underlying relational patterns that can be explained by theories and laws found in natural science, and physics in\nparticular. This larger epistemological position is known as monism, the idea that there is only one set of principles that\napplies to the explanation of both natural and social worlds. Social physics entered geography through the work of the\nmid-20th-century geographer William Warntz, who developed his own spatial version called ``macrogeography.'' It\ninvolved the computation of large data sets, made ever easier with the contemporaneous development of the computer,\njoined with the gravitational potential model. Our argument is that Warntz's concerns with numeracy, large data sets,\nmachine-based computing power, relatively simple mathematical formulas drawn from natural science, and an isomorph-\nism between natural and social worlds became grounds on which Big Data later staked its claim to knowledge; it is a past\nthat has not yet passed.\n",

Instead, our aim is much more\nmodest. It is to set out historically only one of the ante-\ncedents of Big Data: social physics. We suggest that\nsocial physics is connected to Big Data historically\nthrough spatial analysis: social physics, as we will\nargue, influenced spatial analysis, and spatial analysis\nwas then incorporated into Big Data.\nWe recognize that not all spatial analysis derives\nfrom social physics, however. For example, within spa-\ntial analysis there is the long tradition of German loca-\ntion theory that includes von Thu\n\u00a8 nen, Weber,\nChristaller, and Lo\n\u00a8 sch that doesn't subscribe to social\nphysics at all (Barnes, 2003). The underlying rationales\nfor the individual works comprising the German\nlocational tradition vary with the particular author,\nand are also bound up with the historical and geo-\ngraphical context in which the particular theory was\ndevised (Barnes, 2003). In none of these cases is social\nphysics the motivation, though. But there is a strand of\nspatial analysis that comes from social physics, and\nwhich in turn has shaped contemporary practices of\nGIScience and Big Data (see Anselin, 2012;\nthat practices of exploratory data analysis, pattern rec-\nognition, and data mining within GIScience and Big\nData, which have produced such analytical outcomes\nas prediction, modelling, intelligence, and design, stem\nin part from an earlier spatial analysis and social phys-\nics. This is not to preclude other influences on Big Data\nand other forms of spatial analysis, but it is to make\nthe connections between social physics and spatial ana-\nlysis explicit.\nSocial physics is a long-standing interdisciplinary\nmode of inquiry. From the beginning it was driven by\na belief that laws, theories, and models of physics\napplied as much to social as to natural worlds. This\nview is known as monism, the idea that theories of\nphysics explain both human and non-human worlds\n(and also represented by the chutzpah found in our\npaper's epigraph). The origins of monism are in\nAncient Greece, but social physics as a specific form\nof enquiry did not emerge until the 17th century in\nWestern Europe. Following several hundred years of\nfits and starts, social physics was finally institutiona-\nlized in the 1940s, the result of the energetic efforts of\na motley of American academics of which the two most\nSocial physics entered geography in the mid-1950s\nthrough the American geographer William Warntz\nof the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics\nand Spatial Analysis. Warntz, who collaborated with\nStewart early on, emphasized the importance of recog-\nnizing general geographical patterns through the spatial\nanalysis of large sets of geo-coded data. He thought\nthose patterns were best represented and explained by\nmodels and theories of physics, particularly the\nNewtonian (Lagrangean) potential model (Rich,\n1980).1 That is, his spatial analysis was based on\nsocial physics. To that end, Warntz made literally bil-\nlions of calculations during the course of his career. At\nfirst, a small proportion were by hand using mechanical\ncalculators and taking months of his life. Later, and by\nfar the bulk, were undertaken by a computer first in\nonly a few hours, which diminished to minutes, then\nto seconds. Those calculations were the bases of count-\nless contour surfaces of population potential that\nWarntz made for the United States. On one occasion,\nWarntz even made a 3-D version on his dining\nroom table, constructed from plywood, plaster of\nParis and many, many nails, each one standing at\nexactly in the right spot and at the right population\npotential height.2\nIn telling historical stories of social physics, and par-\nticularly of Warntz's work within that tradition, we are\nnot claiming that social physics is the equivalent to\nwhat now passes as Big Data, or even that it is its\nembryonic version. It is more complicated. The work\nthat Warntz did, as well as other social physicists on\nwhom he drew, contained some of the elements that\nwere later incorporated into Big Data via advance-\nments in spatial analysis, providing one of its proving\ngrounds, helping to shape its formulations and prac-\ntices. Our larger point is that Big Data and its use in\ngeography didn't start de novo, from scratch, after the\nrubble of the past was cleared away. It was erected on\nthat past, which consequently must be examined.\nHistorical foundations of social physics\nIn an early study, Sorokin (1928: 3) argued that the\nintellectual foundation of social physics was the\nAncient Greek philosophical idea of monistic material-\nism in which ``psychical and social phenomena [were]\nmere variations of natural phenomena.'' As a result,\nregularities and laws found to hold for natural phenom-\nena applied equally as forcefully to social phenomena.\nNatural and social worlds were isomorphic: one world,\none set of principles.\nMonistic materialism, thought Sorokin (1928),\nbecame especially important from the 17th century\nwith the beginning of the scientific revolution in\nWestern Europe. That revolution was defined in part\nby the use of mathematics. Galileo famously said in the\nearly 17th century that the Book of Nature was\n2 Big Data & Society\n``written in the language of mathematics,'' and ``with-\nout [it] one wander[ed] about in a dark labyrinth''\nto nature, it therefore followed that the social should be\nwritten in mathematics too. That was what social phys-\nics did. It strove to convert all forms of society into\nnumbers, using mathematics to shed light on its own\ndim labyrinthine corners. In some cases, leading scien-\ntists also became leading social physicists. For example,\nturned his astrophysical skills in the early 18th century\nto the life insurance business, using his mathematical\nexpertise to invent actuarial science by setting out stat-\nistical regularities from a large-scale analysis of mortal-\nity data. In other cases, concern was with only the\ntical data on disease, laying down an intellectual basis\nfor epidemiology. And Graunt's contemporary, Sir\nnational statistics of income and wealth, providing a\nfoundation for the ``dismal science.'' According to\nlarge-scale numerical data compilation and analysis\nrepresented early examples of ``social physics.''\nNot that ``social physics'' yet existed as a name.\nWhen it finally arrived, it was in French: ``physique\nsociale.'' The Belgian astronomer, statistician, and\nsocial tabulator Adolphe Quetelet coined the term in\n1835 in his book Sur l'Homme.3 Specifically, Quetelet\nassembled a large data set of Parisian crime figures,\nsubjecting it to a demanding social statistical analysis,\nmaking scientific predictions of ``terrifying exactitude''\nbecause, following the monistic line, he believed social\nlife was governed by statistical laws revealed by apply-\ning the methods of social physics.\nQuetelet in his analysis drew especially on ``the\nerror curve'' (the Gaussian normal distribution) to\nunderstand social regularities. Curiously, though, he\neschewed his own home discipline of astronomy to\nprovide other explanatory theories. But they came\nfrom that subject in 1858, although not from a trained\nastronomer, but oddly from a retired autodidact and\nPhiladelphia publisher, Henry Carey. Carey unabash-\nedly believed in monism, writing that ``the laws which\ngovern matter in all its forms, whether that of coal,\nclay, iron, pebble stones, trees, oxen, horses, or man\nwent further. His three-volume Principles of Social\nScience applied Newtonian gravity formulations to\nterrestrial human movement. Carey wrote that under\n``the great law of molecular gravitation . . . man tends\nof necessity to gravitate toward his fellow man\n[sic] . . . . Gravitation is here, as everywhere else in\nthe material world, in the direct ratio of the mass\nand in the inverse one of the distance'' (quoted in\nBut all of this was just a protracted warm-up for\nwhat was to come. Beginning from the early 1940s\nand continuing to the present, social physics bur-\ngeoned, drawing in research money, establishing insti-\ntutional bases, fostering specialized workshops and\nconferences, and launching its own journals as well as\nthousands of academic papers. The current form of the\nfield, also called sociophysics or statistical physics, is\ndominated by physicists (see, for example,\nciplinary'': applying principles and methods of physics\nto subject matter traditionally investigated by other\ndisciplines such as economics, psychology, sociology,\nBut the earlier mid-20th-century incarnation of\nsocial physics, and this paper's primary concern, was\ninterdisciplinary in a different sense. It was constituted\nby researchers from many different disciplines and\nwhich, from the early 1950s, included geographers,\nproducing an explicit spatial analysis.4\nMid-century social physics\nOnly one of the two founders of the mid-20th-century\nversion of social physics was a physicist, John Stewart,\nProfessor of Astrophysics at Princeton. The other was a\nlinguist, George Zipf, who taught in Harvard's German\nDepartment. From 1939, he was given a one-off pos-\nition of University Lecturer that allowed him free rein\nto teach in the College any subject he wanted: he chose\nsocial physics.\nGeorge K. Zipf\nZipf was fascinated, maybe obsessed, with numerical\npatterns. He was originally appointed at Harvard's\nDepartment of German. Strangely, though, his research\nwas not about that language but Chinese. It involved\ntaking 20 extracts of Chinese writing, each with at least\na thousand syllables, and generating in total 20,000\nCarrying out a large-scale numerical analysis, making\nuse of student ``human computers'' to undertake the\ncalculations, Zipf found that the frequency distribution\nof syllables conformed to the power law5\nPn\nwhere Pn\nis the frequency of any given Chinese syllable\nranked n (all syllables are ranked in order of their fre-\nquency of occurrence, with the most frequent ranked 1,\nBarnes and Wilson 3\nthe second most frequent 2, and so on down to rank n);\nand exponent a is almost equal to 1.\nThe power law finding perfectly catered to Zipf's\nobsession. It implied a set numerical pattern in which\nthe second most frequent Chinese syllable occurred\napproximately one-half as often as the first, the third\nsyllable one-third as often, and so on down the line.\nMoreover, Zipf found that the same power law distri-\nbution held in other languages too, and not only for\nsyllables but also for words and phrases (Zipf, 1932,\n1968). In each case, the frequency of use of an element\nof language was inversely proportional to the rank of\nits frequency. In English, for example, Zipf found by\nexamining texts as different as the King James Bible\nand James Joyce's Ulysses that ``the'' is the most fre-\nquently used word in the language, which is twice as\ncommon as the second most frequently used word,\n``of,'' and three times as common as the third most\nfrequently used word, ``and.''\nAfter Zipf was appointed as University Lecturer, he\ntook his original finding and in true social physics\nfashion applied it to other social phenomena. In this\nhe was guided by his faith in monism. As he put it in a\n1942 paper, ``the same natural law governs the structure\nand behavior of our planet, of life on our planet,\nand indeed, of even the smallest minutiae of living\nactivity including the most subtle emotional and\nintellectual elaborations of the human mind'' (Zipf,\nHis immediate work was on city-size distributions,\nand published as National Unity and Disunity (Zipf,\n1941). Resting on an enormous amount of data collec-\ntion and analysis, making use of even more human\ncomputers than for his studies of language, Zipf\nfound his power law formulation applied to city-size\ndistributions not only across different countries but\nalso over time as well. Further, when plotted on log\npaper the power law distribution of city-size distribu-\ntions took on a striking linear form, making the rela-\ntionship even more beguiling (Figure 1). It established\nthat within a given urban system the second largest city\nwas half the size of the largest city, the third largest city\n4 Big Data & Society\na third of the size of the largest city and so on. Under\nsuch conditions the total population of the entire urban\nsystem was given by\nX\nN\nPn\nX\nN\nwhere Pn\nis the population of the nth ranked city\n(n \u00bc 1 . . . N); and P1\nis the population of the largest city.\nZipf called the right-hand side of equation (2) the\nrank-size rule, which was later eponymously dubbed\nZipf's Law. For any given ranked city n, its population\nwas equal to\nBefore his premature death from cancer in 1950 at\nage 48, Zipf, through prodigious feats of data collection\nand calculation, tried to show in his magnum opus,\nHuman Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort\n(1949), that the power law he had found for word fre-\nquency and city-size distributions applied to all phe-\nnomena.6 He seemingly had no problem in showing\nthat it applied to countable things like populations of\ncities, words used in English language publications\nfrom Beowulf to T.S. Eliot, and the ``length of intervals\nbetween repetition'' in Mozart's Bassoon Concerto\nBut he also suggested that it applied even to more\ntricky phenomena that one might think would resist\nenumeration, such as ``the death wish,'' multiple per-\nsonalities, and ``erotic substitute action'' (it is best not\n270). In each case, the power law holds because, as he\nargued in his 1949 volume, that distribution is the\nmanifestation of the ultimate monist principle, lex par-\nsionae, the principle of least effort (Zipf, 1949: ch. 1).\nZipf (1949: 1) contended that all parts of nature, and\nconsequently all parts of society, beat the most efficient\npath to any given end, ``minimiz[ing] the total work that\n[is] . . . expended in solving both . . . immediate problems,\nand probable future problems [original emphases].''\nThat resolution always takes the form of the power\nlaw distribution; it is the statistical manifestation of\nthe Principle of Least Effort.\nZipf's ambition was overweening. He thought social\nphysics ``could be applied to everything . . . down to and\nincluding man's innermost dreams. The soul. . . offers a\nperfectly legitimate problem to science'' (Zipf, 1942:\n62). Those who resisted that end he termed ``verbal-\nists,'' who he thought should be excoriated, if not\nsuffer something even worse.7 Moreover, he believed\nhe was on a modern-day crusade: ``My dear John,''\nbattle of the second half of the twentieth century is on;\nyou and I are both in it up to our necks with no earthly\npossibility of retreat (and there is no desire). I propose to\nkeep the canons barking.''8 He did until the day he died.\nBut his death was a half-century too early. He would\nhave been in computational heaven had he lived to\nexperience a world of Big Data. A world in which vast\namounts of social data were available to be sifted,\narranged, and analyzed, made to show the power of\nthe power law distribution and lex parsimonae, and\nwith neither a verbalist nor a human computer in sight.\nOur suggestion is that Zipf's work in part prepared social\nscience, and geography in particular, for that very world.\nJohn Q. Stewart\nEven more important for the social physics movement\nthan Zipf, who was a loner, was John Quincy Stewart.\nHis work directly linked to geography, and he also had\non his side, at least for a time, some heavy-weight US\nEast Coast institutions and intellectuals including the\nInstitute of Advanced Study at Princeton directed by\nRobert Oppenheimer, and Warren Weaver at the\nRockefeller Foundation that funded his social physics\nhis Princeton base who energetically and systematically\nconstructed, maintained, and promoted social physics\nas a new stand-alone discipline. Continually on the\nlook-out for new resources and allies, never missing\nan opportunity for endorsement (for both his project\nand for himself), he strove to turn social physics into a\nnew social science.\nStewart was a Princeton man through and through.\nAll his degrees were from there, and two years after his\nPhD he was back as a Princeton professor. Initially\ninterested in matters extraterrestrial by mid-career his\nresearch focus became increasingly earthly. It centered\non weather and navigation and, important for the later\nstory, led to the publication of a widely circulated\nprimer used in the US Army Air Force, Coasts,\nWaves, and Weather for Navigators (Stewart, 1945).\nPart of that same terrestrial turn was his interest\nin models of population potential; that is, applying\nideas of gravitational potential to the geographical dis-\ntribution of population. There are different ways to\ninterpret population potential, but perhaps the most\ncommon is as a measure of the influence of a given\npopulation at one location (j) on another location (i)\nvi\n\u00bc Pj\n=Dij\nwhere vi\nis the population potential at location i, Pj\nis\nthe size of the population at j, and Dij\nis the distance\nbetween locations i and j.\nBarnes and Wilson 5\nEquation (4) says that the population influence of\nlocation j on location i is proportional to the size of\nthe population at j doing the influencing, and inversely\nproportional to the distance between the two locations.\nTrue to his roots, Stewart first applied this potential\nequation to the geographical distribution of the\n``Princeton family,'' that is, the 20,438 members listed\nin the 1940 edition of Princeton University's Alumni\nDirectory.9 Devoting his 1939 ``Christmas holiday to\nstatistical study,'' and drawing on the ``vigorous assist-\nance of Philip Wilkie . . . [for] some of the computa-\ntions,'' Stewart first measured the population\npotential of every state in relation to New Jersey,\nPrinceton's home state. From that he worked out the\nexpected number of Princeton alumni for every state,\nand compared that number to the actual count from the\nAlumni Directory. Stewart found that expected and\nactual numbers of alumni ``more or less'' lined up. It\nshowed him that potential models applied not only to\nobjects in the heavens but also to those down on earth\nwithin the social field, thus fulfilling the promise of\nmonism; that is, a social physics one-size-fits-all theory.\nStewart subsequently expanded his inquiries, calcu-\nlating total population potential for the US as a whole.\nFor any given location i, total population potential is\nequal to the sum of all the individual potentials created\nby populations found at every location j (j \u00bc 1, 2, . . . N)\nVi \u00bc\nX\nN\nPj=Dij \u00f05\u00de\nwhere Vi\nis the total population potential for location i.\nWith total population potentials known for all loca-\ntions i, an equipotential (isopleth) map can be con-\nstructed. Each line on the map connects all places\nwith the same population potential. Figure 2 shows\npopulation potential isolines calculated by Stewart for\nthe United States for 1940. Population potentials are\nespecially high in the North East (NE), indicating the\nconsiderable influence of the population on any given\nlocation within that region, but it falls off markedly for\nlocations in the West until it rises again on the Pacific\nCoast.\nDrawing equipotential maps took an immense\namount of computational effort. That's why Stewart\nhad to give up his Christmas holidays in 1939, shackled\nto log tables, slide rule, and Mr. Philip Wilkie. But by\nthe late 1940s help was on its way in the form of elec-\ntrical computation and cartographic production.\n6 Big Data & Society\nStewart enlisted into his project Thomas B. Bissett, a\nPrinceton senior undergraduate electrical engineer, and\ninventor of a nationally award-winning ``computing\ndevice.'' Taking second prize at the American\nInstitute of Electrical Engineers' meeting at Pittsburgh\nin April, 1949, Bissett's machine ``permit[ed] the rapid\ndrawing of contours of equipotential.'' As Stewart\ndescribed it, Bissett's was an analog machine that\n``applies Ohm's law . . . to the computation of potential\nof population (number of people divided by distance).\nThreads attached to the scriber controls a set of\nresistances as it moves.''10 Admittedly, Bissett's\nmachine wasn't of the same caliber as other contempor-\nary computers such as Jay Forrester's at MIT, the\n``WHIRLWIND'' (Hughes, 1998), or John von\nNeumann's at the Institute of Advanced Studies,\nPrinceton, the ``JOHNNIAC'' (Dyson, 2012), but it\nwas certainly more reliable and quicker than Stewart's\nformer standby of human computers.\nBy the summer of 1949, Stewart thought it was time\nfor both he and the world to lose the quotation marks\nthat usually accompanied the term ``social physics.'' He\napproached a key post-war science manager and well-\nknown scientist in his own right, Warren Weaver, head\nof the Division of Natural Sciences of the Rockefeller\nFoundation, for funding to develop social physics as a\nproper social science. Shannon and Weaver (1949) had\npublished that same year The Mathematical Theory of\nCommunication, which became a central text of the early\npost-war period, linking science, mathematics, comput-\ning machines and society and according to Edwards\nhuman social activity.'' Weaver wrote back to Stewart,\n``I am completely sympathetic with your approach.''\nStewart used the money to mount seven conferences,\nas well as to help form in 1951 a Social Physics\nCommittee of 40 strong, associated with the\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of\nScience (AAAS), which produced its own bevy of spe-\ncial sessions. Stewart also increasingly adopted the lan-\nguage of ``isomorphism'' to describe the relationship\nbetween natural and social sciences. In a paper he\ngave in Boston at an AAAS meeting in December\n1953 he suggested that ``isomorphism means reliable\nitem-to-item correspondence between two or more\nfields which superficially may seem altogether dissimi-\nlar. The fields are exhibited as more or less identical in\ntheir patterns of concepts.''12 Of course, this was\nanother version of monism, and justification both for\nmore computation, data compilation, and mathemat-\nization within the social sciences, and further explor-\nation of points at which concepts from physics\ncorresponded to items and relationships within the\nsocial world. In the December paper, Stewart was\nemboldened to assert isomorphisms between thermal,\nelectromagnetic, and chemical energy and, respectively,\nhuman meaning, feeling, and authority, as well as an\nisomorphism between mechanical work (kinetic, elastic,\nand gravitational energy) and decision-making.13\nBut it was all a bit too much for Weaver, who wrote\nTo search for isomorphisms between social phenomena\nand physical phenomena is indeed an interesting idea.\nThe real question, however, is whether or not it is a\nrewarding idea. It is interesting to suppose that there\nmay be entities, social values, which play in social\nexperience the same roles played by different forms of\nphysical energy . . . But it is hard for me to sense how\none can usefully assign quantitative measures to any\nsignificantly wide range of ``values'' in the social field.\nAnd when you link together such things as meaning,\nfeeling, authority, and decision-making, this sounds to\nme like a very heterogeneous mixture.14\nStewart bristled at Weaver's use of ``interesting.'' It ``is\nmore than merely `interesting,''' Stewart wrote back.\nHe was also ``surprised'' that it ``sounds to you `like a\nvery heterogeneous mixture.'''15 The argument here\nwas around whether all social variables could, to use\nWeaver's terms, be assigned ``quantitative measures.''\nWeaver was sceptical, but Stewart bullish, in part\nbecause of his faith in monism. Clearly, this same\nissue continues into present discussions of Big Data,\nwhich seem to have sided with Stewart rather than\nWeaver.16 But on that occasion, Weaver held sway\nbecause he controlled the purse strings. He told\nStewart that his Rockefeller funding would not be\nrenewed. Stewart needed more allies. And that's what\nhe got later that same year, 1953, when William Warntz\ncontacted him.\nMacrogeography and William Warntz\nThe first communication between Stewart and Warntz\nwas about the Bissett. Warntz wrote to Stewart on\n1 October 1953, to ask whether the ``ingenious electrical\ncomputer designed and constructed by Thomas B.\nBissett . . . could be made available to him?''17 Warntz\nwas writing his PhD thesis at the University of\nPennsylvania using Stewart's population potential\nmodel, trying to calculate equipotential lines. He\nneeded that machine. But unfortunately it was not on\nhand. ``No Bissett available here'' replied Stewart,\nadding with a mathematician's zeal, ``longhand compu-\ntation is not so bad.''18 Possibly not, though. Warntz's\nthat in completing his doctoral dissertation alone\nWarntz undertook ``thousands of calculations to\nBarnes and Wilson 7\nderive population potential fields, all with a mechanical\nadding machine.''\nAlthough their first correspondence wasn't until\n1953, Warntz had been a secret admirer of Stewart\nfor some time. Warntz began his undergraduate\ndegree at Penn in economics in 1940. But the war inter-\nrupted his studies. In 1943, he enlisted in the US Army\nAir Force, and trained as a navigator. In active service\nfrom 1944, awarded several military medals, Warntz\nserved in a combat heavy bombardment group based\nin East Anglia. Following a crash landing as Warntz\nreturned from a mission, he was sent to Cambridge to\nrecuperate. It was there, presciently given his subse-\nquent involvement with Stewart and social physics,\nthat he read Isaac Newton's papers at the university\nlibrary, the site of the largest single deposit of such\npapers in the world. After the war ended, Warntz\nremained in the Army Air Force and was posted to\nGander at the Newfoundland Base Command for sea\nsearch and rescue missions. In the base's small library\nhe found J.Q. Stewart's Coasts, Waves and Weather for\nNavigators (1945), which was to change his life. The\nbook was primarily a how-to manual for navigators.\nBut in an appendix, and quite out of character with\nthe rest of the book (Warntz, 1984, 1, called it ``an\nexotic chapter''; 1984: 1), Stewart ``could not resist\nthe temptation'' to write about his new interest in popu-\nlation potential, likening equipotential lines to isobars\nwithin a cyclonic system. Warntz later said that was his\nence and the things I learned about meteorology and\nnavigation'' came together.19\nOnce Warntz demobbed in 1948, he quickly com-\npleted his Bachelor's degree in economics at Penn, did\nalso a Master's degree there, and in 1951 entered its\ndoctoral economics program, specializing in economic\ngeography. He was supervised by Lester Klimm, an\neconomist with an unlikely interest in location theory.\nHis dissertation, later published as Toward a Geography\nof Price (Warntz, 1959a), deployed the potential model\nto present a geographical analysis of price, empirically\nillustrated using commodity statistics taken from the\nUS Department of Agriculture. The thesis involved\nthe construction of both an aggregate demand curve\nderived from population potential estimates weighted\nby income, and an aggregate supply curve obtained\nfrom potential estimates of spatially varying produc-\ntion levels of different agricultural commodities. The\nintersection of the two curves determined the geog-\nraphy of price.\nAfter the initial contact about the Bissett in October\n1953, Stewart invited Warntz to come to the Princeton\nrest is history, with Warntz becoming Stewart's staunch-\nest ally. The timing could not have been better given\nWeaver's rejection of Stewart's project earlier that\nsame year. It meant social physics got a second chance\nwith a new home, in a discipline with a well-established\nprovenance that came with a formidable institutional\nstructure that included both the American\nGeographical Society (AGS) (where from 1956\nWarntz was a Research Associate running his own ``spe-\ncial program'' in social physics) and the Association of\nAmerican Geographers (AAG), which brought a large\nprospective audience, so far untouched by social physics\nbut potentially ready to be converted.\nBut for this to happen in geography, things needed\nto be shaken up. In an address to the Geography ses-\nsion at the annual meeting of the National Council for\nSocial Studies in Pittsburgh, in November 1957,\nWarntz said:\nIn our researches in geography and our contributions\nto the journals of learned societies, I suggest the time\nhas come for some unruliness, for discomfiting the\nfeeble-minded, for treading upon the weak, and for\ngeneral impatience. The time has come to raise a\nrumpus in geography.20\nWarntz argued in that address that geography was get-\nting no respect either from ``the Ivies'' \u00ad Ivy League\nuniversities like Harvard, which had shut down its\ngeography program nine years before \u00ad or from geog-\nraphers themselves who since the interwar period had\npursued a parochial and prosaic version of their disci-\npline, concerned only with ``the immediate, the obvi-\nous, the microscopic, and the demonstrably\nutilitarian.'' For Warntz, the discipline could be so\nmuch more. But to do that, geographers needed to\nthink big, to practice ``macrogeography.'' He thought\nmacrogeography would attract ``the Ivies'' and bring\nback to the discipline ``originality,'' ``erudition,'' and\n``brilliant scholarship.''21\nPredictably Warntz's conception of macrogeography\nwas uncompromisingly monistic. Warntz was fond of\nrepeating his own choice phrases, and there was no\nphrase he repeated more often than ``social sci-\nence . . . and physical science are but mutually related\nisomorphic examples of one generalized logic''\nmacrogeography; it embodied the ``one generalized\nlogic.'' That logic was of a single discipline: physics.\nIt meant geography becoming like physics. And if a\ndiscipline failed to do so, as geography patently had,\nthen it would suffer; it had suffered. That's why a\n``rumpus'' was necessary.\nWarntz thought geography had gone wrong when it\nturned to what he called microgeography, which was\n``preoccupied with the unique, the exceptional . . . and\n8 Big Data & Society\nZipf's dreaded verbalism, ``subjective description,''\nsuch as ``a feeling for the area,'' ``the personality of\nthe region,'' and ``man-land relationship'' (Warntz,\nsaid microgeography ``has been tried, found wanting,\nand is justifiably being discarded.''22\nNow was the time to make amends, to do macro-\ngeography \u00ad a geography unified with the ``one general-\nized logic.''23 Although Warntz coined the specialized\nterm macrogeography for his approach, it was nothing\nother than social physics. The name macrogeography\nserved only a rhetorical function of making the project\npalatable to geographers, adding nothing substantively\nthat wasn't already contained within Stewart's original\nformulation. But the name did resonate with, and in\npart was picked up by, other practitioners of spatial\nanalysis who also emerged in the mid-to-late 1950s\nboth inside and outside geography. Walter Isard's\nRegional Science Department was founded at Penn\nthe same year Warntz finished his PhD therein 1955.\nSocial physics was incorporated at least into Isard\net al.'s (1960) tome on regional science methods, and\nWarntz maintained an adjunct position in regional sci-\nence at Penn until 1966. Likewise there were various\nlinkages between Warntz and the work of proponents\nof geography's ``quantitative revolution'' that occurred\naround the same time. Particularly important were the\nso-called ``Garrison Raiders,'' a group of graduate stu-\ndents at the Department of Geography, University of\nWashington, Seattle, who worked with a young faculty\nmember, Bill Garrison, who shared Warntz's dissatis-\nfaction with ``microgeography'' and who sought an\nalternative in some form of spatial analysis.\nCore to Warntz's spatial version of social physics\nwas the computational task of confronting big data.\nIn this he was fortunate, given that he and his macro-\ngeography came of age during a period marked both\nby the rapidly improving power of machine-based\ncomputation as well as by increasing access to those\nmachines. There would be no more cap-in-hand beg-\nging for the Bissett. In a paper, in the Geographical\ndevelopment of macrogeography to computer develop-\nment. The issue turned on the number of so-called\n``control points'' used to calculate a given population\npotential map. A control point was a designated map\nlocation associated with a particular population level.\nKnowing those locations and population numbers was\nnecessary before any potential calculations could be\nmade and equipotential lines drawn. But the more\ncontrol points, and clear from equation (5), the\nmore gruelling the resulting calculations. In Stewart's\nfirst 1940 set of population potential calculations there\nwere just 24 control points. Calculating for even that\nrelatively small number by hand, even with the\nassistance of the energetic Mr. Wilkie, still took\nStewart all the Christmas holidays. Later Stewart\nused Thomas Bissett's machine, but it could only\n177). The breakthrough was the arrival of the digital\ncomputer. In 1958, Warntz and Stewart used ``an\nearly IBM electronic computer . . . [to] compute . . . a\nWarntz was calculating the US population potential\nusing 3105 control points (one for every county in\nthe conterminous United States). Warntz (1964:\nInputs came from 3,105 punched cards . . . and [each\ncard] contained for each county . . . the 1960 popula-\ntion, area, and geographical co-ordinates of the\ncounty's population center . . . [A]bout ten billion arith-\nmetic operations were required to produce th[e] map,\nand three other, different maps computed at the same\ntime. About twenty-three thousand words of stor-\nage (thirty-six bit words) were required, and the program-\nming language used was Fortan . . . Running time for the\ncomputer was a few seconds short of two hours.\nWarntz also used the same computer for his 200 hour-\nlong, spare-time project of constructing a three-\nUS population potential map. It was for an AGS exhi-\nbit, ``New York: An International City,'' at the 1964\u00ad\nWarntz had hammered into the base map 3105 individ-\nual nails, the exact height of each calculated by the IBM\nWarntz's work impressed Howard Fisher, who in\n1965 had founded the Laboratory for Computer\nGraphics within the Harvard Graduate School of\nDesign (GSD), with the intellectual support of Brian\nBerry of the University of Chicago and Waldo Tobler\nof the University of Michigan (both geographers and\nmembers of Bill Garrison's ``Raiders''). Fisher had\norganized a series of luncheon presentations on the\nstate-of-the-art in the spatial representation of quanti-\ntative information, to include Berry and Warntz.24 In\n1966, Warntz was made Professor of Theoretical\nGeography and Regional Planning (although without\ntenure) within the lab (the first professor of geography\non Harvard's campus since Derwent Wittlesey's death\nwithin the lab was two-fold, according to Warntz:\nfirst, the ``continued investigation into the uses of graph-\nical analysis, and computer graphics in particular,''\nof which Fisher no doubt led the effort, and, second,\n``pure research in the framework of general systems\ntheory and spatial patterns,''25 much of which was also\nBarnes and Wilson 9\nlumped by Warntz as theoretical geography and pub-\nlished within the Harvard Papers in Theoretical\nAs Fisher was due to retire in 1970, at the exhaustion\nof the Ford Foundation grant that supported the lab,\nWarntz became Director in 1968 and the name of the\nlab became the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and\nSpatial Analysis. In addition to his duties within the\nGraduate School of Design, Warntz also led freshmen\nseminars within Harvard and was even asked to submit\na proposal justifying the return of geography to the\ngraphy really was what the Ivies wanted, with\nWarntz's work representing qualities of ``originality,''\n``erudition,'' and ``brilliant scholarship.'' In the end it\ndidn't work out, with geography never returning to\nHarvard after all, and Warntz resigning his position\nthree years after he became Director (see Chrisman,\n2006, for an excellent history of the Harvard lab and\nWarntz's role within it). What Warntz did achieve,\nhowever, was to prepare the ground of geography for\nBig Data, providing models of spatial analysis, stressing\nthe importance of powerful computing machines, and\nchampioning the belief that sooner or later the entire\nsocial field could be turned into numbers.\nConclusion\nThe strategic positions of graphics and geometry\nbecome even more clearly defined, while concomitantly\nthe distinction between cartography and spatial\nThe engine that drives social physics is big data: the\nnewly ubiquitous digital data that is becoming available\nabout all aspects of human life. By using these data to\nbuild a predictive, computational theory of human\nbehavior, we can hope to engineer better social systems.\nWarntz's belief that numeracy held the key to spatial\nproblem-solving was yoked to his curiosity about spatial\nrepresentation as a means both to test hypotheses and to\nrealize solutions graphically. That ``we now look upon\nmaps not only as stores for spatially ordered informa-\ntion'' but also as part of a three-segmented theoretical\ngeography of description, classification, and prediction,\ncomplemented the efforts of the lab under Fisher, an\narchitect interested in assessing how computer graphics\nwould alter the conventions of thematic cartography. 26\nAnd this predilection can be felt as the impulse of Big\nData, as can be seen in the materials for the new social\nphysics at the MIT Media Lab, ``to build a predictive,\ncomputational theory of human behavior.'' While at\nHarvard, Warntz worked alongside many of the leading\nfigures of what would become Geographic Information\nScience, including Jack Dangermond (founder of Esri,\nthe company responsible for ArcGIS), and when he\nresigned his position at the GSD in 1971 he was\nappointed at the University of Western Ontario, where\nBill Bunge (another Garrison Raider and author of\nTheoretical Geography) was serving as visiting professor\nand where Mike Goodchild was beginning his academic\ncareer in spatial analysis (and would later occupy the\nDangermond Chair of Geography at UC-Santa\nBig Data continues to vex GIScience, as can be seen\nin the precipitous rise of volunteered geographic infor-\n220), ``the most important value of VGI may lie in\nwhat it can tell about local activities in various geo-\ngraphic locations that go unnoticed by the world's\nmedia, and about life at a local level.'' The spatial ana-\nlysis of these data inherits the affect, if not many of the\ntechniques, associated with social physics. As Anselin\nwith current spatial analysis and their subfield of spatial\neconometrics ``has roots in regional economics and\nquantitative geography.'' Interestingly, this form of\nmacrogeography \u00ad to understand the spatial patterning\nof Big Data \u00ad does not preclude attention to the micro\n(in fact, it presupposes recording the rich details of pri-\nvate life). Likely, Warntz would be pleased. While, per-\nhaps, there are other epistemologies that enroll Big\nData beyond the monism of data-driven methods (for\ninstance, Crampton et al., 2013), our curiosity is\nincreasingly piqued by the continuities of macrogeogra-\nphy with some contemporary GIScience work, made\nmore conspicuous, we suggest, by the rise of Big Data.\nOur suggestion is that we've been here before. That\nthe call to quantify and to represent social-spatial activ-\nity enacts a specific visibility that potentially renders\ninvisible other phenomena. Not everything can be\nquantified, or only partially quantified. What's not\ndrops out of view. That was precisely the issue when\ncritics in human geography took aim at Warntz's social\nphysics version of the discipline during the 1970s. So-\ncalled humanistic geographers argued that what\nbecame invisible in Warntz's social physics was any\nreal, sentient human being, who could never be\ndescribed by numbers alone (Ley and Samuels, 1978).\nRadical geographers such as Harvey (1972) thought\nwhat dropped out were social relationships, power\ninequalities, and class conflict \u00ad for them, vital to\nunderstanding any kind of geography, large or small.\nWhile these criticisms led to new forms of geography\nemerging, the social physics kind continued, indeed\nflourished, finding new applications and academic\nhomes, taking on new manifestations, one of which\n10 Big Data & Society\nwe've argued was Big Data. That's the reason we need\nto trace the connective tissues between Big Data and\nthe mid-20th century. Not to do so would be a mistake.\nBy showing that Big Data is historical, we show the\nassumptions that were built into it, as well as the con-\ntestations around them. Big Data becomes no longer a\nblack box, self-contained, sealed and impregnable, but\nis opened up, available for verbalist discussion and\ncontestation.\nIn 1967, Warntz provided a summary of the lab's\nposition with respect to the mathematization of\ngeography:\nDescription of surfaces and paths including geodesics,\nspatial probabilities, central-place hierarchies in the\nbroadest sense are the types that seem destined to\nreplace the current arrangement characterized by spe-\ncialties classified in terms of non-spatial properties and\nincluding such things as population geography, linguis-\ntic geography, cultural geography, economic geog-\nraphy, and so on. We agree.29\nWhat Warntz is trying to do here is monism: to say that\nthere is only one version of geography, the social phys-\nics kind, and all other kinds of geography are mistakes\nthat must be abandoned. That same monistic urge,\nwe've suggested, is also found in Big Data. We disagree.\nBut as verbalists, we would.\n"
