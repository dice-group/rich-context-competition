Occupational exposure\nis a known risk factor for COPD. Industry-based epidemio-\nlogic studies have shown that occupational exposure to inor-\nganic and organic dusts and to chemical agents can increase\nthe risk of COPD (2\u00ad4). In addition, general population-\nbased studies have identified associations between COPD\nand employment in industrial and job categories or specific\noccupational exposures (5\u00ad16). However, to our knowledge,\nthe contribution of occupational exposure to COPD\nmorbidity in the general US population has not yet been\nquantified. The population-based Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (17, 18)\nenables estimation of the population prevalence and preva-\nlence odds ratios for COPD and employment by industry as\nwell as evaluation of the magnitude of the effect of occupa-\ntional exposure on COPD in the US population (19).\nThe objective of the present study was to analyze the\nNHANES III survey data to estimate the prevalence, preva-\nlence odds ratios, and attributable fractions for COPD and\nemployment by specific industry sectors (industry) and\noccupational categories (occupation). The aim was to esti-\nmate the magnitude of the effect of occupational exposure on\nCOPD in the US population and to identify industries and\nCorrespondence to Dr. Eva Hnizdo, Division of Respiratory Disease Studies, MS H2800, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,\nAssociation between COPD and Employment 739\noccupations at increased risk of COPD that can be targeted\nfor etiologic studies or disease prevention programs.\nStudy subjects\nThe NHANES III survey was conducted from 1988 to\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyatts-\nville, Maryland, to assess the health and nutritional status of\nthe US population. A multistage, stratified probability\nsampling design was used to select a representative sample\nAmericans, Mexican Americans, and persons aged 60 years\nor older were oversampled. Eighty-one counties in the\nUnited States were sampled; in each county and selected\nhousehold, the probability of a person being chosen was\nbased on sex, age, and race/ethnicity. The resulting total\npercent were Caucasian, 27.4 percent were African Amer-\nican, and 26.5 percent were Mexican American. The survey\nincluded a questionnaire, a laboratory examination, and lung\nfunction testing.\nThe present study included subjects aged 30\u00ad75 years (n =\n11,447). These age cutoff points were chosen under the\nassumption that COPD due to occupational exposure would\nnot generally be observed before midlife (20). In addition,\nmany subjects less than age 30 years are still reaching their full\nlung function potential (21), and many older subjects develop\nage-related medical conditions that can affect lung function.\nFurthermore, we excluded 1,009 subjects because of lung\nfunction testing problems (missing tests (n = 826), unreliable\nflow volume curves (n = 97), or only one reliable maneuver\n(n = 86)), 506 subjects with physician-diagnosed current\nasthma, and 109 subjects for whom occupational codes were\nmissing, leaving 9,823 subjects for the data analysis.\nDefinition of COPD\nThe definition of COPD was based on Global Initiative for\nChronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) working group\ncriteria (20) of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\n)/\nforced vital capacity (FVC) less than 70 percent and FEV1\nless than 80 percent predicted. The FEV1\npercent predicted\nvalues were calculated by using sex-specific reference equa-\ntions for Caucasians, African Americans, and Mexican\nAmericans, estimated from tests of asymptomatic\nnonsmokers in the NHANES III study (21). Lung function\ntesting methods for the NHANES III study conformed to the\n1987 American Thoracic Society acceptability and repro-\nducibility criteria (22).\nCigarette smoking\nThe NHANES III survey included questions on current\nsmoking status, number of cigarettes smoked, and age at\nwhich smoking started and stopped. Two smoking variables\nwere created: smoking status and pack-years. For smoking\nstatus, subjects were categorized as never smokers, former\nsmokers, or current smokers. Pack-years were estimated by\nmultiplying the current number of packs of cigarettes\nsmoked (or, for former smokers, the number of packs\nsmoked when they last smoked) by the number of years of\nsmoking. Never smokers were defined as those who smoked\nfewer than 100 cigarettes during their entire life.\nOccupational coding\nOccupational coding was based on two items on the\nNHANES III Adult Survey Questionnaire. That is, study\nsubjects were asked to identify 1) the type of work they\nperformed for the longest period of time (occupation) and 2)\nfor this occupation, the type of business or industry they\nworked in the longest (industry). In the NHANES III data\nset, occupation was coded according to the 1990 Occupa-\ntional Classification System used in the 1990 US Census\nOccupational Classification codes published by the US\nDepartment of Commerce (24). Industry was coded\naccording to the 1990 Industrial Classification System used\nin the 1990 US Census, a modification of the Standard\nIndustrial Classification codes (25). These detailed industry\nand occupation codes are collapsed in the NHANES III\npublic use data set.\nIndustry categories used in the analysis\nThe NHANES III data set contains 44 industry and 40\noccupation codes that include workers with a varied poten-\ntial for exposure to respiratory hazards. A priori, we grouped\nindustries in which workers had a similar potential for expo-\nsure to respiratory hazards believed to cause COPD as\nfollows. We kept the original industry categories, but\nsubjects with office work occupations were excluded from\nthe industrial sectors. Office workers from all industry\nsectors were combined into a single category that was used\nas a comparison group. This \"office workers\" category\nincluded managers, secretaries and typists, clerks, and\nadministrative workers as well as teachers, writers and\nartists, professionals, and workers from such nonmanufac-\nturing sectors as banking, insurance, communications,\neducation, social service, and public administration. We\nmoved laborers, cleaners, material handlers, and mainte-\nnance workers from the banking, insurance, communica-\ntions, education, social service, and public administration\nsectors into a new industry category called \"office building\nservices.\" Similarly, we moved construction, horticultural,\nmedical, food preparation, and transportation workers from\nthe nonmanufacturing sectors to the appropriate industry\ncategory with a similar potential for exposure to respiratory\nhazards.\nThis recoding resulted in 26 industry categories. For the\nfinal analysis, we combined categories in which odds ratios\nfor COPD were not increased into one category of \"other\nindustries,\" which resulted in 16 final categories for the\noverall analysis.\nOccupation categories used in the analysis\nThe NHANES III data set includes 40 occupation codes\ncombined across all industries. A priori, we collapsed them\ninto 25 occupational categories believed to have a similar\npotential for exposure to respiratory hazards and sufficient\nnumbers for analysis. For the final analysis, occupational\ncategories for which there was no evidence of an increased\nrisk of COPD were combined in an \"other occupations\" cate-\ngory, resulting in 14 final categories.\nStatistical data analysis\nWe used the SUDAAN software program (26) to estimate\nthe weighted population size, prevalence, and prevalence\nodds ratios for COPD by industry and occupation. This soft-\nware adjusts for the sampling design in calculating the vari-\nance estimates (27) and uses individual sampling weights\nassigned by the National Center for Health Statistics to\nadjust for the number of persons in the population that each\nsampled person represents. The weighted estimates are unbi-\nased estimators of the US population parameters (19).\nThe SUDAAN logistic program was used to estimate odds\nratios for COPD and industry/occupation adjusted for the\neffect of age, sex, race/ethnic group, body mass index,\nsmoking status, pack-years of cigarette smoking, education,\nand socioeconomic status (20). Socioeconomic status was\nadjusted by using the poverty income index, computed as the\nratio of the family income and the poverty threshold value\nspecific to the family size. Industry (or occupation) was\nincluded in the models as a set of 0 or 1 dummy variables\nrepresenting each industry (or occupation). Because of large\nnumbers and a low prevalence of COPD, office workers\nwere used as the baseline category against which other occu-\npational groups were compared. Preliminary analyses\nrevealed differences between sexes and among race/ethnic\ngroups in the size of the adjusted odds ratios; therefore, we\nalso conducted sex- and race/ethnic-specific analyses for\nCOPD to better identify subgroups at risk of COPD.\nIn an unweighted analysis, we examined trends in adjusted\nodds ratios for COPD and increasing duration of employ-\nment in the longest-held occupation (ascertained by asking\nthe following question: Considering all your employers, for\nhow long did you do this kind of work?). For that purpose,\noccupations were grouped, according to the size of the esti-\nmated odds ratio for COPD, into high- and low-risk groups.\nIn these groups, the trend with duration of employment (0,\n1\u00ad14, 15 years) was estimated by using office workers as\nthe \"unexposed\" comparison group.\nThe population attributable fraction (AFP\n; i.e., the fraction\nof cases with COPD due to industrial exposure) was calcu-\nlated according to the following formula (28\u00ad30):\n(ORi\nwhere k = number of industry sectors; pci\n= casesi\n/total cases,\nwhere casesi\nrepresents the estimated number of COPD cases\nin the ith industry and total cases represents the total number\nof cases summed across industry sectors; and ORi\n= the\nadjusted odds ratio for COPD estimated for the ith industry.\nRESULTS\nfunction tests were valid, 693 (7.1 percent) were identified as\nhaving COPD. To assess disease severity, we compared\nmean percent predicted FEV1\n, mean percent predicted FVC,\n/FVC ratio for subjects without COPD, with\nCOPD, and with physician-diagnosed emphysema or\nchronic bronchitis reported on the NHANES III question-\nnaire (table 1). In table 1, subjects with COPD defined epide-\nmiologically had lower mean lung function values than those\nwith physician-diagnosed emphysema or those with chronic\nbronchitis.\nTable 2 shows the distribution of all study subjects and\nnever smokers according to nonoccupational risk factors for\nCOPD that were adjusted for in the logistic regression. Table\n2 also shows the population prevalence of COPD according\nto these factors.\nCOPD by industrial sectors\nThe overall analysis identified 14 industries with increased\nadjusted odds ratios for COPD.

The overall cost for occupational COPD was estimated\nin the US working population aged 30\u00ad75 years is attribut-\nable to occupational exposure. For never smokers, the attrib-\nutable fraction was estimated as 31 percent (approximate 95\nThe present study generated hypotheses aimed at 1) iden-\ntifying industries associated with an increased risk of COPD\nthat might be targeted for further research and 2) estimating\nthe attributable fraction for occupational COPD. The esti-\nmated attributable fraction of 19 percent was based on\nincreased odds ratios for COPD in 14 industries listed in\ntable 3. Additional supporting evidence for an increased risk\nof COPD in these industries came from increased odds ratios\nfor never smokers, for sex- and race/ethnic-specific sub-\ngroups, and by occupational categories. In preliminary anal-\nyses in which a less stringent cutoff point of 75 percent was\nused for the FEV1\n/FVC ratio, we observed a higher degree of\nconsistency among the three major race/ethnic groups for the\nadjusted odds ratios for industries and occupations. Use of\nGlobal Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease\ncriteria resulted in a reduced number of COPD cases and\nwider confidence intervals but also in decreased odds ratios\nfor African Americans and, to a lesser degree, Mexican\nAmericans. This result may be related to higher age-related\n/FVC values observed for the two race/ethnic\ngroups in the NHANES III study (21).\nAn increased risk of COPD has been reported for many of\nthe associations observed in the present study. Several\ngeneral population-based studies reported associations with\nspecific occupational exposures. A study conducted in\nTucson, Arizona, found an association between airflow\nobstruction and self-reported exposure to silica, fiberglass,\nsawdust, Freon (E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Wilm-\nington, Delaware), automobile exhaust, solvents, and\nconstruction work (5). The US Six-City study found associ-\nations of chronic respiratory symptoms and COPD with\nworking with dusts, fumes, and gases (6).\nIn addition, studies in Norway found significant associa-\ntions between airflow obstruction and occupational exposure\nto quartz (11\u00ad13), ammonia, nitrous gas, sulfur dioxide gas,\nmetal fumes, and anhydrides (13). A study of New Zealand\nsubjects aged 20\u00ad44 years found associations between\nairflow obstruction (FEV1\n/FVC <75 percent) and working as\ncleaners, bakers, spray painters, laboratory technicians, and\nplastics and rubber workers and in construction and mining.\nIn addition, shortness of breath was reported more frequently\nby hairdressers and chemical processors. Chronic bronchitis\nwas reported more often in food processors, chemical\nAssociation between COPD and Employment 745\nprocessors, and spray painters and in construction and\nmining. In a large international study of subjects aged 20\u00ad44\nyears, self-reported occupational exposure to vapors, gas,\ndust, or fumes was associated with chronic bronchitis in agri-\ncultural, textile, paper, wood, chemical, and food processing\nworkers (15). In the Netherlands, the Zutphen study found an\nincreased risk of nonspecific lung disease for textile workers\nand tailors (relative risk (RR) = 2.4), construction and\ncement workers (RR = 2.3), transportation workers (RR =\n2.1), furnace workers (RR = 2.1), wood and paper workers\nstudies of COPD have found an increased risk in textile mills\n(34), the rubber industry (35), mining, construction, chem-\nical production, food products manufacturing, and agricul-\nThe US Work-Related Lung Disease Surveillance Report\nlists industries associated with significantly elevated propor-\ntional mortality ratios for COPD (40). In support of our find-\nings, the proportional mortality ratios for taxicab services,\ntrucking services, automotive and miscellaneous repair\nservices, construction, gasoline service stations, and the\nmilitary were among the highest. On the other hand, mining\nand potteries, which had the highest proportional mortality\nratios listed in the Work-Related Lung Disease Surveillance\nReport, were not identified by the present study primarily\nbecause of limitations described in the paragraph that\nfollows.\nTo our knowledge, previous epidemiologic studies have\nnot reported an increased risk of COPD for industries such as\nutilities, the armed forces, office building services, sales, and\nhealth care and for occupations such as records processing\nclerks as well as freight, stock, and material handlers. (The\nrecords processing clerks category includes mail handlers.)\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\nconducted several Health Hazard Evaluations in mail\nprocessing and distribution plants in response to workers'\ncomplaints of work-related upper and lower respiratory\nsymptoms and asthma (41). In addition, an epidemiologic\nstudy found decrements in lung function associated with\nmore than 10 years of high exposure to paper dust (42).\nThe strengths of the present study include reliable lung\nfunction data, a large sample size that allowed for unbiased\nestimation of the effect of the confounding factors, and\nvaried industrial and job exposures. Application of the\nsampling weights resulted in odds ratios that were similar to\nthose obtained from unweighted analyses. The limitations of\nthe study are mainly due to the study design and include the\nfollowing: 1) the NHANES III survey was not designed to be\nrepresentative of US employment patterns, thus potentially\nobscuring the importance of some high-risk work; 2)\nindustry and occupation categories were not always homog-\nenous with respect to exposure to respiratory hazards; 3) lack\nof detailed industry/occupation codes undoubtedly resulted\nin some misclassification of exposure; and 4) the cross-\nsectional study design has limitations for the ascertainment\nof correct causal exposure.\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study show that\nemployment in specific industries and occupations is associ-\nated with an increased risk of developing COPD, and they\nadd further evidence that occupational exposures contribute\nsignificantly to the overall burden of COPD. Part of this\nburden may be due to the synergistic effect of tobacco\nsmoking and occupational exposure (43). More research is\nneeded to confirm that the newly identified industries and\noccupations are associated with an increased risk of COPD\nand to identify causal risk factors. To maximize the impact\nof this research on reducing the prevalence of COPD in the\nUS population, etiologic research and preventive interven-\ntions should focus on industries that have high odds ratios\nand a large number of cases attributable to workplace\nexposure.\nREFERENCES\n1.
