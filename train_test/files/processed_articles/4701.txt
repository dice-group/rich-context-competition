It involves pass-\ning on logistics-related activities in part or whole to an exter-\nnal party to execute. Organizations are increasingly practicing\nit with notable benefits: reduction in operations cost, improve-\nment in flexibility and operationalization of logistics services,\nreduction in capital investment, and so on (Rahman, 2011;\ngest that companies have recourse to 3PL to reduce the load of\nlogistics processes and achieve customer satisfaction and\ncompetitive advantage (Chen, Goan, & Huang, 2011).\nThere is increasing global acceptance of the use of 3PL\n(Sohal, Millen, & Moss, 2002; Zhu, Ng, Wang, & Zhao,\n2017), indicating more growth opportunities for 3PL usage\nby international organizations. Logistics services constitute a\ncritical aspect of the operations and supply processes in the\noil & gas business (O&G). O&G operations involve cross-\nborder transactions; exploration and drilling equipment are\nfrequently moved around locations; O&G personnel travel\nround local and international asset locations and research and\ndevelopment centers; and oil products are also transported\ninternationally, involving long-term global supply agree-\nments (Guajardo, Kylinger, & Ronnqvist, 2013; Shyshou,\nGribkovskaia, Laporte, & Fagerholt, 2012).\nThe O&G faces challenges in providing fit-for-purpose\nin-house logistics solutions: unfavorable local conditions\nfor the IOCs (International Oil Companies), in-house capac-\nity to deliver specialized logistics solutions, and resource\ninefficiencies arising from in-house resources that could\nbetter be harnessed for O&G's core activities. Logistics is\nnot regarded as a core activity within the O&G as it is not\none of its exploration, production, and refining operations\nwhich focus more on mechanical matrices. O&G requires an\nexternal agent to provide the human element which is an\nimportant factor in logistics service delivery, unbundle\nlogistics burden from the O&G routines, leverage assets for\neconomies of scale and scope, and provide professional\nlogistics services to the oil industry. In this context, Zhu\net al. (2017) acknowledge that logistics outsourcing are\nbeing increasingly adopted by firms to \"reduce costs and\nincrease flexibility\" (p. 29).\n1BMV Energy Logistics Ltd., Port Harcourt, Nigeria\n2University of Liverpool, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n3University of Mauritius, Moka, Mauritius\nCorresponding Author:\nEmah Patrick Etokudoh, BMV Energy Logistics Ltd., 278 PH-Aba\nExpressway, Rumukrushi Junction, Port Harcourt, 500211, Nigeria.\nEmail: emaetokudo@gmail.com\nThird Party Logistics Outsourcing:\nAn Exploratory Study of the Oil and Gas\nIndustry in Nigeria\nEmah Patrick Etokudoh1, Mehraz Boolaky2,\nand Mridula Gungaphul3\n Keywords\ninternational management, transportation, industry sector management, service management, third party logistics, outsourcing\n2 SAGE Open\nCountry-Specific Logistics Challenges for IOCs\nCertain region-specific needs exist that create local challenges\nfor 3PL delivery. The United States and Europe focus more on\nintegrated 3PL services and cost reduction, and Mexico on cus-\ntomer services and core competencies (Arroyo, Gaytan, & De\nBoer, 2006). Oil producing countries rank low in logistics per-\nformance with their peculiar challenges (Hilmola, 2011).\nNigeria, an oil producing country, with over 5% logistics infra-\nstructural failure per annum has National Transport Policy that\nsuffers ineffective implementation with corresponding impact\nin cost of logistics operations (Ugboaja, 2010). It seems then\nthat it would make economic sense for the IOCs to shift toward\n3PL outsourcing in Nigeria. This, however, assumes that ven-\ndor capability is guaranteed, and that employees' reaction to\n3PL would not lead to logistics outsourcing failure.\nGaps in the Literature\nGaps exist in literature on the benefits and challenges of 3PL\nservices in Nigeria in general and particularly in the oil indus-\ntry. Much has been reported about 3PL in the developed econ-\nSohal et al., 2002), but mostly on services and manufacturing\nindustries. Interestingly, there are cases of sector-driven logis-\ntics solutions and country-specific needs (Carneiro, Ribas, &\nHamcher, 2010; Holguin-Veras, Jaller, Van Wassenhove,\nPerez, & Wachtendorf, 2012).Also, there are concerns among\nstakeholders over employees and their role in the success of\nsuch initiatives like 3PL outsourcing (Boohene & Williams,\n2012). There is nothing on the O&G in Nigeria, though there\nare opportunities for local competencies development\nThe main objective of this research is to highlight how the\nbenefits of 3PL can support the international supply chain\nprocesses in the OICs operating in an emerging economy of\nNigeria. It intends to establish the challenges associated with\n3PL outsourcing by the international oil companies (IOCs),\nconsidering the specific logistics constraints and the unique\nwork situations in Nigeria. It aims to contribute to the gen-\neral knowledge on international management, specifically\n3PL, and present one of the first studies on 3PL in Nigeria in\ngeneral and in the oil industry in particular.\nResearch Questions\nThe following research questions were considered to guide\nthis study:\nResearch Question 1: What challenges do the IOCs face\nin managing 3PL in Nigeria?\nResearch Question 2: Are in-house capabilities available\nin IOCs for managing the 3PL in Nigeria?\nResearch Question 3: How would the employees respond\nto 3PL outsourcing in Nigeria?\nResearch Objectives\nThe proliferation of 3PL vendors in Nigeria lead to a vendor\n\"hub\" formation to ensure skill development for project\nlogistics management for a complex and highly regulated oil\nthis study is to ascertain if the IOCs can have any challenges\nassociated with having the right set of 3PL vendors who can\nprovide them the unique industry logistics solutions in\nNigeria. The second objective is to establish if the IOCs have\nthe ability to manage interfaces with the external 3PL provid-\ners as supplier management is critical to its success (Lai,\nChu, Wang, & Fan, 2013). Self, Armenakis, and Schraeder\n(2007) argue that during change, organizational content,\norganizational processes, and organizational context can\nencourage employee resistance. Therefore, the third objec-\ntive is to determine how employees would respond to 3PL\noutsourcing and identify how IOCs manage this.\nOrganization of This Article\nThe article consists of five sections as follows. Next to this\nintroduction is a detailed literature review of 3PL and logis-\ntics in the oil business. Then methodology and methods\ndeployed in the research are discussed in the next session. In\nthe subsequent section, the results of the research are pre-\nsented, along with the discussions on the findings. Finally,\nconclusions are drawn based on the outcome of the result,\nand the implications of the results are discussed.\nLiterature Review\nExtant literatures on outsourcing of logistics function indi-\ncate that there is increased interest in the management of\n3PLs. Several studies conducted in the past show trends in\nthree major classes, namely, 3PL practices showing regional\ndifferences, those with emerging global strategies, and those\non logistics outsourcing practices (Arroyo et al., 2006;\nRahman, 2011). In this section, existing literature is reviewed\nin three main areas: global outsourcing and 3PL, managing\n3PL and associated relationships, and the change manage-\nment perspective of 3PL adoption by organizations.\nTheoretical Framework\nThe theoretical framework of this study anchors on two prin-\ncipal theories--the Resource-Based (RBT) and Network\nTheories (NT). With the RBT, the IOCs can own and mobi-\nlize resources that are relevant for logistics services.\nCompanies access 3PL provider resources to save cost for\ntheir logistics needs and also improve their logistics services.\nThey draw from the NT to gain from the dependencies avail-\nable through their relationship with the 3PL providers.\nHowever, switching to 3PL outsourcing implies change man-\nagement. In sum, for IOCs to engage in 3PL outsourcing,\nthey need specific capabilities for relationship management\nEtokudoh et al. 3\nand change processes involving the management of employee\nreactions to switch from in-house activities to outsourcing.\nThus, this study aims to examine the extent to which 3PL\nvendors in Nigeria are ready to provide logistics support to\ncompanies operating in the Oil and Gas industry.\nRBT and NT: A brief review. RBT emphasizes that organiza-\ntions combine resources through complex and unique pat-\nterns that give competitive advantage (Barney, 1991).\nOrganizations can gain complementary resources through\n3PLwhich can translate into competitive advantage. Through\nRBT framework, firms can combine own resources with new\nand third party resources to cope with the ever changing mar-\nket dynamics (Lin & Wu, 2014). The 3PL outsourcing results\nin synergies that increase logistics asset of the providers.\nZacharia et al. (2011), however, see this from the Transaction\nCost Economics perspective, in which 3PL outsourcing\nresults in synergies that increase providers' logistics assets.\nThis results in increased combined activities for 3PL users;\nthus, economies of scope and scale and eventually reduced\ntransaction costs are achieved. Underdeveloped resources\ncould, however, be a deterrent to effective leverage of such\nexternal resources. As Jennings (1996) argues, cost of start-\ning and running outsourcing services could be a setback for\n3PL. Thus, it is possible for transaction cost to increase\nwhere much coordination of external parties is required.\nNT emphasizes collaborations from relationship manage-\nment resulting in economic gain. Leuschner, Carter, Goldsby,\nand Rogers (2014) find that relationship enables 3PLs and\ntheir customers to work closely together to improve logistics\ncustomer service and enhance overall firm performance. It is\nrelevant in buyer\u00adseller relationships and 3PL networks\nwhere complex systems give rise to network complexities\n(Hearnshaw & Wilson, 2011; Yan, Francesco, Zhang, &\nYang, 2013). Such relationships, however, would require\neffective change management processes in introducing 3PL\ninto the Nigerian O&G because of the likely multifaceted\nchallenges that could arise (Abdulraheem, Mordi, Ojo, &\nParker, Charlton, Ribeiro, & Pathak, 2013).\nOutsourcing and Globalization\nThrough outsourcing, organizations engage external suppli-\ners or service providers to accomplish not only noncore\nactivities but also some core activities (Michela & Carlotta,\n2011). Outsourcing involves such steps as third party sup-\nplier selection and managing relationships (Girma & Gorg,\nresource optimization, competitive advantage, investment\nand growth opportunities, and risk management (Lai et al.,\nThere are, however, some downsides of outsourcing\nOutsourcing can result in loss of technological capabilities\nand industrial decline in manufacturing firms. Outsourcing\norganizations risk loss of key competencies, control of sup-\npliers, and management skills for coordinating multiple\nfunctions. Costs of developing data for process and rela-\ntionships management, internal misgivings and fears over\nreliability, and increased management requirements could\nhinder organizations embracing outsourcing. However, as\nwith any change processes, it is assumed that an effective\nchange management process can help overcome these\nlimitations.\nOutsourcing is expanding fast, as a globalization process\ncourtesy of trade liberalization increased competitive pres-\nsures and developments in information technology (Capasso,\nCusmano, & Morrison, 2013; Lewin, Massini, & Peeters,\nschools of thought (Peng, 2011). First are those who attribute\nthe 21st-century technological advancements to the birth of\nglobalization, associating it with imposition of multination-\nals on the world. The second see globalization as part of\n\"human history\" that evolves with time.\nThe third school, the pendulum view, reason that global-\nization has always existed, but with periodic progressions\nand retardations. It connects with pre\u00adWorld War I business\ncycle risks on stocks in European markets (Nitschka, 2013;\nargue that the periodic swings in globalization have negative\nimpact like the 2008 global decline that was occasioned by\nthe United States's financial crisis. They, however, uphold\nthat globalization has been instrumental to the increased\n\"technical efficiency\" among the European countries.\nThe benefits from globalization have direct bearing in off-\nshore outsourcing (Agrawal, Goswami & Chatterjee, 2010),\nsuch as high value-adding activities outsourcing for innova-\ntiveness, savings on labor cost, adoption of industry best\npractices, and managing competitive pressures (Bertrand &\ndifferentials result in cheaper costs of production for some\nactivities in specific countries, giving them comparative\nadvantage for outsourcing (Capasso et al., 2013). Some\nregions host specific knowledge in some fields, specializing\nin them with high innovation capabilities and thus attracting\noutsourcing of related activities while articulating channels\nfor transformation of such knowledge to end users ((Almeida\nOshri, 2014). Multinationals with huge resource base and\nhigh absorptive capacity for knowledge management deploy\noffshore outsourcing as part of its global strategy thus lower-\ning \"transaction and coordinating cost\" (Bertrand, 2011).\nThere are concerns, however, on offshore outsourcing.\nOrganizations require ample knowledge, capability, and ade-\nquate resources to effectively coordinate and make decisions\non offshore outsourcing (Bertrand, 2011; Bertrand & Mol,\n4 SAGE Open\n3PL as offshore outsourcing initiative. The predominant logic is\nthat to be competitive, businesses should achieve high effi-\nciencies in their operations and processes by focusing on\ncore competencies while outsourcing noncore areas like\nlogistics activities (Ho, He, Lee, & Emrouznejad, 2012;\nLambert, Knemeyer, & Gardner, 2004). Limitations of\nappropriability hazards may, however, negatively influence\nthe effectiveness of such values to business firms where cli-\nents' core knowledge is needed in the outsourcing activities\n(Boguslauskas & Kvedaraviciene, 2009; Martinez-Noya,\nLogistics involves movements of people and materials. The\nbenefits of logistics outsourcing have been reported severally\nto include cost savings, concentrating of core competencies,\nprofessionalism, customer satisfaction, speed of service deliv-\nery, resource optimization, and gaining competitive advantage\nRabinovich, Windle, Dresner, & Corsi, 1999; Sohal et al.,\ncan result in improvement of organizational performance with\ncost leadership and innovative differentiation strategies\nOutsourcing for small- and medium-scale enterprises,\nhowever, appears not to achieve improved logistics perfor-\nmance (Solakivi, Toyli, Engblom, & Ojala, 2011). Savings\nfrom logistics outsourcing not reinvested in other activities\nlead to negative impacts (Dabhilkar & Bengtsson, 2008).\nAlso, logistics outsourcing may result in loss of employee\nmorale, loss of skills, overdependence on suppliers, and poor\ncontract design and implementation (Kremic, Tukel, & Rom,\nSeveral scholars have conducted country-specific\nresearches on 3PL outsourcing. Rahman (2011) reports the\nuse of 3PL in 40% of Australia's logistics needs, with a\npotential increase in the future. Sohal et al. (2002) project\nincreased internationalization of 3PL in Australia. Lieb et al.\n(1993) report longer 3PL usage among European manufac-\nturers than in United States. Usage of 3PL in Europe and the\nUnited States is higher than in Mexico, with the former\nfocusing more on cost servings and service integration while\nMexico focuses more on customer services and core compe-\ntencies (Arroyo et al., 2006). China prefers 3PL providers\ninvesting in relationship building, reputation, and informa-\nand Pei-Yu (2016) propose that the right integration between\n3PLs and their customers leads to better flexibility and\nenhanced customer satisfaction and productivity.\nManaging 3PL and Associated Relationships\nBuyer\u00adseller relationships can mar or make the value chain\nactivities' effectiveness and efficiency (Ackerman, 1996;\nPaulraj & Chen, 2007). Beneficial client\u00adlogistics provider\nrelationship should be strategic, improving with time, and\nwith good management interfaces, that deepens the\nrelationship as long-term logistics outsourcing relationship\nshould encourage trade-offs, trust, and beneficial synergies\n2006). The 3PL relationship concerns bother on service\nintegration, relationship solutions, and dependency issues,\nand would require interorganizational relationship manage-\nment which takes cognizance of collaboration, integration,\nand cultural elements in such relationships (Boyson, Corsi,\nAchieving improved 3PL service satisfaction and perfor-\nmance requires effective use of power in the social exchange\nwith suppliers, efficient management of \"economic transac-\ntions\" with suppliers, and good \"relationship-specific invest-\norientation--the propensity of the service provider to attend to\nthe service user's needs--and dependability--the 3PL provid-\ner's ability to offer regularly adequate services and the capabil-\nitytoamenddeliverablestoalignwiththeuser'spreferences--are\ncritical in 3PL relationship (Anderson, Coltman, Devinney, &\norative monitoring of service performance, and \"long-term rela-\ntionship\" are equally important in managing logistics\noutsourcing as they deliver sustainable performance, create\nopportunity for early resolution of conflicts, and provide chan-\nnels for relationship severance without the rigors of legal and\nThis, however, will work better in relationships that last long\nenough to encourage moral and financial investments for con-\nflict resolutions.\nDependency theory (DT) and NT in 3PL relationships.Through\nDT, organizations depend on external suppliers or vertically\nintegrated processes to enhance their supply chain effective-\nness and efficiency, thus gaining competitive advantage via\nin logistics is better through processes and systems integration\nas it enables flexibility in competitive environments. Thus,\nintegration and interorganizational relationships would reduce\nmanagement processes and asset ownership, improving finan-\ncial performance and dependence in 3PL, which aligns with\nZacharia et al.'s (2011) argument on NT. Consistent with these\npositions, Rabinovich et al. (1999) argue that logistics out-\nsourcing improves customer services, information coordina-\ntion, and economies of scale and scope. Boyson et al. (1999),\nhowever, observe that specific management skills are impor-\ntant in mitigating failures in 3PL relationships management.\nIn Nigeria, do the IOCs have the in-house capabilities to\nmanage the interorganizational relationships with 3PL pro-\nviders and do they have the capabilities to form a vertical\nintegration in 3PL processes to gain such dependencies that\nwould guarantee a strategic supply chain solution through\nthe 3PL? This is the basis for Research Question 2: Are in-\nhouse capabilities available in IOCs for managing the 3PL?\nEtokudoh et al. 5\nChange Management Perspective of 3PL\nAdoption by OICs\nUsing 3PL services implies a change from the traditional in-\nhouse operations. It involves shrinking internal logistics\nactivities and shifting same to the 3PL providers.\nUncertainties, fears, and frustration from this, along with\nlong-held practices and routines, may increase employees'\nunwillingness to change (Bhatnagar et al., 1999; Gondo,\nAccording to Self et al. (2007), the organizational content,\norganizational processes, and organizational context of\nchange do influence how employees react to organizational\nchange. Organizational content of change implies the impact\nsuch a change has on employees, and can cause affective and\ncognitive resistance. Organizational processes can also\nchange during 3PL transition; as IOCs use structured plat-\nforms, developing new standards and processes for 3PL\nimplementation could drive employee behavioral resistance.\nAlso, contextually global competitiveness and internal pro-\ncess improvements during 3PL outsourcing can cause\nemployee resistance. Change management process and prac-\ntices may thus be important during 3PL adoption.\nScarce Research on Emerging Economies and Oil\nIndustry\nMuch 3PL research has focused on the developed countries\nmostly on services and manufacturing industries with noth-\ning on 3PL outsourcing in the oil industry (Arroyo et al.,\nheightened by the employees'likely negative reaction to 3PL\nfact, referring to social sustainability, Hosang (2017) identify\nemployees as one of the main drivers whose welfare and\nwell-being are of concern to various stakeholders including\ngovernment.\nGlobal Outsourcing (2015) lists the commonly outsourced\nfunctions to include \"information technology tasks such as\nmicrochip development as well as many business services\nsuch as finance and accounting, human resources, data entry,\nand customer support centers\" (p. 1) and do not include the\nOil and Gas industry per say. Knowledge localization results\nin regions having expertise in certain activities, and there are\nsector-driven unique logistics solutions (Almeida & Kogut,\nPrencipe, 2012). The oil sector has its peculiar logistics chal-\nlenges such as oil exporting country-specific economic prac-\ntices, oil-related environmental issues, and monopolistic\ninfluences, making oil exporting countries perform poorly in\nHowever, emerging economies have huge growth oppor-\ntunities with the potential to develop their local competencies\nand step up their professionalism (PricewaterhouseCoopers,\nproducer with poor infrastructure, poor policy implementa-\ntion, lack of technological and human resources, and bureau-\ncracy which could hamper logistics (Hilmola, 2011; Ugboaja,\n2010). Nigeria currently has a logistics hub for oil and gas\noperations which can contribute to knowledge build-up and\nsupport collaboration between 3PL providers and users\nlogistics in Nigeria but their focus was on the manufacturing\nindustry. Wright et al. (2017) carry out a study on 3PL out-\nsourcing in some African countries including Nigeria but was\non the service industry. They, however, acknowledge that use\nof 3PL in Nigeria has potential benefits to customers. No 3PL\nresearch is made on the Oil and Gas industry in Nigeria\n(Rahman, 2011). This justifies the need to research on this\nphenomenon in Nigeria and particularly in the oil industry.\nResearch Methodology\nDesign, methods, and philosophy are critical in management\nresearch to enable objective inferences from inputs emanat-\ning from \"social actors\" (Miller & Tsang, 2011; Wahyuni,\n2012). Methodology covers the participants and sites, the\nrole of the researcher, data gathering techniques, data analy-\nsis process, and trustworthiness of the method.\nResearch Methodology\nTraditionally, 3PL research involves large samples for empir-\nical measures and evidential facts, thus quantitative approach\n2008). However, unlike such cases which test the applicabil-\nity of established processes under different scenarios, this\nresearch seeks to achieve deeper understanding of how 3PL,\na known concept in transportation services, would work in a\nspecialized oil industry under unique and challenging emerg-\ning market environment--making exploratory, case study\nmethod a preferred option which is already proven excellent\ntool for logistics research (Easterby-Smith, Thorpe, &\naddress credibility issue about generalization which is criti-\ncized in single case studies, multicase approach involves\nmore than one organization.\nTable 1 compares the quantitative approach and the quali-\ntative approach. Where \"detailed explanation of best prac-\ntices\" is being sought, exploratory, qualitative methods are\nbetter options (Ellram, 1996). Such approaches allow the\nobserver to be part of the process he or she is observing, tak-\ning into consideration the observer's (human) interest, and\nthus be able to accommodate elements of subjectivity. Rather\nthan using statistics, they enable the observer to gather data\nand form ideas, thus supporting sense making.\nJustification for using case study method. In line with the goal\nof this article to gain deeper understanding of the IOCs'chal-\nlenges and proffer effective ways to manage 3PL within\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

A total of 40 participants were\nselected using convenience sampling. Discriminate sampling\nprocess was used to systematically select eligible candidates\nand organizations to avoid bias and/or lack of precision\nwhich are associated with convenience sampling (Easterby-\nSampling--Who the participants were.A total of 10 partici-\npants were interviewed from one IOC, while five partici-\npants were interviewed in each of the other two IOCs. All the\n20 participants from the IOCs were either from the logistics\nor procurement functions: three were managers, two heads of\nunits, two planners, seven 3PL contract holders (CH), and six\nlogistics staff or those supporting logistics function.\nFrom the service providers, one of the providers was a\nmajor 3PL service contractor providing integrated logistics ser-\nvices to all the OICs under investigation. Ten participants were\ninterviewed, including two managers, three relationship offi-\ncers, three heads of logistics operations, and two logistics per-\nsonnel.Atotal of five participants each from the remaining two\n3PL providers were interviewed including their chief executive\nofficers (2), heads of different operations (4), heads of client\nservices (2), and other personnel involved in operations (4).\nTable 2 shows the different participants in the research\ninterview and their roles in 3PL in their organizations, justi-\nfying their eligibility and inclusion in the interview process\nand a check against research bias by the researcher's active\ninvolvement.\nAccess to participants. Convenience sampling was used in this\nresearch for easy access to participants based on determined\nnonprobability parameters and availability (Ozdemir, St\nLouis, & Tophas, 2011), using their work experience and the\nresearcher's network and relationships in the oil industry.\nCriteria for choice of participants. Different participants were\nchosen with emphasis on their roles in 3PL services that are\nlinked to the research problems:\ni. The logistics managers and procurement managers of\nthe IOCs were relevant in relationship issues and\nchange management in the 3PL.\nii. The executives and commercial managers were rele-\nvant in providing insights into the issues with client\ninterface and relationship management.\niii. The holders of 3PL contracts in the IOCs were\ninvolved because of their knowledge of the capability\nof their organizations to manage the 3PL contracts.\niv. Employees involved in logistics operations were key\nin understanding internal organizational challenges\nthat could rob on the 3PL operations.\nEthical issues.Ethical issues exist regarding information\ngathering in Nigeria's oil industry. Approval was obtained\nfrom Department of Petroleum Resources, the organization\nthat served as a major joint venture partner to the IOCs, for\nthe research's information gathering. Also, pre-interview\nquestion samples were sent ahead of the interview to help\nparticipants understand interview trend. A commitment to\nmaintain absolute confidentiality of participants and organi-\nzations was also given, thus the noninclusion of participants'\nand organizations' details in the research.\nData Gathering Techniques\nAccording to in-depth interviews, purposive sampling and\nrecording of interviews were used in line with case study\nTable 1.

Adapted from Easterby-Smith, Thorpe, and Jackson (2012,\nEtokudoh et al. 7\nInitial pilot tests were conducted to develop interview ques-\ntions which were further tested with another set of partici-\npants to confirm clear understanding of interviews. Eleven\nand 10 open-ended and progressive questions were used as\nguide in the interview sessions with the IOCs and 3PL ser-\nvice providers, respectively (Apendices A and B), and sent to\nparticipants ahead of interviews. Purposive sampling method\nwas used to determine participants' qualification, ensuring\ntheir eligibility, along with quota sampling method in which\nparticipants were categorized by their roles/positions.\nFollowing approval from the Department of Petroleum\nResources - Nigerian government regulatory agency for oil\nand gas activities (DPR), organizations were contacted and\ndates for interviews scheduled, interviews were held and\nrecorded serially on paper, and data properly labeled for\nidentification and processing.\nData Analysis Process\nRecorded discussions were reviewed severally using the\nconstant comparison method; data were compared across\ndifferent participants' and commonalities drawn to gain in-\ndepth understanding. Iterative process was also employed, in\nwhich participants were contacted more than once for clarifi-\ncation where necessary and the information combined with\nother participants' for better understanding.\nTrustworthiness of the Method Used\nValidity of both method and data.Research methods need to\nguarantee the acceptability and transferability of a research\net al., 2004). Internal validity, producing similar understanding\nunder different tests, was assured through use of various meth-\nods including convenience, constant comparison, and iterative\nmethods to ensure proper representation of participants and\nbetter understanding of issues thus minimizing biases. External\nvalidity, producing similar results outside research environ-\nment, was assured by use of pretesting process for external\nclarity and engagement of 40 participants across six organiza-\ntions well beyond the eight interviews that are considered ade-\nquate for data dependability (Zacharia et al., 2011).\nReliability of method. Reliability, the ability of an experiment to\nprovide consistent measurements across different tests, was\nguaranteed through rigorous and transparent constant compari-\nson and iterative approaches of data collection and analysis,\nalong with the pretesting and interview question refining exer-\ncises. This assurance of data consistency further adds credence\nto the generalizability of the research (Moss et al., 2004).\nGeneralizability. Case study method generates a lot of debate\non generalizability--research outcome being applicable out-\nside a given experiment--because of its relatively small\nsample size (Moss et al., 2004), but with proper representa-\ntion generalizability is achievable (Brannen & Nilsen, 2011;\nWood, 2009). Multicase study method involving three out of\nsix IOCs in Nigeria (50% of industry population) and a bal-\nanced approach that included 3PL providers were used. This\nprovided \"transparency and rigours\" of processes that make\nfor research generalizability (Brannen & Nilsen, 2011).\nPresentation of Results and Data\nAnalysis\nThis session provides findings and in-depth analysis of data\nusing a \"systematic approach (and) reliable platform\" that\nwould address concerns of inconsistencies associated with\ndiffering results in social contexts ( Moss et al., 2004).\nFindings and Analysis\nOutsourcing of logistics services. Table 3 shows the number of\nparticipants and how they were selected. The table consists\nof participants from both IOCs and 3PL providers, their\nroles, and how they were distributed. Twenty participants\nrepresenting 50% were chosen from the IOCs, and another\n50% from the 3PL providers. A total of 5% of the partici-\npants were Executives from the 3PL providers. Managers\ninterviewed were 13% of the total population, 8% from the\nIOCs and 5% from the service providers. In all, 27% of the\nparticipants were Heads of Departments or Planners, 10%\nfrom the IOCs, and 17% from the service providers. A total\nof seven CH were interviewed representing 17% of the popu-\nlation, all from the IOCs. Five Relationship Officers from\n3PL providers were interviewed, representing 13% of the\npopulation. In all, 25% of the population interviewed were\nordinary employees, 15% from the IOCs and 10% from the\nservice providers.\nThe participants were asked if their organizations adopted\n3PL outsourcing or if they provided such outsourced services\nto the IOCs. In all, 100% confirmed there were outsourced 3PL\nservices within the oil industry and particularly in the IOCs.\nTable 3.

For confidentiality, the\nOICs are referred to as Company A, Company B, and\nCompany C. Company A outsourced its Land and Marine\nTransport operations, representing 33% of its Land and\nMarine activities while it handled request processing and\nplanning. Company B outsourced its request processing,\nplanning, and execution of the same services representing\n60% but vetted all plans and also participated partly in the\nexecution including owning some of the logistics equipment\nused for the operations. Company C owned most of the\nmarine and land transport equipment, and also participated in\noperations and vetting of plans. Actual activities outsourced\nby Company C were planning and request processing, with\nlittle of execution and equipment ownership, representing\n40% of the activities.\nAviation services included 10 activities: request process-\ning, scheduling, booking, baggage handling, maintenance,\ncommunication with technical team/crew, ownership of spe-\ncific facilities, flight operations, manifest publication, and\nmanagement of the health and safety (HSE) aspects of the\noperations for noncommercial flights. Companies A and C\noutsourced 90% of the activities, retaining only the HSE\naspect, while Company B outsourced 80% retaining resource\nownership and HSE aspects.\nInternational Freight services were also almost entirely out-\nsourced. Companies A and B outsourced 60% of the activities\nconsisting of freight collection, transportation, and Customs\nclearance, and retained Customs duty payment and documen-\ntations. Company C outsourced 100% of International Freight.\nThere were, however, exceptional cases where those roles\nwere either reversed or they complement each other in all the\nthree IOCs. Local Ports Handling operation was 100% out-\nsourced by the IOCs.\nOverall, Companies B and C perceived there were huge\nopportunities in the future. This included full outsourcing in\nalmost all the components of logistics service.\nOutsourcing of logistics services from the 3PL providers' perspec-\ntive.Figure 2 shows the percentage averages of the out-\nsourced activities being wholly handled by the service\nproviders across all operations. Port Operations and Manage-\nment of Equipment are 100% handled by service providers in\nall operations that include Marine Services, Land Transport,\nand Port Operations. Ownership of Equipment scored 37%\nfor Marine Services, the lowest in all the activities. On aver-\nage, Land Transport recorded 88% of outsourced services\nwholly handled by service providers, followed by Port Oper-\nations with 83%, and lastly Marine Services at 81%.\nBenefits and challenges of 3PL in O&G.Participants were\nequally interviewed on what they considered as benefits of\n3PL outsourcing and what constituted challenges in effec-\ntively implementing the process. The benefits and challenges\nof outsourcing are presented in Table 4. The table consists of\npercentages of respondents from the IOCs and 3PL providers\naccording to the identified benefits or challenges.\nBoth the IOCs and the 3PL providers agreed that there\nwere benefits from the outsourcing of logistics services by\nthe IOCs. The IOCs recorded highest scores of 95% on pro-\nfessionalism and resource optimization, and 90% in effi-\nciency. The service providers recorded 100% on\nprofessionalism, efficiency, resource optimization, shared\ncosts, and organizational strategy.\nNo IOC participants agreed that micro managing service\nproviders or their organizational cultural differences were a\nchallenge; rather, they felt such was strength in enforcing\ntheir organizational standards. Comparatively, the service\nproviders scored 85% and 60%, respectively, indicating they\nwere important challenges for them. Similarly, the IOCs\nscored low in information flow and staff changes, unlike the\nservice providers that scored 100% and 85%, respectively.\nOverall, average of 76% of respondents accepted there\nwere benefits in outsourcing, with six activities recording\n80% and above. In all, 65% indicated challenges in outsourc-\ning, with four activities scoring above 70%.\nNigerian environment.Interview was carried out on recur-\nring issues emanating from the Nigerian environment, and\nthe findings as perceived by respondents from both IOCs\nand 3PL providers are presented in Table 5. The table shows\nthe percentage of participants from the IOCs and 3PL pro-\nviders who responded on given environmental factors, and\nalso gives average of these respondents for each environ-\nmental factor.\nFigure 1. Activity outsourcing by IOCs.\nNote. IOC = International Oil Company.\nEtokudoh et al. 9\nSix key environmental issues were identified as negatively\nimpacting 3PL outsourcing in O&G with average score of\n76%. Poor infrastructure, insecurity in the oil producing area,\nand host community interference on 3PL contracting scored\n80% and above. Highest score in IOCs was 100% in IOCs for\ninsecurity and community issues, while lowest was 55% for\nhigh cost of operations. For the service providers, highest\nscore of 95% was recorded in poor infrastructure and lowest\nof 50% in underdeveloped market for logistics outsourcing.\nOrganizational resources for 3PL.

Relationship skill was considered\nby most participants (90%), followed by training and develop-\nment resources (80%). In all, 63% of participants accepted that\nthe IOCs have relationship skills to manage 3PL outsourcing,\nwhile only 45% accepted that information technology for man-\naging 3PL existed in IOCs.\nEmployee response to logistics outsourcing. In all, 75% of par-\nticipants acknowledged that employees were reluctant to\naccept the transfer of activities they were doing in-house to\nexternal parties. Interestingly, 100% of respondents from the\nIOCs stated that resistance from employees was unlikely to\nlead to failure of implementation of 3PL outsourcing by their\norganizations.\nManaging potential for failure.Participants were asked to\nassess the tendency for logistics outsourcing to derail or fail\noutright and how the potential is managed.\nAverage of 65% of participants acknowledged the possibil-\nity of failure of 3PL outsourcing unless it is effectively man-\naged. Likely failure was attributed to either employee-related\nissues or vendor-related issues. Table 7 indicates the resources\nparticipants considered that the IOCs were using to manage\n3PL from failing. For employee-related issues, information\nmanagement (58% of respondents), exit strategy (40%), and\ntop management involvement (70%) were identified. For ven-\ndor-related issues, effective contract management (70%) and\ndirect support to vendors (85%) were identified.\nDiscussion of Findings\nDiscussions on the data are presented here. The discussion is\nbroken into logistics outsourcing, 3PL benefits, and chal-\nlenges of 3PL in O&G; Nigerian environment and organiza-\ntional resources for 3PL; and employee response to 3PL and\nmanaging potential for failure.\nLogistics outsourcing, 3PL benefits, and challenges of 3PL in\nO&G. From the findings, logistics outsourcing was already in\npractice in the O&G in Nigeria. Benefits identified are similar\nto those reported by Arroyo et al. (2006), Rabinovich et al.\nfrom logistics operations), professionalism (focusing on core\nbusiness areas), resource optimization (not tying their invest-\nments on logistics resources and assets), specialized service\ndelivery and delivery speed (ability to access professional\nlogistics services with guaranteed efficiency and effective-\nness), and service integration (flexibility in operations).\nResult, however, records highest responses on profession-\nalism, resource optimization, and efficiency compared with\nSohal et al.'s (2002) customer service, flexibility, and sav-\nings in investment, and Rahman's (2011) cost reduction, sav-\nings in investment, and flexibility. It is suspected that the\ndifference could be because these other researchers investi-\ngated routine product distribution\u00addriven organizations,\nunlike the O&G where logistics demands are inconsistent\nand thus logistics resource optimization critical. Moreover,\ntheir study was based in a developed country Australia with\nestablished efficiency factors. Nigeria is a developing coun-\ntry constrained with logistics inefficiencies (Hilmola, 2011),\nthus professionalism and efficiency would be critical.\nResource optimization was of particular interest in the\nO&G. IOCs are sharing some marine logistics assets and han-\ndling and lifting equipment with other organizations.\nOutsourcing would enable them release huge resources from\nassets that are underutilized. This is consistent with Rahman's\n(2011) findings that 3PL services reduce both operational cost\nof services and capital costs of investment. In addition, O&G\nlogistics demands are unpredictable and urgent requiring pro-\nfessional, flexible, and effective services which the 3PL pro-\nviders are better equipped to provide (Girma & Gorg, 2004;\nthe IOCs deploying their relationship management capabili-\nties, right integration between 3PL providers and the IOCs is\nexpected to produce better flexibility, increased productivity,\nand customer satisfaction (Chiung-Lin and Pei-Yu, 2016).\nChallenges such as information flow, micro managing\n(control), and differences in organizational cultures are\nconsistent with Lieb et al.'s (1993) findings. However, ven-\ndor capability, information flow, and JVP interventions\nidentified as three challenges most participants selected in\nthe result differ from those identified by Sohal et al. (2002).\nThese differences are also attributable to the differences in\ngeographical locations. Such differences underlie the\nTable 6.

PL = Party Logistics; IOC = International Oil Company.\nuniqueness in country characteristics, highlighting the need\nto recognize differences in the application of 3PL outsourc-\ning across the borders (Arroyo et al., 2006).\nThe benefits of 3PL in Nigeria justify the need to retain\nthese services. IOCs in Nigeria are contending with pipeline\nfailures due to activities from illegal operators. They also\nface environmental issues such as pollution and losses from\ntheft. By outsourcing logistics, they would be focused on\ntechnology development in the O&G that can address these\nHow challenges in IOCs impact benefits of 3PL.The unique\nchallenges observed in the findings suggest that peculiarities\nin 3PL application could cause country-specific challenges\nin 3PL implementation (Arroyo et al., 2006). This leads to\nthe Research Question 1: What challenges do the IOCs face\nin managing 3PL in Nigeria?\nIOCs operate with global standards and require compe-\ntent 3PL vendors with adequate resources to implement these\nstandards in IOC-related logistics operations, but the\nNigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (Local\nContent) Act 2010 mandates exclusive consideration of local\nservices organizations for O&G operations (Ovadia, 2013).\nfindings indicate that local logistics vendors lack adequate\ncapability for logistics services for the IOCs in Nigeria.\nContrary to Ihua (2010), evidence from this research con-\nfirms that IOCs do provide capacity-building support, such\nas liaison with banks for local vendor funding, advanced\npayment for services, consultancy, and training. This sug-\ngests a new drive by the IOCs to overcome their logistics\nconstrains that tend to hinder their operations while gradu-\nally implementing the Local Content Act 2010 (Ovadia,\nthat integration as a new form of relationship management in\nlogistics outsourcing in unpredictable environments like\nNigeria is beneficial for financial improvement and customer\nsatisfaction.\nPersonnel training was an interesting discovery. In all,\n67% of the 3PL providers were found to have their personnel\ntrained by the IOCs, suggesting that most 3PL providers\ndepended on the IOCs for the capacity building. Thus,\nknowledge gap may have been more of a challenge for the\n3PL providers than for the IOCs.\nClosely related to the capacity of local vendors was the\nJVP's influence on the choice of strategy for 3PL outsourc-\ning and the sourcing of local vendors for the services. The\nJVP hold majority shares in the joint venture partnership\nwith the IOCs, enabling them to exert influence on the\nIOCs' decisions at the expense of ethically embedded cul-\nture of established organizations (Rossouw & Van Vuuren,\n2003). IOCs have to develop internal mechanisms for man-\naging these challenges. This explains why the IOCs were\nfound to design capability assessment processes to identify\ngaps among the local vendors and provide corresponding\ncapacity-building support. It was interesting to observe that\nthe IOCs sometimes rejected JVP's choices on vendors,\nbearing alone the cost of investing on their preferred ven-\ndors. This aligns with Rossouw and Van Vuuven's (2003)\ntotally aligned organization that upholds its ethical standard\nat all cost.\nAlthough information management has been considered a\ncritical factor in 3PL outsourcing (Leahy et al., 1995; Paulraj\nAdewoye, 2010), emphasis has been on 3PL provider's abil-\nity to provide robust and effective information platform.\nFindings from this research indicate service providers are\nlooking up to the IOCs, because of 3PL providers' inade-\nquate resources.\nIn summary and in response to the Research Question 1,\nthe IOCs do face challenges in managing 3PL outsourcing in\nNigeria mostly because of the peculiarity of service and con-\nditions in the country. The IOCs have their internal mecha-\nnism for managing these challenges. In addition, there are\nnumerous benefits of 3PL outsourcing in O&G that the IOCs\nare enjoying currently despite the current challenges of man-\naging the process. Evidence from this research indicates the\nIOCs are looking forward to further exploiting the opportu-\nnities of engaging in full 3PL outsourcing compared with\ntheir currently predominantly partial 3PL outsourcing preva-\nlent in the O&G in Nigeria.\nNigerian environment and organizational resources for 3PL.It\nwould have been expected that the Nigerian environmental\nuncertainties, poor transportation infrastructure/regulation,\nand unpredictable O&G logistics demands would be a major\nimpediment to IOCs' 3PL outsourcing because of their influ-\nence on supply chain strategies (Paulraj & Chen, 2007;\nUgboaja, 2010). The result, however, shows it was the 3PL\nproviders that emphasized the criticality of this factor and\nnot the IOCs. The IOCs see them as service providers' capa-\nbilities development opportunities, which is consistent with\nHilmola's (2011) argument for logistics-unfriendly countries\nto learn best practices. In addition, OIC's shifting the risks\nassociated with environmental uncertainties could be their\nShifting some risk managements to 3PL providers could\nbe a channel for the service providers to develop shared\nresources. This is consistent with Transaction Cost\nEconomics and Resource-Based Theory schools of thought\nabout business owners' decision on transaction cost reduc-\ntion and organizational resource combination for higher per-\nformance (Zacharia et al., 2011). The 3PL shared resources\nenhance IOCs'concentration on core competence, increasing\nperformance, and increase vendors' operations scale and\nscope, creating huge growth opportunities in the emerging\neconomies (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2010).\nIOCs would still have to contend with some of the risks\nthe service providers may not be able to handle. It makes\nsense then for the IOCs to want to handle the\nenvironment-driven negative factors that have to do with\nvendor characteristics as shown in the findings, while sup-\nporting them to grow the capacities they already have. This\nis most effective if specific competencies that have direct\nbearings with the O&G logistics operations are developed to\nassist in knowledge localization and development of logis-\ntics hubs for O&G (Almeida & Kogut, 1999; Zacharia et al.,\n2011). Logistics hub for O&G operations already exists in\nthe Oil & Gas Free Trade Zone located in the oil producing\nWhat organizational resources do the IOCs need to own.The\nquestion, then, is if the IOCs really need to own all logistics-\nrelated resources.Answering this would address the Research\nQuestion 2: Are in-house capabilities available in the IOCs\nfor managing 3PL?\nThe IOCs would be holding excess capacity should they\nretain resources meant for functions handled by the 3PL.\nFrom the findings, management of communities, vendors,\nand contracts were considered key for the IOCs. Consistent\n(2013), successful 3PL outsourcing practice requires sound\nmanagement resources associated with managing these\ninterfaces.\nManaging communities are similar to managing vendors.\nManaging 3PL contracts would, however, require additional\nskills such as the ability to scope contracts properly, specify\nclear responsibilities, avoid unrealistic promises and\ndemands, and make provisions for recouping investment\nthrough agreements that encourage future benefits\n(Ackerman, 1996). The 3PL providers argued during the\ninterviews that the IOCs needed logistics operations skills.\nTheir view is supported by Boyson et al. (1999) report that\nlogistics skills are important for managing logistics outsourc-\ning. IOCs, however, can draw from their social exchange\npower and management capabilities for their 3PL outsourc-\ning (Ulrich & Barney, 1984). Logistics skills needed for the\neffective management of the 3PL providers through daily\ninteraction with the providers can be acquired as a dynamic\nlearning capability, and as pointed out by Lin and Wu (2014),\nthis kind of learning process significantly improves perfor-\nmance. As the findings suggest and in line with reports on\ninternational organizations (Lai et al., 2013), skills and\nresources for contract, integration, and relationship manage-\nment exist among the IOCs.\nAckerman (1996) argues though that individual manag-\ners'personal interest could influence the outcome of logistics\noutsourcing. Such behaviors were reported during the inves-\ntigation but were minor. Such tendencies would only have\nminimal impact among the IOCs possibly because of the\ndominant and impulsively replicated positive behaviors\n(Gondo et al., 2013) existing in these companies.\nHowever, the results show the IOCs currently manage\n3PL piecemeal. They may need to scale up their capability\nfor managing huge and integrated 3PL services in the future.\nTherefore, in response to Research Question 2, it is con-\ncluded that the capabilities IOCs require for managing 3PL\nwould be mostly those resources for managing communities,\nvendors, and contracts. Key logistics operations capabilities\nmay not be prerequisites, because in the course of managing\nthe contracts, the critical logistics operations will be avail-\nable on need-to-know basis. The IOCs do have basic\nresources for managing 3PL outsourcing, but they would\nlikely need to develop the capability further to enable larger\nscale outsourcing management.\nEmployee response to 3PL and managing potential for fail-\nure.Findings indicated that initially employees from the\nIOCs were not favorably disposed to 3PL outsourcing. This\nis common in 3PL as a change process with employees'\nuncertainties, fears, and reinforced old behaviors (Boohene\nInterestingly, the IOCs were reported to be effective in\nmanaging communication. They understand and apply con-\ncepts of communication and change management in their\ndealing with employees (Mittal, 2012). Also, in line with\nSelf et al.'s (2007) explanation, the IOCs may be succeeding\nin the outsourcing process because they have been able to\nalign organizational content of 3PL outsourcing and the\norganizational processes for implementing it with the organi-\nzational context for the change in a seamless manner that\nwould be better appreciated and accepted by the employees.\nManaging potential failures and employee impact. An interest-\ning outcome from the interview was that respondents from\nboth the IOCs and the 3PL providers were in agreement that\nIOCs had not recorded failures in the implementation of any\n3PL outsourcing initiatives as a result of employee resis-\ntance. It would have been expected that IOCs with large\nworkforce would have challenges pushing through with\nchanges that the employees were reluctant to adopt. So why\nis this different in the case of IOCs in Nigeria? In attempting\nto answer this, the Research Question 3 will be addressed:\nHow would the employees respond to 3PL outsourcing?\nSeveral researches uphold that 3PL outsourcing lead to\nnegative impacts on employees and thus likely to lead to\nlogistics personnel have been reported to be impacted by 3PL\npost implementation impact including lowering of morale.\nThe findings show that extending 3PL services to inte-\ngrated package would meet negative response but such resis-\ntance was unlikely to result in failure of 3PL outsourcing\nimplementation. Lieb et al. (1993) report similar deviation\nand linked it to good relationship management. It implies\nthat the IOCs appreciate the import of employee contribution\nto firm success (Hosang, 2017), have sound skills in change\nmanagement, can coordinate the change through expert\nchange agents, and are able to motivate employees toward\nsum, regarding Research Question 3, employees in IOC are\nlikely to respond unfavorably to large-scale logistics out-\nsourcing. However, because the IOC have excellent resources\nfor managing change effectively, such reactions are likely to\nbe contained. Thus, resistance from employees would not\nresult in failure of implementation of 3PL outsourcing.\nConclusion\nThe article reveals that the IOCs face challenges in imple-\nmenting 3PL outsourcing in Nigeria, their peculiar logistics\nneeds, and the unique local conditions. Challenges identi-\nfied include 3PL providers' capability to deliver O&G-\nspecific logistics services, JVP influence in 3PL\nimplementation, and information management between\nIOCs and the service providers. The IOCs have internal\nmechanisms to manage these challenges. Moreso, 3PL out-\nsourcing benefits outweigh these challenges, justifying 3PL\noutsourcing by IOCs in Nigeria.\nThe article also establishes that Nigeria has unique\nlogistics issues such as underdeveloped logistics market,\nhost community challenges, and poor transportation infra-\nstructure. However, it was revealed that the IOCs only\nneeded relationship and contract management capabilities\nfor managing vendor development, contract management,\nand the management of communities which were logistics\nchallenges not within 3PL capabilities. The IOCs currently\nuse them in managing outsourced fragmented logistics ser-\nvices, but need further development for integrated logistics\nservices.\nContrary to most existing literature, IOC employees may\nrespond negatively initially to 3PL outsourcing but would\nend up accepting it. The IOCs have developed good manage-\nment practices that enable them manage employee issues\neffectively during 3PL outsourcing implementation. There\nare job losses during such exercises, but employees are usu-\nally prepared to eventually accept the change. This experi-\nence is unique and calls for further studies for possible\nadoption outside the IOCs.\nThe findings obtained therefrom add to the existing\nresearch on 3PL across national dimension from the IOCs\nwith the Nigerian perspective. Thus, the research contributes\nto the body of knowledge in the field of international busi-\nness and logistics outsourcing.\nImplications of the Research\nThe outcome of the research has some implications. First,\nacademically it debunks the long-held tradition that global\norganizations should always deploy their global standards\nand best practices across borders to achieve streamlined\noperations, economies of scale and scope, and transparent\nprocesses. Consistent with Schilke, Rehmann, and Thomas\n(2009), standardization may not always translate to good\nbusiness performance. As the research has shown, the\nNigerian environment requires home-grown resources and\ncapabilities that call for collaboration between the IOCs and\nlocal vendors that would lead to new capabilities for logistics\noperations in the O&G. It equally calls for dynamic learning\ncapabilities between the IOCs and local vendors to cope with\nvolatilities in the environment (Lin & Wu, 2014).\nSecond, it addresses management practices in the IOCs.\nOrganizations deploy 3PL outsourcing strategies with\nexpected gains which when not met lead to early termination\nof relationships with service providers (Ackerman, 1996;\nBoyson et al., 1999). IOCs would need to device new work-\ning relationships with their vendors that would result in their\ncapacity building. The research throws up the challenge for\nmanagers in IOCs to study and design a win-win partnership\nframework. As Yang and Zhao (2016) see it, this is an inno-\nvative means of managing logistics outsourcing relation-\nships. IOCs can leverage on the local vendors' capacity to\nmanage the challenging security in the oil producing areas,\ntheir reticence in coping with the poor logistics infrastructure\nin Nigeria to deliver logistics services, and their skill in net-\nworking with local operators to influence regulations, to\nsolve their peculiar logistics needs better. IOCs providing\nfinancial and technical support to the growing 3PL providers\nin Nigeria can assist in their capacity, improve 3PL services\nto the O&G, and develop globally competitive logistics ser-\nvice providers.\nThird, it emphasizes the importance of change manage-\nment in organizations. Change management tends to focus\non ideas level where consultants work with management\nteams of organizations to develop structures and resources\nwithout effective implementation (Parker et al., 2013). There\nis apparent lack of academic details in change processes on\ncomplex organizations (Kuipers et al., 2014). The experience\nwith the IOCs shows that properly designed and imple-\nmented change management processes can pay off.\nFourth, it highlights the need for a more robust and all-\ninclusive logistics outsourcing strategy by the IOCs to fully\nharness the benefits of 3PL outsourcing. An integrated logis-\ntics outsourcing with effective information sharing and pro-\ncess coordination (Liu, Huo, Liu, & Zhao, 2015) that\nprovides end-to-end service delivery would be more benefi-\ncial to the IOCs (Boyson et al., 1999; Rabinovich et al.,\ncurrently is lacking in the O&G in Nigeria. As the research\nindicates, however, the IOCs are contemplating such\ninitiative.\nLimitations of the Research\nThe research methodology was drawn from the case study\nmethod with generalization issues. Also, the interview ses-\nsions would introduce the probability of subjective results.\nAnother limitation came from the restricted mode of access-\ning information in the O&G in Nigeria. The oil and gas regu-\nlatory bodies in Nigeria imposed bureaucratic constraints to\naccessing information, limiting research to three instead of\nthe six IOCs intended by the researchers.\nDespite these limitations, the outcome is tenable. The\nmulticase study enabled the researcher to use credible meth-\nods for data processing, and to spread the interview across\nwide population of respondents, thus minimizing the chances\nof subjectivity and increasing its generalization. Concerning\nthe number of IOCs investigated, the research was able to\ncover three of the six IOCs in Nigeria, representing 50% of\nthe population.\nAreas for Further Studies\nThis article was an exploratory research. Having established\nthe workability of 3PL outsourcing by IOCs in Nigeria, an\nextensive and quantitative research would be required to fur-\nther test the applicability of this established concept under\ndifferent scenarios.\nAnother area for future study would be conducting a more\nfocused research on employee behavior with respect to 3PL\noutsourcing across different industries in Nigeria to deter-\nmine if the IOCs' unique result in which the employees tend\nto welcome rather than resist outsourcing is industry-specific\nor not.\nAppendix A\nResearch Interview Guide\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Is your organization outsourcing logistics activities?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 If so, why is that the preferred strategy, and if not, why\nis in-house operation the preferred option?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Can you mention the benefits for the preferred\noptions?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are the challenges your organization phase in\nimplementing logistics outsourcing?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Do you see the Nigerian environment fit for the logis-\ntics outsourcing?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What do you think would be organizational\nresources required for implementing the logistics\noutsourcing?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In your organization, do you think there are resources\nfor implementing the logistics outsourcing?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Are your organizational employees favorably dis-\nposed to the logistics outsourcing strategy?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Why do you think they are accepting/rejecting this\nstrategy?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Do you see their response to the logistics outsourcing\nas capable of making the strategy a successful\nexecution?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How does your organization manage any potential for\nfailure regarding logistics outsourcing?\nAppendix B\nInterview Guide for Third party logistics (3PL)\nProviders\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Is your organization providing outsourced logistics\nactivities directly to the International Oil Companies\n(IOCs)?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are the benefits for the IOCs compared with\nthem providing the services in-house?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are the challenges your organization experience\nproviding logistics services to the IOCs?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Do you see the Nigerian environment fit for the logis-\ntics outsourcing?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What do you think your organization requires to be\nable to provide outsourced logistics to the IOCs?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In your organization, do you think there are resources\nfor implementing the logistics outsourcing?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How does your organization manage relationships\nwith the IOCs?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Why do you perceive the IOCs employee attitude\ntoward your services to their organizations?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Do you see their response to the logistics outsourcing\nas capable of making the outsourced services provi-\nsion a failure?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How does your organization manage any potential for\nfailure regarding logistics services to the IOCs?\nAuthors' Note\nThe study was carried out as part of Master in Business\nAdministration studies of the lead author (Emah Patrick Etokudoh)\nat the University of Liverpool/Laureate, United Kingdom.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAbdulraheem, T., Mordi, C., Ojo, Y., & Ajonbadi, H.
