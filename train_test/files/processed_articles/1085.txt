This body of literature has confirmed that both individual and\ncontextual attributes are important dimensions of social determinants of health,\nthereby suggesting a research agenda that simultaneously considers factors\nlocated at different layers of social structure insofar as they influence health.\nThe bulk of this work has focused on community socioeconomic status\n(SES) which is typically measured by the average level of poverty, affluence,\nfamily income, wealth and education of local residents. The major con-\nclusion from these studies is that community SES is a significant contextual\ndeterminant of individual mental and physical health, although the effect\nof size is relatively smaller than that of individual-level SES (Kawachi and\nextent, community social and physical environments have also been exam-\nined as contextual determinants of health in their own right and as pathways\nlinking community SES to health. Following the hot debate about whether\nsocial capital1 is relevant to individual health outcomes (Chang and Christakis\nLynch 2002), recent empirical investigations that focus on social capital/\nsocial cohesion and health have provided evidence supporting the claim that\nsocial capital, both at the community level and at the state level, has a\nsignificant and positive effect on individual health (Browning and Cagney\nVeenstra 2002). Moreover, it has been reported that social resources such as\ncollective efficacy2 and reciprocity, that are present at the neighborhood\nlevel, play a mediating role on the link between contextual economic\nresources (e.g. affluence) and health (Wen et al. 2003). Previous work has\nalso found that poor neighborhoods tend to have more problems of broken\nglass or trash on streets and graffiti on buildings, and that these physical\nsigns of disorder are negatively associated with health (Barr et al. 2001, Ross\nThe literature on contextual effects on health has more or less revolved around\nthese structural, social and physical dimensions of community environment,\nwhereas other important aspects of community life have been much less\nstudied. As Macintyre and her colleagues (2003) recently argued, research on\nthe link between place and health need not be constrained by socioeconomic\nand psychosocial factors as studied by social cohesion/social-capital theorists,\nbut could also incorporate other aspects, including cultural, religious, political\nand historical characteristics of residential communities. Indeed, studying\nthese other aspects of community environment may not only reveal important\nyet previously unknown patterns of social ecological influences on health, but\nalso help to identify mechanisms that can explain the effects of community\nSES and social and physical disorders on individual health.\n560 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nThe current investigation is intended to focus on the prospective impact\nof community subcultural orientation on mortality in a particularly vulnerable\npopulation \u00ad older people afflicted with life-threatening diseases. We will\nexplore the linkages among economic forces, social resources, physical\ndisorder and cultural factors at the community level and their impacts on\nthe odds of mortality in later life. Of particular interest is our endpoint that\nmeasures the survival time between the incidence or diagnosis of disease and\ndeath. This outcome affords an excellent opportunity to assess the impact\nof contextual factors at a very vulnerable stage of life \u00ad being old and seriously\nill \u00ad and also serves the useful purpose of conditioning the effect on a given\nhealth state. By focusing on this special population of older patients, we\nattempt to test whether previous evidence on contextual effects can be\nexpanded into a secondary-prevention population with known life-threatening\ndiseases. We will also specifically examine whether tolerance of risk behaviours\nand prevailing values and beliefs as measures of community subcultural\norientation exert prospective and contextual effects on mortality, and whether\nthese subcultural patterns help explain the effects of community economic,\nsocial and physical environments on health.\nTheoretical and empirical background\nPoverty, low collective efficacy and physical disorder\nPoverty is the key source of many social problems. The early work of the\nChicago school urban sociologists suggested that economic problems were often\nspatially clustered with other social problems involving crime, delinquency,\nmental disorders and physical illness (Faris and Dunham 1960, Shaw and\nMcKay 1969). Arguably, a place seriously deficient in economic resources\nmay have a problem of sustaining good physical conditions, adequate health\nservices, efficient social institutions (e.g. family, church, sports clubs and\nother voluntary associations) and adequate local employment opportunities.\nThus, individuals who reside in poor areas are likely to suffer from daily\nstress and ill health.\nA sophisticated literature has consistently described the deleterious effect\nof community poverty on health even after controlling for individual\nother words, this work finds that community poverty contextually and\nsometimes prospectively increases one's risks for poor health or death, and\nthis relationship is not completely confounded or mediated by individual\nSES and other socio-demographic factors.\nThe protective effect of social resources at the community level has also\nbeen documented. For example, a recent study finds multilevel evidence\nthat individuals residing in Chicago neighbourhoods with higher levels of\ncollective efficacy report better overall health (Browning and Cagney 2002).\nAnother Chicago-based study also shows that community social capital \u00ad as\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 561\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nmeasured by reciprocity, trust and civic participation \u00ad was associated with\nlower community death rates, after adjustment for community material de-\nprivation (Lochner et al. 2003). Beyond the social capital/collective-efficacy\nperspective, institutional theories emphasise the role that schools, businesses,\npolitical organisations and social services play in the community (Crane 1991).\nNot surprisingly, poverty and social and physical environments at the\ncommunity level are linked. Ross and Mirowsky (2001) conducted a study\nexamining whether living in a disadvantaged Census tract damaged health,\nand whether community social and physical disorder mediated the asso-\nciation. They constructed an index of objective community disadvantage\nthat measured physical signs of disorder such as graffiti and abandoned\nbuildings, as well as negative social signs such as crime and people drinking\nor using drugs. They found that residents of disadvantaged communities\nhad worse self-reported health and physical functioning and more chronic\nconditions than residents of more advantaged neighbourhoods. Furthermore,\nthe association was mediated entirely by perceived community physical and\nsocial disorder and the resulting fear.\nThe link between poverty and a low stock of social resources in the\ncommunity has been illuminated long ago in Shaw and McKay's social dis-\norganisation theory (Shaw and McKay 1969). A central premise of this\nmodel is that structural barriers such as poverty impede development of the\nformal and informal ties that promote the ability to solve common problems\n(Sampson and Groves 1989). Although later evidence shows that poor urban\nareas can be tightly integrated with extensive patterns of social interaction\nthe capacity to achieve common goals among persons living in impoverished\nneighbourhoods (i.e. collective efficacy) is low, given that they may have\nlimited means to support each other.\nCommunity distress signalled by poverty, physical disorder and low\ncollective efficacy may affect health via multiple mechanisms. It is plausible\nthat, as an integral component of our social contexts, community milieu\naffects individual psychosocial experiences involving stress processes and\nbehavioural patterns that directly affect health. Meanwhile, the social and\neconomic disorganisation may nurture a lost sense of community, negative\ncommunity identification and aberrant behaviours (Wilson 1987). The\nensuing departure from mainstream patterns amounts to a set of norms,\nvalues, orientations and aspirations that are likely to be negative and health-\ncompromising.\nCulture-of-poverty model and the epidemic theory\nHere Oscar Lewis's culture-of-poverty arguments on the ghetto underclass\nmay shed light on how community social and structural distress may affect\nits cultural characteristics which have direct bearings on individual health\nlifestyles that inevitably affect health (Lewis 1968). Lewis defined the culture\nof poverty as `both an adaptation and a reaction of the poor to their marginal\n562 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nposition in a class-stratified, highly individuated, capitalistic society' (Lewis\n1968: 188). He argued that the culture of poverty `tends to perpetuate itself\nfrom generation to generation because of its effect on the children. By the\ntime slum children are age six or seven, they have usually absorbed the basic\nvalues and attitudes of their subculture and are not psychologically geared\nto take full advantage of changing conditions or increased opportunities which\nmay occur in their life-time' (1968: 188). Here it is important to note that\nLewis also realised and explicated that culture of poverty is structurally\nrooted and structural changes in society (e.g. redistributing wealth) can lead\nto modifications of the basic characteristics of the culture of poverty.\nIn other words, the culture-of-poverty perspective postulates that the poor\nwho reside in areas plagued by poverty and social problems, by virtue of\ntheir exclusion from mainstream society and their social isolation from\npositive role models, develop a lifestyle that is by nature different from that\nof the middleclass societies in which they live and that assumes a `life of\nits own', that is passed across generations through cultural transmission\nwith the contagion or epidemic theory suggesting that people's behaviours\nare influenced by the norms, values, orientations and aspirations of those\nLiving in distressed communities and being neighboured by other disad-\nvantaged people, therefore, enhance ones exposure to health-compromising\nattitudes and behaviours. And, at least in part, it is through the spread of\nnegative attitudes and risky behaviours that poverty and social dislocations\nare transferred to poor health in the community.\nIn this theoretical stream, the emphasis on anomic attitudes and deviant\nbehaviour echoes and expands earlier intellectual traditions on the concept\nof anomie (Orr\u00f9 1987). Durkheim was perhaps the first to introduce the\nanomie concept into sociology and used the concept to explain deviant\ndeveloped in the The Division of Labor (1933) and further elaborated in\nSuicide (1951). He was concerned with the inadequacy of socially generated\ngoals and values in industrial societies and the consequent destructive\nindividual behaviours due to the lack of normative guidance (Orr\u00f9 1989).\nHe used the concept of anomie to describe the erosion of standards and\nvalues characteristic of cultural or normative disorder that results from the\nlack of societal regulation (for whatever reasons). One consequence of this\nnormative disorder or anomie in a society or community is what Durkheim\nlabelled as `anomic suicide'. Building on Durkheim's work, Merton later modi-\nfied the anomie concept and described the consequences of an instrumental\nimbalance between cultural values and social norms and the ensuing condition\nwhere norms lost their regulatory power for the individual (Merton 1938,\nOrr\u00f9 1989). He thus incorporated the disjunction between cultural goals and\nsocially structured opportunity into the anomie framework (Cloward 1959).\nThe conception of anomie was further broadened by Leo Srole who not only\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 563\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nexplicitly specified five dimensions of the anomie concept but also conceived\nhis anomie scale and tested the scale in his own study (Srole 1956). While\nSrole admitted that his operational formulation of the anomie concept was\npreliminary and rather simplistic, the Srole anomia scale has proved to be\nuseful in applied research related to the anomie concept (Bullough 1967,\nWilson 1971). Although these theorists emphasised different aspects and\nconditions of anomie, all shared the view that the core component of anomie is\nnormlessness or a departure from the dominant mainstream culture. They\nalso have all argued or implied that the ensuing feelings of alienation in an\nanomic society or community are likely to foster maladaptive, antisocial and\nhigh-risk behaviour that inevitably compromises health in the long run.\nAnother version of this view that emphasises the link between anomic\nattitudes and deviant behaviour is epitomised in the subcultural transmission\nmodel. This model suggests that subcultures display distinctive health lifestyles,\nwith specific beliefs, knowledge and attitudes conditioning risk-taking\nbehaviour and health (Fitzpatrick and Lagory 2000). In some insulated and\ndeprived places, therefore, where long-term poverty, low labour force par-\nticipation, out-of-wedlock childbearing, school drop-out, welfare dependency\nand other social problems prevail, deviant role models emerge and encourage\nhealth-destructive behaviours such as use of illegal drugs and violence\nfrom racial and economic segregation, limited opportunities and little hope\nfor upward mobility. For example, feelings of alienation, powerlessness, fatalism\nand cynicism are likely to result from previous experiences of denial and exploi-\ntation that are potentially hazardous to health, as they may be correlated\nwith recognised pre-disease pathways in individuals such as stress (Thoits\nIn all, a common theme that emanates from these differently labelled\ntheories (i.e. culture-of-poverty perspective, contagion or epidemic model and\nsubcultural transmission model) is that community economic deprivation is\ncomplexly intertwined with social disorganisations and physical disorders;\nand, the combined social-structural distress nurtures deviant cultural char-\nacteristics that inevitably expose the inhabitants to health-detrimental\npsychosocial hazards which tend to precipitate the ageing process and to\ncause morbidity and premature mortality.\nHealth lifestyles and ecological `habitus'\nHealth lifestyles are important psychosocial factors that have been theorised\nand corroborated as important pathways linking social contexts with health\n(Williams 1990). Health lifestyles have been defined as collective modes of\nhealth-related consumption involving choices in diet, leisure, activity, health-\ncare use and other forms of behaviour, and are based on options available\nto people according to their life chances reflected in variables such as age,\ngender, race, ethnicity, social networks and SES (Cockerham and Ritchey\n1997). It has long been recognised that one's life chances, largely determined\n564 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nby one's structural position in the social hierarchy, shape the choices that\npeople can make (Weber 1978). The relationship between social class and\nhealth lifestyles in France has been thoroughly studied by the French\nsociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1984). According to Bourdieu, habitus, or a\nclass-based set of durable dispositions to act in particular ways, results from\nupstream social structure and shapes an individual's cultural tastes and styles\nso as to correspond to his or her social position. In the US, given the fact that\npoverty and affluence have been more and more concentrated spatially in\nlarge cities over the last three decades (Massey 1996), place of residence can\nbe viewed as an extended marker of one's structural position in society. Indeed,\nit can be argued that health lifestyles are spatially patterned and inextricably\nentangled with the spatial distribution of structural resources.\nAlthough research that empirically examines the link between the health\nsubculture of a residential community and the health of individual residents\nis extremely rare, some evidence shows that community collective features\nare important to individual health behaviours. For example, Yen and Kaplan\n(1998) found that area characteristics such as lighting, amount of criminal\nactivity and access to recreational facilities could influence physical activity\nlevels. In addition to Yen and Kaplan's (1999) finding that local poverty\nprospectively predicted decline in physical activity, a recent study (Craig et\nal. 2002) using Canadian data found that a composite score of community\nenvironment, based on 18 community characteristics (e.g. variety of destina-\ntions, visual aesthetics and traffic), was positively associated with walking\nto work, both with and without adjustment for degree of urbanisation. Another\nstudy, drawing on ecological theory, examined the association among partic-\nipation in regular vigorous exercise, social status and aspects of prominent\nlife settings, including contextual factors at the community level (Grzywacz\nand Marks 2001). These analyses indicated that respondents who perceived\ntheir neighbourhoods as safer participated in more regular and vigorous\nexercise than individuals in less safe communities. Other health behaviours\nhave also been examined in their relation to residential environment. Lee\nand Cubbin (2002) examined whether community characteristics were asso-\nciated with cardiovascular health behaviours independently of individual\ncharacteristics. The results showed that low SES and high community social\ndisorganisation were independently associated with poorer dietary habits,\nwhile high community Hispanic concentration and urbanicity were associ-\nated with healthier dietary habits. While this study did not show significant\nassociations between community characteristics and physical activity or\nsmoking, two other studies have found prominent effects of community SES\non smoking behaviours. One study found that deprivation of the area of\nresidence remained a significant predictor of smoking status even after the\nsocioeconomic group of the individual had been taken into account (Klein-\nschmidt et al. 1995). The other study found that the age- and gender-adjusted\nprevalence of smoking was higher in deprived urban areas and that the\nSES of residents could only partially explain this effect (Reijneveld 1998).\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 565\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nEvidence also shows that community deprivation, perhaps partially through\nexerting environmental stress, increases one's likelihood of drug use even\nafter controlling for individual socio-demographic characteristics (Boardman\nThese empirical studies demonstrate that individual health lifestyles are\nsurely affected by community social and structural characteristics, which\nmake it a plausible hypothesis that community subcultural orientation cor-\nresponds to social, economic and physical aspects of community environments,\nand influences individual choices of health promoting or compromising\nconsumption that eventually affect health. Even if we may suspect that\nhealthy or risky behaviours have a larger impact on the onset of disease than\non the outcome, it is reasonable to expect that lifestyles as manifest in diet,\nexercise, smoking, alcohol use and utilisation of preventive healthcare are\nstill important factors that would affect disease progression to death among\nseriously ill older adults.\nConceptual framework\nBased on these theoretical considerations and empirical findings, Figure 1\nshows a conceptual model that guides our empirical analyses. We focus on\nconcentrated poverty as a socioeconomic marker, collective efficacy as an\nindicator of health-promoting social resources and physical disorder as a\nmeasure of local physical environment. We examine two aspects of subcul-\ntural orientation \u00ad anomic attitudes and tolerance for risk behaviours \u00ad in\nterms of their impact on health and role in the pathway from community\ndistress to health. Health is objectively indexed by mortality after the onset\nof serious illness in older life. Acknowledging additional individual-level\nFigure 1 Conceptual model\n566 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\npathways linking place with health, this model postulates that concentrated\npoverty, low collective efficacy and physical disorder are bundled together\nconstituting community distress that fosters a sense of anomie and raises the\nlevel of tolerance for risky behaviour in the community which exacerbates\nalready existing medical conditions among seniors, accelerates the health\ndeteriorating process and increases mortality.\nMethods\nData\nThree data sources were used to construct the working sample in this study:\nNeighborhoods-Community Survey (PHDCN-CS), and the Care after the\nOnset of Serious Illness (COSI) dataset.\nZIP code level poverty rate was obtained from the 1990 Census and was\nused as a structural marker of community conditions. The benefit of using\na single variable versus a composite index to indicate community economic\ncondition is that it is conceptually clear and methodologically simple.\nMeasures of community physical environment (physical disorder), social\nresources (collective efficacy) and cultural characteristics (tolerance for risk\nbehaviour, anomie) were constructed from the PHDCN-CS (Sampson et al.\nChicago focusing on respondent assessments of the communities in which\nthey live. Each record in the PHDCN-CS data was identified by a Census\ntract in Chicago. Using geographic centroids of Census tracts, we linked\neach Census tract with its corresponding ZIP code area. On average, there\nwere 293 PHDCN-CS respondents per ZIP code.\nThe core data of COSI are rooted in the 1993 inpatient hospitalisation\nrecords from the Health Care Financing Administration's Medicare pro-\n2002). The COSI data set consists of a cohort of patients newly diagnosed\nin 1993 with one of 13 serious illnesses and followed for up to six years. The\n13 diseases were selected because they met several COSI conceptual criteria\nincluding accuracy of ascertainment and high prevalence. Prior detailed\nempirical work provided guidance to capture incident cases of disease based\non incident hospitalisations. Detailed descriptions of how COSI data were\nconstructed have been published elsewhere (Christakis et al. 2002).\nZIP codes were available for subjects in the COSI data and were used to\ndefine neighbourhoods and to link the three data sources into one\nmerged file. Although ZIP code boundaries do not perfectly circumscribe\nneighbourhoods, they do represent local residential areas and they are\nfrequently used in studies of neighbourhoods (Finch et al. 1999, Lipton and\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 567\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nGeo-coding to smaller levels of aggregation (e.g. Census tracts) was not\npossible because of data limitations.\nDependent variable\nOur health outcome was the relative hazard of death for COSI cohort mem-\nbers. The survival time was defined as the number of days from the date of\nthe index hospitalisation for the onset of his/her disease to death or to the\nIndependent variables\nAt the individual level: Individual demographic and baseline health measures\n(used as controls in the analyses) include age, gender, race (non-white or\nwhite), three continuous comorbidity scores based on healthcare use in the\nthree years prior to the index hospitalisation3, and a dichotomous indicator\nof Medicaid recipient at any point in 1993 as a proxy measure of individual\nincome status (poverty). Table 1 illustrates characteristics of COSI patients in\nChicago. The average age of this cohort is about 79 with 13 per cent of them\nreceiving Medicaid in 1993. The majority are white and 32 per cent are\nnon-white, most of whom are African Americans and Latinos. For the\nCOSI cohort, stroke (23%) and congestive heart failure (24%) are the most\ncommon conditions among the diseases studied.\nAt the community level: Following Browning and Cagney (2003), health-\nrelated subcultural orientations were captured with two scales, a measure of\ntolerance for youthful deviance and problem behaviours and a measure of\ndetachment from conventional norms (anomie). Tolerance for risk behaviour\nwas measured by four items. Respondents were asked their opinions regarding\nhow wrong it was for teenagers around 19 years old to smoke cigarettes, use\nmarijuana, drink alcohol and get into fistfights. Anomie was tapped by a\nfive-point Likert scale asking respondents' agreement with the following\nstatements: 1) `Laws were made to be broken', 2) `It's okay to do anything you\nwant as long as you don't hurt anyone', 3) `To make money, there are no right\nand wrong ways any more, only easy ways and hard ways', and 4) `Fighting\nbetween friends or within families is nobody else's business'. Corresponding\nto Durkheim's original conception of the concept of anomie (Durkheim\nnorms and fatalistic orientations that may increase the likelihood of health-\nFollowing the operationalisation of Sampson et al. (1997), the collective\nefficacy scale was constructed through combining items of social cohesion\nand informal social control. Social cohesion items from the PHDCN-CS\nassessed the respondent's level of agreement (on a five-point scale) with the\nfollowing statements: 1) `People around here are willing to help their neighbors',\n2) `This is a close-knit neighborhood', 3) `People in this community can be\ntrusted', 4) `People in this community generally don't get along with each\n568 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nother', and 5) `People in this community do not share the same values'. The\nlast two items were reverse coded. Health-related informal social control\nwas tapped through respondents' level of agreement with the following\nstatement: `You can count on adults in this community to watch out that\nchildren are safe and don't get into trouble'. An additional informal control\nitem asked respondents how likely it was that people in their community\nwould intervene if a fight broke out in front of their house. Social cohesion\nand informal social control were closely correlated across ZIP code areas\nthe more the stock of collective efficacy present in the community.\nPhysical disorder was represented by a three-item Likert-type scale in the\nPHDCN-CS. Residents were asked about the extent of problems stemming\nfrom litter, broken glass or trash on the sidewalks and streets; of graffiti on\nbuildings and walls; of vacant or deserted houses or shopfronts. Responses\nTable 1 Characteristics of COSI patients in Chicago\nVariables Mean/per cent St dev.\nDemographic\n* Baseline health status was measured by the Charlson scores for the first, the second and the\nthird year of lookback\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 569\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nto the items were aggregated to the community level as initial measures. The\nthree items were highly correlated across neighbourhoods. They were\nsubsequently combined into a composite measure, with higher scores indi-\ncating higher levels of physical disorder.\nCommunity Poverty was measured by the percentage of households that\nwere living in poverty (a household annual income of less than US$13,359\nfor a household of four in 1990). Community poverty, as a marker of\nspatially based social position, goes hand in hand with physical disorder\n(r = 0.81; p < 0.001) while being negatively correlated with collective efficacy\n(r = -0.68; p < 0.001). By contrast, the two cultural variables are not\nsignificantly associated with poverty. Relative to anomie, tolerance for risk\nbehaviour is more correlated with poverty although the correlation is not\nstatistically significant at the five per cent level (r = 0.21; p = 0.15). Mean-\nwhile, it is significantly linked to collective efficacy (r = -0.39; p < 0.05) and\nphysical disorder (p = 0.23; p < 0.10). Table 2 shows the correlation matrix\nof these five measures of community environment.\nTo better understand the relationships among these community factors, we\nperformed factor analyses to identify the latent structure underlying the five\nvariables at the community level examined in this study. These analyses show\nthat physical disorder, poverty and collective efficacy are tightly clustered\naround a dominant factor, whereas tolerance for risk behaviour and anomie\nappear conspicuously distinct. Factor loadings for poverty, collective efficacy\na single factor score as a composite measure of general community social, eco-\nnomic and physical environment. The community distress scale has a satisfactory\ninternal reliability (the coefficient alpha is 0.76). We label this composite\nmeasure as `community distress', which is positively correlated with high poverty,\nlow collective efficacy and high level of physical disorder in the community.\nAnalytical strategy\nFollowing the ecometric method assessing ecological settings illustrated in\nthe work of Raudenbush and Sampson (1999), we used HLM-adjusted\nTable 2 Correlation matrix of community-level characteristics\nPoverty\nCollective\nefficacy\nPhysical\ndisorder Anomie\nRisk\nbehaviour\nN = 51 Zip code areas\n570 Ming Wen and Nicholas A.

The major advantage\nof this approach to measuring community characteristics based on survey\ndata is that ecological measures thus constructed are simultaneously adjusted\nfor item-specific factors (e.g. severity), response bias, different sample size\nwithin each ecological unit and random errors specific to each community.\nAfter data construction, we fit a series of Cox proportional hazards\nmodels to test the effects of community characteristics on individual hazard\nof death among the elderly patients in the COSI data set. The Huber-White\nrobust method of calculating the variance-covariance matrix is used to\naccount for the possible correlation in survival experiences among patients\nliving within the same ZIP code area (Lin and Wei 1989). The proportionality\nassumption of Cox models was tested to examine the sensitivity of findings\nfrom non-stratified Cox models to the violation of the proportionality assumption.\nNo meaningful violation of the proportionality assumption was detected.\nResults\nTable 3 shows the results of six Cox proportional hazards models that examine\nthe effects of community distress, anomie and tolerance for risk behaviours\non mortality and the mediating role of subcultural orientation in the link\nbetween community distress and the hazards of death among elderly\npatients. First, we find that community physical, social and economic distress\nprospectively and contextually increases the mortality risk of individuals\nafter diagnosis (model 3.1). Living in a community with one unit higher level\nof distress is associated with four per cent higher risk of mortality after\nonset of serious disease in this elderly patient population, controlling for\nindividual poverty status, age, gender, race, baseline comorbidity and diagnosis.\nThe magnitude of this community effect can be understood more intuitively\nby comparison with the mortality effect of individual attributes. For exam-\nple, according to model 1 in Table 3, the difference in the relative hazard of\ndeath between two sub-populations which differ by one unit in community\ndistress is approximately equivalent to the difference that would be gener-\nated by a 10-month age difference at the individual level.\nSecond, a measure of anomie at the community level significantly predicts\nhigher rate of mortality for older patients with serious diseases in addition\nto several personal characteristics (model 3.2). Living in a community with\none unit higher level of anomie is associated with 26 per cent higher risk of\nmortality in this elderly patient population regardless of individual risk fac-\ntors. Tolerance for risk behaviour also exerts a positive effect on mortality\nbut the magnitude of the effect is not statistically significant (model 3.3).\nThird, the data also show that community distress can be partially explained\nby the contextual impact of anomie. After adding anomie to model 3.1, the\neffect of community distress decreases by about 18 per cent but remains\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 571\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nTable 3 Coefficients of Cox Proportional Hazards Models\nCommunity\ndistress\nAnomie\nRisk\nbehaviour\nDistress\n& anomie\nDistress\n& behaviour\nDistress\n& subculture\n572 Ming Wen and Nicholas A.

Similarly, adding commu-\nnity distress to model 3.2 reduces the anomie effect by nearly 20 per cent\nwhich is now only marginally significant at the 10 per cent level (model 3.4).\nFourth, both model 3.5 and model 3.6 show that tolerance of risky behav-\niours is not an important mechanism underlying the contextual effect of\ncommunity distress on mortality. The effect of community distress remains\nvirtually unchanged with tolerance of risky behaviours added to the model.\nIn summary, the key message conveyed by Table 3 is that the overall level\nof community economic, social and physical distress exercises a strong\nimpact of increasing the odds among older people of dying from medical\nconditions, and community subcultural orientation manifest in anomic\nattitudes seems to play a mediating role in this association. It is also note-\nworthy that the effects of individual risk factors are consistent across all\nthe models. Age, male gender, poverty and co-existing morbidity are all\nsignificant risk factors of mortality. The coefficients of diagnosis reveal that\nrelative to acute myocardial infarction (MI; the reference diagnosis), stroke\nhas a comparable effect on the hazard of death, congestive heart failure has a\nstronger mortality force, most cancers have yet stronger effects on mortality,\nand hip fracture appears to be the least fatal condition among the 13 diseases\nexamined.\nSummary and discussion\nIn this prospective and contextual study, we examined four dimensions of\ncommunity environments, comprising physical disorder, social resources,\neconomic deprivation and subcultural orientation in terms of their con-\ntextual effects on mortality risk following diagnosis with various serious\nconditions in an elderly population in Chicago. We found that a dominant\nlatent factor underlies physical disorder, collective efficacy and poverty. An\nencompassing composite index was then constructed to measure the level of\ncommunity distress and was subsequently used to test our conceptual model\n(see Figure 1). The theoretical framework received broad empirical support.\nThe conclusion that we can draw is that community distress and the\namount of anomie present in the community (a contextual subcultural\nfactor) exert powerful contextual forces affecting the mortality risk among\nelderly patients, in addition to individual risk factors. By contrast, we found\nno effect of the level of tolerance for risk behaviours on the mortality of\nelderly people stricken with debilitating illnesses. When we set off to test the\nmortality effect of subcultural orientation, we explicitly focused on deviant\nattitudes in general and views on risk behaviours in particular, as two\nimportant dimensions of community subculture. The anomie scale was\nintended to tap the first dimension and the tolerance for risk behaviour scale\nwas orientated to capturing the latter. Recall of the tolerance for risk behav-\niour scale was based on respondents' opinions regarding how wrong it was\n574 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nfor teenagers to engage in risk behaviours. It is possible that this measure is\nprimarily based on views about teenage risk behaviour and therefore is less\nrelevant for older and diseased adults. Or, perhaps more likely, norms of\nhealthy or risky behaviour at the community level have indeed a more\npreventive function and are less crucial for elderly people who have already\nbeen afflicted with serious diseases, even if at the individual level lifestyles\nmay still be relevant for health at this stage of life. On the other hand, the\nlevel of anomie, which may reflect a certain degree of cynicism, fatalism and\n`present-time-consumption' that spread across the community, appears to\nhave a strong impact on the hazard of death contextually as well as prospec-\ntively in this elderly population with serious illnesses.\nFollowing the findings of significant effects of community distress and\nsubculture, we further examined whether the effect of community distress\nwas mediated through subcultural orientation as measured by the level of\nanomie and the tolerance for risk behaviours in the community. Our data\nshow that the two types of community forces, social-structural distress and\nsubculture, are inter-related yet clearly distinct from each other. Although\ntheir effects on mortality can each be understood by the other to some\ndegree, they have unique or independent impacts on mortality which are\nperhaps channelled through alternative pathways. This finding confirms the\nhypothesis put forward in the conceptual model (Figure 1), that is, that\ncommunity social-economic-physical distress affects mortality in part via\nsubcultural orientation. However, additional mechanisms probably exist\nthrough other community ecological processes and/or individual pathways\nthat are not examined in this study.\nThe conclusion that community subcultural orientation plays a significant\nrole in the link between residential community distress and health may be\nprovocative. This evidence essentially lends support to the culture-of-poverty\nperspective that stresses the unhealthy subcultures in marginalised social\ngroups and poor urban communities in explaining the so-called `ghetto'\nproblems, as well as individual disadvantage. Critics of the culture-of-\npoverty thesis argue that it places blame on the victim no matter whether at\nthe individual level or community level and hence clouds the social causes\nof poverty; believers in this view may therefore erroneously favour social\npolicies that aim to indoctrinate the poor with mainstream values over those\nmore expensive and painful policies that promote structural changes in\nresource allocation (Steinberg 1989). Clearly, it is not appropriate to assume\nthat cultural patterns spontaneously evolve without being inextricably\ntied up with the social structure. As Oscar Lewis noted in his original con-\nception of the culture-of-poverty perspective, `by creating basic structural\nchanges in society, by redistributing wealth, by organizing the poor and\ngiving them a sense of belonging, of power and of leadership, revolutions\nfrequently succeed in abolishing some of the basic characteristics of the\nculture of poverty even when they do not succeed in curing poverty itself'\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 575\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nOn the other hand, as argued long ago by Ulf Hannerz (1969) and reiter-\nated by William Julius Wilson (1991), it is not enough to recognise the\nimportance of macrostructural constraints; it is also imperative to see `the\nmerits of a more subtle kind of cultural analysis of life in poverty' (Hannerz\n`culture versus social structure' have impeded the development of a broader\ntheoretical context that can be used to examine questions regarding life\nin urban deprived neighbourhoods. He also presented a framework that\nintegrates social structural and cultural arguments in an attempt to depict\nthe sources as well as processes of social dislocations in inner-city ghettos.\nThis framework finds some empirical support in the current research, show-\ning that community subcultural orientation (i.e. anomie) does play a role in\nlinking poor neighbourhoods with poor health.\nIt is equally important, however, to recognise that although poor places\ntend to have health-compromising subcultures and social problems, not all\npoor places have become `ghettos' (Wilson 1971), and some communities,\ndespite suffering from economic deficiency, may yet manage well in\nmaintaining the mainstream values or social functioning, and, in doing so,\nalleviate the deleterious effect of structural disadvantage. These communities\nare probably uncommon, but their experiences would be particularly informative\nto policy makers and researchers who are concerned with health disparities\nacross social groups. Further quantitative and qualitative research is needed\nto elucidate the processes through which some impoverished communities\nprotect their residents against health hazards better than their peers of similar\npoverty level. Data from in-depth ethnographic field work may provide some\nanswers to questions such as `What are the circumstances, apart from or\nin conjunction with affluence, that impel a community to mobilise an\nefficient apparatus to instill positive cultural values into the residents and\nsuccessfully maintain social order?'. Such research would potentially narrow\nthe knowledge gap in the relationship between community subcultural\norientation and the residents'physical and mental health. Some cultural orientations\nare not exclusively rooted in the unequal distribution of resources. Future work\nshould extend research by investigating other cultural aspects in the commu-\nnity, such as health values and attitudes toward health services, that may be\nembedded in the community's ethnic and minority background.\nIn sum, the general findings from this research are strongly supportive of\nthe perspective that community contextual effects extend to later life. Theory\nsuggests that community effect should be stronger for elderly people because\nthey tend to be less mobile, spend more time in the neighbourhood and be\nmore vulnerable and/or attached to their neighbourhoods than younger people\nat most mixed about this posited age pattern in the neighbourhood-health\nlink, with more studies in fact finding non-significant or less significant\ncommunity effect (SES) among elderly adults (Anderson et al. 1997, Haan\n576 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nmeasures of community environment may be one reason for the seemingly\nreduced community effects in older persons (Glass and Balfour 2003). Using\nmultiple measures of the community environment, our study reinforces the\nidea that the social, economic, physical and cultural environments of\nresidential community are relevant dimensions of social causation of mortality\nin later life.\nHere it is noteworthy that our measures of anomie and tolerance for risk\nbehaviour are aggregated survey-based assessments of individual attitudes\nand are rather exploratory. To efficiently identify anomie in the community,\nwe focused on the key dimension of the anomie concept \u00ad values and attitudes\ndeviant from the dominant culture. In fact, this component of anomie,\nperhaps most closely approximating Durkheim's original conception of\nanomie, is also reflected in the item standing for the deflation of internalised\nsocial norms and values in the original Srole anomia scale (Srole 1956).\nWhile we did not adopt the Srole anomia scale to operationalise the anomie\nconcept, two items in the anomia scale might be incorporated into our\nanomie scale in the future as a measure of detachment from conventional\nnorms. One item captures the sense of orderlessness, with the agree-disagree\nstatement `Nowadays a person has to live pretty much for today and let\ntomorrow take care of itself'. The other item directly taps normlessness and\nmeaninglessness, with the statement `It's hardly fair to bring children into\nthe world with the way things look for the future'. There are certainly other\nattitudinal statements that are potentially useful for constructing a differen-\ntiating measure of anomie. It is hoped that in future research more effective\nmeasurement of anomie will be conceived, constructed and validated\nthrough concerted qualitative and quantitative efforts in formulating the\napplications of the anomie concept. More work also needs to be done to\nrefine the measurement of tolerance for risk behaviours at the community\nlevel. Situational measures that are more relevant to our study population \u00ad\nolder adults with serious illness \u00ad may yield different findings.\nSeveral strengths of this study merit comment. Using different data sources\nto measure community environment (i.e. the 1990 Census data and the\nPHDCN-CS) and to capture individual risk factors and health event (the\nCOSI) minimises method-induced associations between outcomes and\npredictors. Our outcome measure, the hazard of death, was objective. The study\nwas prospective and population-based. Moreover, we tested the prospective and\ncontextual effect of an under-researched aspect of community life \u00ad subcul-\ntural orientation \u00ad on mortality following serious illnesses in the late stage of the\nlifecourse, and further revealed the mediating role of cultural characteristics\n(i.e. anomie) in the link between community physical, social and economic\ndisadvantage and the hazard of death among elderly urban patients.\nThe research would be strengthened by a true longitudinal design, however.\nWithout time-varying information on individual residence (only ZIP code at\nthe origin of the study was available for the COSI cohort) we cannot examine\nhow residential mobility affects our findings. Presumably, some people moved\nCommunity, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 577\n\u00a9 2006 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nbetween their initial diagnosis and their death. Failure to take this issue into\naccount may result in bias due to exposure misspecification. The direction\nof this bias is not clear, however, because of variation in the possible causes\nof residential moves. Future investigation equipped with longitudinal data\nboth at the individual level and community level should be able to better explore\nthis issue. Another data limitation concerns the lack of individual-level con-\ntrols. For example, we did not control for education which is clearly related\nto one's residence as well as health, and our measure for individual income\nwas crude and only based on a dichotomous indicator of Medicaid recipient.\nNevertheless, we controlled for diagnosis in 1993 at the index of hospitalisa-\ntion and comorbidity status for the three preceding years. It is arguable that\nthese health outcomes are largely reflective of one's social-demographic back-\nground and can be viewed as complementary to other individual-level risk factors.\nFinally, we want to mention that this study is Chicago-based and designed\nfor a vulnerable subgroup of the population \u00ad people who are old and\nill. It would be interesting to see if the main findings are replicable for other\npopulations in other urban or rural settings. Our knowledge of social deter-\nminants of health would be further enhanced by finding specific patterns\nof community effects for different subgroups on a variety of health outcomes.\nIn conclusion, this research finds evidence supporting the prospective and\ncontextual effect of the social, economic, physical and cultural environment\nof local communities on the survival experiences of older people facing life\nthreatening illness. It appears that reducing poverty, regaining community\ncollective efficacy, controlling physical disorder and redirecting subcultural\norientation via, say, providing role models and adequate institutional\nsupport, may help regenerate disadvantaged neighbourhoods and benefit the\nhealth of local residents.\nAddress for correspondence: Ming Wen, Department of Sociology, University\ne-mail: ming.wen@soc.utah.edu\n"
