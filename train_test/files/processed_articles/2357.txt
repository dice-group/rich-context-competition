Mostinvestigatorswho\npioneered drug testing in meconium used radioimmunoassay\n(RIA)as the initial screening method (1-5) with fewerapplica-\ntions offluorescence-polarizationimmunoassay (FPIA)and gas\nchromatography-massspectrometry (GC--MS)(6).\nDeterminationofprenatal exposuretodrugs through testingof\nmeconium is important becausepregnant women under-report\ndrug use (5).In a large-scale,prospective,epidemioiogicstudy,\nOstrea et al. (7) examined meconium specimens from infants\nbornto3010mothers ina high-riskurbanpopulationforcocaine,\nopiates,and marijuana.Forty-fourpercentofthe specimenswere\npositivefor one or more of the three drugclasses.Ofthese, 31%\nwere positive for cocaine, 21% for morphine, and 12% for\ncannabinoids. However,only 11% of the mothers admitted to\nillicitdruguse.It mustbe emphasizedthatthis degreeofpositives\nwas basedon RIAscreening ofdiluted meconiumonly.It should\nalsobe notedthat most ofthe workreportedin the earlier litera-\nture wasbasedon immunoassayanalysisand was not confirmed\nbyother methodssuch as GC-MS.\nIn 1992,the National Institute of ChildHealth and Human\nDevelopment(NICHD)and theNationalInstitute onDrugAbuse\n(NIDA)issued a contract to developandvalidate screening and\nGC-MSconfirmationmethods for the analysisofdrugs ofabuse\nin meconium specimensat levelsfar belowthe commonlyused\ncutofflevelsin the commercialurine drug-testingfield.Specific\nanalytes required for this studywere 11-nor-A9-THC-9-COOH\n(THCCOOH)(forcannabinoids);benzoylecgonine,cocaine,and\ncocaethylene (forcocaine); morphine, codeine, 6-monoacetyl-\nmorphine, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone (for opiates);\namphetamine and methamphetamine (foramphetamines); and\nphencyclidine(PCP).The resultsof the developmentand valida-\ntion studiesweresummarizedinJanuaryof1993ina report sub-\nmitted to NICHD(8),and the methods were subsequentlyused\nforthe analysisofmeconium specimenssubmittedbythe partic-\nipatingsitesofthe \"MaternalLifestyleStudy\", specifically,Brown\nUniversity, University of Miami, University of Tennessee at\nMemphis,and WayneState University.This manuscript reports\non the analyticalmethods developedforthese studiesduring the\nlatterpartof1992.Theliteraturewasscanton analyticalmethods\nat the time,particularlyfor the broad rangeofcompoundsinves-\ntigated in this study.

Other meconiumspecimens were\nobtained, with the consent of the mothers, from the four sites\nparticipating in the NICHD Maternal Lifestyle Study: Brown\nUniversity,Universityof Miami, Wayne State University,and the\nUniversityofTennessee. Blank meconiumpoolswereanalyzed by\nboth screening and GC-MS procedures at limit of detection\n(LOD)levelsprior to use.\nForbest results, a minimum of0.5 g meconiumwas neededto\nscreenforall fivedrug classesand I g to confirmfor eachpositive\nby GC-MS.Smaller amounts could be used, but a dilution factor\nthat would lowerthe sensitivity ofthe assayswould be required.\nEquipment\nScreening equipment consisted of the EMIT-ETS analyzer\n(SyvaCorp., now Dade-Behring, Palo Alto, CA) and the Abbott\nTDxsystem (AbbottLaboratories, Chicago,IL).Asonic disrupter,\nmodel TSD-600 with a 1/8-in. microtip and sound enclosure\n(Tekmar-Dohrmann, Cincinnati, OH), was used for disrupting\nmeconium with extraction solvents. A centrifugal vacuum con-\ncentrator (model RC-10.10,system 3) equippedwith an ultra-low\nL/rain) (Jouan, Inc.,Winchester, VA)wasused forthe evaporation\nofthe extraction solvents ofmeconium specimens.\nGC-MS equipment consisted of a Hewlett-Packard 5890 GC\nTheGC-MSwastuned daily,and the dwelltime used forall ions\nmonitored in the SIM mode was 50 ms.

The method used\nforspecimen extraction and preparation usingthe EMIT-ETSTM\nat\nlowcutofflevels(SchemeI) is described.\nIn a prelabeled and preweighed 16 x 100-mm glass test tube,\nsufficient meconium was transferred to weigh I g (_+0.02 g),\nkeeping the walls ofthe tube as clean as possible and the meco-\nnium as close to the bottom of the tube as possible. The tubes\nwere briefly centrifuged in order to force the meconium to the\nbottom of the tube. Each sample was homogenized with 3 mL\nmethanol using a sonic disrupter and immersing the microtip\napproximately 5 mm below the surface of the methanol. Dis-\nruption wasperformedfora 30-s cycleat 80% pulsingand a max-\nimum microtip power setting of 5. The cycle was repeated as\nnecessary, making sure that all meconium had been thoroughly\ndisrupted. The microtip was cleaned with methanol between\ntubes to prevent cross-contamination.When all ofthe tubes had\nfor 10 min. Two milliliters of the clear supernatant methanolic\nsolutionwas transferredto a clean 12x 75-mm glasstube labeled\nwith the same specimen number.

The centrifugal\nvacuum concentrator was operated at room temperature for at\nleast 30 min before increasing the temperature to 40~ After\ncompletely drying, the tubes were removed from the concen-\ntrator and 0.67 mL of methanol were added to each tube, vortex\nmixed, and sonicated (water sonicator or sonic disrupter), and\nthen centrifuged for 5 min.

In addi-\ntion, development and validation of GC-MS confirmation\nmethods for the different drugs or metabolites was an integral\npart ofthis effort.\nAlthough a few publications appeared in the literature at the\ntime this work was completed,they mainly focusedon the anal-\nDevelopment of a samplepreparationmethodforscreening\nSeveral methods were examined for the extraction of meco-\nnium specimens spiked with the fivedrug metabolite classes.\nManyof these methods provedto be inefficient,inconsistent, or\nfraught withproblemsthat rendered them uselessfor meconium\nextraction.\nExtraction with buffersolution. A relatively large volume of\nbuffer was found to be needed for extraction which has the\ninherent problem of sample dilution and, therefore, reduced\nassaysensitivity.\nExtraction with methanol followedby evaporation of the\nmethanol extract and reconstitution of the residue in the\nscreeningassaybufferpriorto analysis.Although the methanol\nextraction proved to be efficient, the methanol extract was\nextremelydifficultto reconstitute in the buffermaking it impos-\nsible to bring the final concentration to the equivalent of I g\nmeconium per I mL of final solution. The final solution was\nopaque in many cases, even after centfifugation, which resulted\nin maximum background signals on the TDx (FPIA)assay and\ninvalidresults on the EMIT-ETSsystem(EIA).Furtherdilution of\nthe extract was necessaryto avoidthis problem. Dilution of the\nfinal extract reduced assaysensitivity.In addition, especiallyfor\nTHCCOOH,verylowrecovery(< 20%)wasobserved.\nExtraction with methanolcontaining5% DMSOfollowedby\nevaporation of the methanol and reconstitution ofthe DMSO\nsolutionoftheextractin theassailbuffer.The addition ofDMSO\nto methanolwasdesignedto keepthe drugsin solutionwhilethe\nmethanolwasbeing evaporated.Althoughthis technique seemed\nto improvethe recoveryofTHCCOOH,the colorofthe finalsolu-\ntion was still too dark to analyzeby either TDxor EMITwithout\nfurther dilution.\nExtraction with methanolfollowedby evaporationofthe sol-\nventanddirectreconstitution ofthe residuein a 1:1mixture of\nmethanolandassaybuff~ This method providedbetter overall\nrecoveryof all the drugs. However,dilution ofthe final solution\nwithat leastan equalvolumeofrnethanol/buffer(1:1)wasneces-\nsary.For the EMITsystem,this dilution levelwasadequate forall\nassays to obtain satisfactory results without any incident of\ninvalidresults. However,for the TDx,dilution of the solution of\nthe extract with two volumes of the methanol/buffer (1:1)was\nnecessary for the amphetamines, cannabinoids, and phencycli-\ndine assays.\nIn addition, several methods were evaluated for carrying out\nthe extraction with different solvents. These included shaking,\nvortexmixing,sonicating (low-powerwater sonicator),and sonic\ndisruption. Sonic disruption was found to providethe most con-\nsistent mixingofmeconiumwith the extractionsolvent.\nSubsequent to the evaluationofthese methodsand in an effort\nto providea finalsolution ofthe extract that wouldbe equivalent\nto I g meconiumper I mL final solution, an extraction method\nwas devised which was modeled after the GC-MS extraction\nmethod. The acidic and basic fractions followinga partitioning\nscheme of a crude methanol extract were prepared where THC-\nCOOHwasanalyzedin the acidicfraction and all other four drug\nclasses in the basicfraction. Although this procedure produced\nrelativelyclean extracts and adequate sensitivity,the procedure\nwastoo elaboratefora screening method.\nThe finalextraction methodwas the result ofcareful observa-\ntion of the behavior of the methanolic extracts in the previous\ntrials. It was noticed during the evaporation of the methanol\nextract of meconiumthat, in some cases, a precipitate appears\nearly in the evaporation process; this precipitate went back in\nsolution as the extract became more concentrated. The implica-\ntions were that the precipitated material might not be very sol-\nuble in methanol but soluble in water. Therefore, as more\nmethanol evaporated and the concentration ofwater increased,\nthe residue became more soluble.Asa result ofthis observation,\n1 g rneconium was extracted with methanol, the extract was\nevaporated to dryness, and the residue was sonicated in 1 mL\nmethanol. Centrifugation of the final solution provideda clear,\nlightbrownliquidthat appearedto beofmuch lowercolorinten-\nsitythananyofthe direct extractspreviouslyprepared.Fromthis\nsolution, 0.5mLwaswithdrawn, the solventwasevaporated,and\nthe residue was reconstituted in 250 laLmethanol followedby\n250 pL assaybuffer.Analysisofthis material on both EMIT-ETS\n(d.a.u.) and TDx (FPIA)showed no invalidresults or maximum\nbackground, respectively. Therefore, it was decided that this\nextraction procedure be validatedfor preparation of meconiurn\nextracts for screening purposes. The procedure is outlined in\nScheme I. It was noticed throughout this study that unless the\nextracts were diluted to the extent of 1 g to 2 mL or more, the\nTDxassaygavefrequent invalidresults due to maximumback-\ngroundforTHC,amphetamines, and PCRTherefore,forthe pur-\npose of this report, only the data for the EMIT(d.a.u.)assayare\npresented.\nTableIshowsthe results ofthe calibrationcurveson the EMIT-\nETS (d.a.u.) system.

Similar data were acquired for the TDx\nassay.\nThe cross-reactivity data for the four cannabi-\nnoids generally demonstrated almost equal or\nbetter cross-reactivitytoTHCCOOHatthe 10-and\n20-ng/mL levels. Therefore, these metabolites\ncould be major contributors to the overall\nimmunoassay response.\nDetermination of intra-assayprecision. Four-\nteen 1-g meconiumsamples from a blank batch\nwere extractedand analyzedbyEMIT-ETS(d.a.u.)\naccording to the procedure outlined under\nScheme Iforthe fivedrugclassesto determine the\nintra-assay precision for each drug.

Therefore, each sample was made\nto contain 30 ng/g each of PCP and THCCOOH\nand 300 ng/g each ofbenzoylecgonine,morphine,\nand amphetamine.

Therefore,at an assaysensitivityof 10\nng/mL, the effectiveassaysensitivityfor meconiumwould be 50\nng/g. Methanol was also used in extraction of meconiumspeci-\nmensin a mixturewith phosphate buffer(20%methanolin 0.1M\nbuffer, pH 6.4-6.8) followed by immunoassay analysis of the\nextract (17).Thesensitivityreported forthe analysisofmorphine,\nng/mL,respectively.Becausethe amountofmeconiumextracted\nwas0.2--0.5gand thevolume ofmethanol-bufferused forextrac-\ntion was 2-5 mL (a dilution factor of 10),the effectiveassaysen-\nrespectively.The procedure developedunder this investigation\nprovides a final solution (extract) equivalent to 1 mL/g meco-\nnium; therefore, no dilution factor is involved.\nAlthough the assaysensitivitywas far belowthe cutoffvalues\nusedin this study,the cutofflevelswereselectedto offerimproved\nsensitivitywhileminimizingthe numberofunconfirmedpositives.\nGC--MSprocedures were also developedand validatedto con-\nfirmthe immunoassaypresumptivepositives.For GC-MSconfir-\nTableVII.
