Although violence risk factors are considered to be commensurate across gender, a\ngrowing body of international literature is categorizing gender-specific criminal trajectories. The study aimed to investigate\nthis concept in an Australian juvenile context. Through the use of a widely validated youth violence risk assessment inventory,\nthe prevalence of salient risk items was compared across gender. Young female offenders were found to present with higher\nlevels of family dysfunction, peer rejection and self-injurious behavior reflecting international female offending pathways\nliterature.\n",

Thus, identi-\nfying key risk factors that are important for predicting recidi-\nvism and developing risk management and treatment\nstrategies in youths is critical.\nA body of research indicates that core risk factors for vio-\nlence are commensurate across gender (Hare, 1991; Hubbard\n1999). However, proponents of gender-specific risk/needs lit-\nerature propose that pertinent unique experiences play an\nimportant role in the development of female criminal trajecto-\nries (Blanchette & Brown, 2006; Bloom, Owen, & Covington,\nVan Voorhis, Salisbury, Wright, & Bauman, 2008; Van\nVoorhis, Wright, Salisbury, & Bauman, 2010). Feminist\ntheories of female criminality comprise contexts of familial\nand domestic abuse, characterized by victimization and dys-\nfunctional relationships (Blum, Ireland, & Blum, 2003;\nGavazzi, Yarcheck, & Chesney-Lind, 2006; Hubbard & Pratt,\nVoorhis et al., 2010). The ensuing traumas are connected to\ntruancy, substance abuse, economically motivated delin-\nquency, mental illness, self-injurious behavior, prostitution,\nand further victimization (Chesney-Lind, 1997; Gavazzi et\nWasserman & McReynolds, 2011). Reports indicate the high\nrates of mental illness among female offenders compared\nwith their nonoffending female counterparts and male offend-\ners (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW],\nal., 2008). Female offenders are also more likely to report\nabusive histories and attempt suicide compared with male\nNelson, 2008). Furthermore, illicit drug use among female\noffenders is also found to be consistently higher than male\noffenders and linked to poorer outcomes (Forsythe & Adams,\nWasserman, 2010). Moreover, there is evidence that the base\nrate of psychopathy in females is much lower than in males\n(Cale & Lilienfeld, 2002; Nicholls, Ogloff, Brink, & Spidel,\n1Monash University, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia\n2Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nStephane M.

Shepherd1, Stefan Luebbers1,2\nand Mairead Dolan1,2\n Keywords\ngender, risk assessment, juvenile, violence, recidivism\n2 SAGE Open\nthere are gender differences across items (Bolt, Hare, Vitale,\nBelfrage, 2005). Feminist writers argue that current risk\nassessment instruments may overlook such pathways that\ncould ultimately result in misclassifying female offenders\n& Blanchette, 2009). The omission of crucial gender-specific\nfactors for delinquency could also have repercussions for\ntreatment strategies that require an understanding of the etio-\nlogical issues that prompt female criminality.\nThere is a paucity of research exploring gender differ-\nences on adolescent risk inventories. Given that current offi-\ncial data indicate that young female contact with justice\nsystems appear to be increasing in Australia (AIC, 2011;\n(Puzzanchera & Adams, 2011; Puzzanchera, Adams, &\nthe United Kingdom (Ministry of Justice [MOJ], 2009), there\nis a need to examine the utility of youth inventories across\ngender to ensure the relevant dynamics are identified for\ntreatment targets and interventions.\nThe Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth\n(SAVRY, see appendix), a violence risk assessment inven-\ntory has been shown to predict violent recidivism for young\nfemales across custodial settings (Gammelg\u00e5rd, Koivisto,\nEronen, & Kaltiala-Heino, 2008; Lodewijks, de Ruiter, &\nthis study, the risk item scores of the SAVRY, which cover\nHistorical, Social/Contextual, and Individual/Clinical fac-\ntors, will be equated and paralleled across gender.\nWe anticipate comparable SAVRY total scores between\nmale and female offenders though predict potential differ-\nences on domain and individual item scores pertaining to\nfamilial and social relationships, mental health, self-harm,\nand substance abuse in accordance with the literature on gen-\nder-specific risk factors for violence.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 215 male and female youth were recruited from the\nYouth Justice Centres in Victoria, Australia: Parkville Youth\nJustice Precinct (PYJP) and Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre\n(MYJC). PYJP accommodates young men and women aged\n10 to 17 years who have been remanded or sentenced by a\nVictorian court, and young women 18 to 20 years who have\nbeen sentenced by a Victorian Court. MYJC accommodates\nyoung men aged 18 to 20 years who have been sentenced by\na Victorian Court. Two young people were excluded due to\nincomplete SAVRY data. The final total sample comprised\nticipants across gender is representative of Australian youth\noffender facilities where females consist on average 10% of\nprisoners (Richards & Lyneham, 2010). The mean age of the\np = .102). The index offenses of participants were Assault\nDamage (7%). For males, the top three index offenses com-\nprised Assault (37%), Robbery (16%), and Burglary/Theft\n(12%). For females, the top three were Burglary/Theft (38%),\nAssault (23%), and Robbery (23%). Approximately half the\nsample had previously been sentenced to custodial or com-\nmunity orders (48%) with male offenders having a similar\nsample included English-speaking background (48%), cul-\nturally and linguistically diverse (32%), and indigenous\n(20%). English-speaking background participants repre-\nsented the Anglo-Saxon/Caucasian majority. Culturally and\nlinguistically diverse participants included minorities from\nnon-English-speaking backgrounds (e.g., Lebanese, Pacific\nIslander, and African). The indigenous ethnic group included\nparticipants with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander heritage.\nMeasures\nThe SAVRY is a risk inventory that adopts a Structured\nProfessional Judgment (SPJ) paradigm. It was designed to\npredict violent behavior in youths 12 to 18 years old (Borum,\nBartel, & Forth, 2003) and comprises 24 risk markers divided\ninto three subscales assessing Historical, Social/Contextual,\nand Individual domains (see appendix). The Historical\ndomain includes static items focusing on prior behaviors and\nexperiences. The Social/Contextual domain considers\ndynamic factors relating to peer relationships and commu-\nnity influences while the Individual domain assesses psycho-\nlogical patterns and behaviors (Borum et al., 2003). The\nsubscales are summed to generate a total risk score. As there\nare no assigned cutoff scores, a professional arbitration\ncalled the \"SAVRY risk rating\" is proposed after considering\nall SAVRY factors. The instrument also contains six addi-\ntional protective factors that have been shown to mitigate the\nrisk of recidivism (Lodewijks, de Ruiter, & Doreleijers,\nfemales, 11 males) cases assessed independently by two\ntrained raters. The intraclass correlations (ICCs; single mea-\nsure) suggested very high concordance--SAVRY total score:\nHistorical domain: ICC = .96 ( = .98), Social/Contextual\ndomain: ICC = .90 ( = .95), Individual/Clinical domain:\nICC = .94 ( = .97), and Protective Factors domain: ICC =\n.96 ( = .98)--supporting the reliability of the SAVRY in the\npresent sample.\nShepherd et al. 3\nProcedures\nThe study was approved by the Victorian Department of\nHuman Services and the Monash University Human\nResearch Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was\nobtained from all participants. Consent for participants under\n18 years of age fell within the \"mature minor\" concept as\ndescribed in local Victorian legislation where mental compe-\ntency is determined by the ability of an underage participant\nto understand or appreciate points pertaining to their partak-\ning in and the nature of the study.\nParticipants were interviewed individually in a private\nroom allocated by youth justice custodial centre staff.\nSAVRY coding was completed using information from inter-\nviews and youth justice file material and was conducted by\nmaster-level researchers who had completed a SAVRY train-\ning course.\nData Handling and Analysis\nData were analyzed using SPSS Version 18. Due to unequal\nsample sizes, group differences in mean scores on the\nSAVRY domains were examined using a Mann\u00adWhitney\nU test. Chi-square analysis was used to examine group dif-\nferences on individual SAVRY items. Item scores were\ndichotomized.Arisk rating of \"high\" denoted higher risk and\na rating of \"medium/low\" combined represented lower risk.\nChapman, Desai, Falzer, and Borum (2006) had previously\nemployed a dichotomy of \"high/medium\" and \"low\" risk. In\nthis study, we employed a \"high\" separation as we believe it\nenabled a clearer identification of participants who strongly\npresented as high risk on a particular factor.\nResults\nGender Differences in SAVRY\nDomain Scores and Overall Risk Rating\nTable 1 shows the means, standard deviations, and U-test\nscores for male and female clients. Overall, approximately\n50% of the sample was rated as high risk on the SAVRY risk\nrating. Both groups had high proportions of their respective\ntotals in the high-risk rating category as shown in Figure 1.\nThe female group had a marginally higher SAVRY total\nscore than the males but this did not reach significance.\nFemales had significantly higher mean scores compared with\nmales on the Historical and Social/Contextual domains.\nGender Differences on SAVRY Individual Items\nTable 2 shows the proportions across gender who received a\nhigh score on individual SAVRY items. Both genders had\nlarge proportions of high ratings on items \"History of vio-\nlence,\" \"History of nonviolent offending,\" \"Peer delin-\nquency,\" \"Substance abuse difficulties,\" and \"Anger\nmanagement problems.\" Comparing genders, female youth\nwere significantly more likely than male youth to score\nhighly on items \"History of self-harm/suicide attempts,\"\nTable 1.

Male and female youths had sim-\nilar SAVRY total scores and high portions of their respective\nsamples receiving a high-risk rating. However, there are a\nnumber of significant differences across gender at the domain\nand item levels.\nThe mean overall SAVRY score (M = 26.66) of this sam-\nple was higher than previous North American and European\nstudies, which have ranged between 18 and 24 (Dolan &\nSpice, Viljoen, Gretton, & Roesch, 2010; Vincent, Chapman,\n& Cook, 2011; Welsh, Schmidt, McKinnon, Chattha, &\nMeyers, 2008). It is possible that the comparatively high-risk\nscores in our sample reflect jurisdictional differences in\nyouth diversionary policies, as only the most severe cases\nreceive a custodial sentence inVictoria,Australia (Sentencing\nAdvisory Council [SAC], 2012). Similarly, female criminal\nmisconduct in Australia and particularly Victoria is more\nlikely to result in community-based penalties compared with\nour custodial sample may represent more high-risk female\noffenders than would be found in other jurisdictions and may\nmask gender differences in our sample. This may account for\nTable 2.

SAVRY = Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth.\nShepherd et al. 5\nthe higher female SAVRY total scores (M = 28.82) found in\nthe present study compared with total scores for institution-\nalized female youth found by Gammelg\u00e5rd et al. (2008) and\nOur study found no significant difference between female\nand male youth on SAVRY total scores or summary risk rat-\nings. The findings were similar to other SAVRY studies\ncomparing gender (Lodewijks et al., 2008; Penney et al.,\nstudies using the Youth Level of Service/Case Management\nInventory (YLS/CMI), a general adolescent risk instrument\ndesigned to address criminogenic needs (Hoge & Andrews,\n2006), have found comparable total scores across gender\npresented with significantly higher total scores and risk rat-\nings compared with females on the SAVRY (Gammelg\u00e5rd et\nal., 2008; Gammelg\u00e5rd, Weizmann-Henelius, Koivisto,\nEronen, & Kaltiala-Heino, 2012) and theYLS/CMI (Onifade\net al., 2008). In addition, an Australian study by Thompson\nand McGrath (2011), albeit in another jurisdiction, found\nfemale youth involved with the New South Wales (NSW)\njuvenile justice system had significantly higher general\nrecidivism risk scores compared with their male counter-\nparts. The inconsistencies between genders on total risk\nscores may reflect the differences in correctional samples\nthat originate from jurisdictional variations in justice guide-\nlines. Alternatively, these inconsistencies raise questions\nabout the utility of total risk scores when considering gender\ndifferences in propensity for violence and the need to con-\nsider domain or specific factors.\nDomains\nFew studies have addressed differences in domain scores\nacross gender. This study found significant gender differ-\nences on the Historical and Social/Contextual domains of\nthe SAVRY where females presented with higher mean\nscores than males. This suggests that the adverse life expe-\nriences and the current criminogenic social circumstances\nof the females in this sample were more severe than their\nmale counterparts. Previous studies exploring gender dif-\nferences across SAVRY domains have produced inconsis-\ntent findings. Two studies found no significant gender\ndifferences across domains (Gammelg\u00e5rd et al., 2008;\nMeyers & Schmidt, 2008), conversely one study found\nmales had significantly higher scores than females on the\nIndividual/Contextual domain (Penney et al., 2010). Studies\nlooking at gender differences in the YLS/CMI domains\nhave also had inconsistent findings with some reporting no\ngender differences (Jung & Rawana, 1999; Schmidt et al.,\n2005), though others report gender differences in at least\nLooking at protective factors, the domain mean totals of\nthe present study were in line with previous SAVRY studies\n2011) and no significant domain differences were discovered\nacross gender. The quantity of protective factors displayed\nappears similar across gender, though there were discrepan-\ncies in individual factor occurrence. As the literature on gen-\nder differences across domain totals is meager and\ninconsistent, an examination of gender differentiation on the\nindividual items contributing to the domain scores is of more\nbenefit.\nIndividual Items\nAt the individual item level, both genders had over half\ntheir respective cohorts receiving a high-risk rating on a\nnumber of items. Although a history of violent and nonvio-\nlent offending was common (>70%) in males and females,\nrates did not significantly differ. Previous SAVRY research\nhas found strong correlations between the Historical\ndomain, which contains these items, and future violent\nrecidivism for male and female youth in custody (Dolan &\n2010). In addition, studies on the YLS/CMI suggest that\nthe \"Criminal history\" item predicts future recidivism\nacross gender. Previous offending is known to be a signifi-\ncant predictor of future recidivism (Farrington, 1995;\nFarrington & Loeber, 2000; Lynch, Buckman, & Krenske,\nmarker across the genders. The lack of gender differences\nin rates of prior offending in this study may reflect data\nsuggesting that adolescent female offending is increasing\nmore steadily than male offending. Research suggests that\nincreases in rates of female violence are more the result of\nnet-widening risk management policy shifts resulting in a\ngreater number of females being processed as offenders\nrather than cogent changes in female behavior (Carrington,\nZhong, & Ackerman, 2005). Nonetheless, in a severe sam-\nple of chronic male and female youth offenders, it is likely\nthat both groups would share similar problematic criminal\nhistories.\nThe item \"Peer delinquency\" was similarly prevalent\n(>65%) in our cohort. This is consistent with research show-\ning that youth gang membership is often a precursor to anti-\nsocial behavior (Battin, Hill, Abbott, Catalano, & Hawkins,\nare frequently involved in illegal gang activity (Moore &\nHagedorn, 2001). While similar levels of peer delinquency\nare observed, the role and influence these relationships have\non offending may differ across the genders. In particular,\nresearch describes the specific influence antisocial male\npartners and acquaintances can have on females with respect\nto offending behavior (Chesney-Lind, Morash, & Stevens,\n6 SAGE Open\nStattin & Magnusson, 1990), suggesting that peer delin-\nquency may represent a greater risk marker for females com-\npared with males.\nGender differences were noted with females receiving\nhigher risk ratings than males on items reflecting problem-\natic family and peer group relationships. This is consistent\nwith reports that a high proportion of imprisoned females\nlack stable and supportive families (Chesney-Lind et al.,\nfactors tapping caregiver\u00adchild interaction and connected-\nness have been found to be a better predictor of female\noffending than for males (Blum et al., 2003; Farrington &\nCMI have found that females are significantly more likely\nto score higher than males on the \"Family\" domain that\naddresses inadequate supervision and poor relationships\nThompson & McGrath, 2011). As inadequate parental\nsupervision and communication is linked with future delin-\nLoeber & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1986), family-based inter-\nventions such as multisystemic therapy may be of particu-\nlar value in reducing offending behavior in females\n(Henggeler, Melton, & Smith, 1992; Schaeffer & Borduin,\n2005), who are thought to be more adversely affected than\nmales when family and social bonds are disrupted\nIn the present study, females had significantly higher rates\nof peer rejection than males. Negative developmental experi-\nences with peers have been identified as risk factors for\nfuture delinquency (Hubbard & Pratt, 2002; Kupersmidt,\nliterature suggests that female pathways to crime often origi-\nnate from abusive, chaotic, lawless homes and relationships\nThe relatively high female SAVRY total scores from our\nsample are likely to reflect the presence of these \"pathway\"\nitems.\nWitnessing violence in the home is a risk factor for future\nviolence and aggression, particularly as youths model their\nbehavior on the interactions and responses of their caregivers\nfemales were significantly more likely than males to have\nhad exposure to violence at home. Indeed, our female sample\nfrequently reported periods of homelessness and domestic\nabuse from older and often delinquent partners suggesting\nthat they are leaving dysfunctional families and entering into\ndisharmonious relationships with partners.\nFurthermore, females were significantly more likely than\nmales to have a history of self-harm or suicide attempts. The\nlatter finding is consistent with previous research (Indig\nearlier SAVRY studies (Gammelg\u00e5rd et al., 2008; Lodewijks\nreported to have suffered high rates of physical and sexual\ntrauma (Chesney-Lind et al., 2008; Forsythe & Adams,\nMcReynolds, 2011), which may in turn contribute to subse-\nquent psychiatric symptomatology (Belknap & Holsinger,\n2006; Teplin, Abram, McClelland, Dulcan, & Mericle,\nVincent et al., 2008). Self-injury in female offenders tends\nto be associated with high rates of psychopathology as well\nas an increased risk for violent recidivism (Vollm & Dolan,\n2009) making this a significant treatment target for female\noffenders.\nSubstance abuse rates were high in the cohort with more\nthan three quarters of males and females receiving a high-\nrisk rating for this item, indicating chronic drug and alcohol\nuse. Although there were no gender differences in rates of\nsubstance abuse, our data are consistent with other studies\nnoting a high prevalence of substance use among youth\noffenders (Prichard & Payne, 2005; Sedlak & McPherson,\nhave found higher rates of problematic substance use\namong female offenders (Coid et al., 2009; Forsythe &\ners have been found significantly more likely than males to\nscore higher on the \"Substance Abuse\" domain using the\nand its adult version, the Level of Service Inventory\u00ad\nRevised (LSI-R; Heilbrun et al., 2008). Furthermore,\nAndrews et al. (2012) found the substance abuse item on\nthe LSI-R to be a stronger predictor of recidivism for female\noffenders. As drug and alcohol abuse are key situational\nfactors that inhibit rational responses and intensify violent\nbehavior (Farrington & Loeber, 2000; Hoaken & Stewart,\nneeds to be a key treatment target in offense reduction pro-\ngrams for both genders.\nIn this study, the prevalence of protective factors was\nlow in both genders and this may have contributed to our\nhigh total scores given that protective factors appear to\nmitigate violent reoffending (Lodewijks et al., 2010;\nRennie & Dolan, 2010). There were no striking gender dif-\nferences on each item other than females having signifi-\ncantly lower levels of prosocial involvement compared\nwith males. This finding contrasts with that of Gammelg\u00e5rd\net al. (2012) who found higher rates of prosocial involve-\nment among females. The findings appear to suggest that\ndeviant social peers may have a greater influence on\noffending behavior in Australian female offenders and that\nthe development of more prosocial bonds will be critical in\nreducing offending behavior.\nShepherd et al. 7\nLimitations\nSome limitations to the study are worth noting. The female\nyouth cohort in this study may not truly represent the major-\nity of female offenders outside of Victoria, particularly due\nto the jurisdictional policy of detaining youth as a last resort,\nresulting in only the most severe female youths ending up in\ncustody. Conversely, the results may generalize to the high-\nrisk end of young female offenders. Second, the female sam-\nple size was small and comparatively lower than the male\ncohort. The disparity is a reflection of the predominance of\nmale criminality and low proportion of females in the juve-\nnile and adult justice systems in Australia. While nonpara-\nmetric analyses were conducted to account for the discrepant\nsample sizes, this did reduce the power of resultant analyses\nand the size of effects that could be detected. As such, there\ncould potentially be further differences between males and\nfemales that went undetected. Conversely, the effects that\nwere observed in this study are likely to be larger in the pop-\nulation than were observed. Nevertheless, the size of the\nfemale sample was similar to previous SAVRY studies com-\nparing gender (Lodewijks et al., 2008; Meyers & Schmidt,\nthe SAVRY instrument was not conducted. The theme of the\narticle was to identify how the prevalence and severity of\nrisk items may differ between male and female young offend-\ners in a particularly violent sample. As the SAVRY instru-\nment encompasses a concert of pertinent antecedents to\nyouth violence, it was selected primarily as a checklist for\ngender comparison.\nConclusion\nThe study contributes to extant literature on risk factors for\nyouth violence risk, though undertaken in a unique\nAustralian youth justice context. Gender differences on\nSAVRY domains and individual items were discovered.\nFactors including family dysfunction/breakdown, peer\nrejection, and self-harming behavior were found to be over-\nrepresented among female offenders. The findings reflect\nthe literature on gendered pathways to offending and in par-\nticular highlight cogent female-specific risk factors that may\nmanifest through experiences of abuse and associated\ntrauma. The findings add to the growing base of gender-\nspecific research highlighting a common array of risk fac-\ntors shared by young and adult female offenders.\nMultifaceted gender responsive treatment programs focus-\ning on connectivity and emotional guidance, empowerment,\nrepairing relationships, and specific services providing sup-\nport for trauma, abuse, child care, employment opportuni-\nties, and drug dependency could provide unique holistic\nsupport in addressing key needs. Further research is required\nto determine the validity of the SAVRY and other widely\nused youth violence risk prediction instruments across gen-\nder in Australian young offender populations.\nStructured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY; Borum, Bartel, & Forth, 2003).\nHistorical factors Social/contextual risk factors\n History of violence  Peer delinquency\n History of nonviolent offending  Peer rejection\n Early initiation of violence  Stress and poor coping\n Past supervision or intervention failures  Poor parental management\n History of self-harm or suicide attempts  Lack of personal or social support\n Exposure to violence in the home  Community disorganization\n Childhood history of maltreatment Individual/clinical risk factors\n Parental or caregiver criminality  Negative attitudes\n Early caregiver disruption  Risk taking/impulsivity\n Poor school achievement  Substance use difficulties\nProtective factors  Low empathy/remorse\n Prosocial involvement  Attention deficit/hyperactivity difficulties\n Strong social support  Poor compliance\n Strong attachment and bonds  Low interest/commitment to school\n Positive attitude toward intervention and authority \n Strong commitment to school \n Resilient personality traits \nAppendix\n"
