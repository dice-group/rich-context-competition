Early life circumstances, in-\ncluding socioeconomic and related physical factors, are\nthought to influence health across the life span (Dowd,\nEhrenstein, Mikolajczyk, & Zhang, 2009). Education gen-\nerally occurs in childhood and adolescence when neurode-\nvelopment is more rapid than in later life. More education is\nfrequently linked to better cognitive performance and is\nthought to influence brain capacity and/or cognitive reserve.\nEducation as a feature of the early socioeconomic environ-\nment has later consequences for income and occupational\nopportunity in adulthood, which is consistently linked to\nmidlife and late life health status. Thus, SES in early life\nand midlife may indirectly influence cognitive aging via its\ninfluence on health. However, income and occupation\nchange in old age and measures of these taken in old age do\nnot accurately reflect the effects of SES across the life span.\nIt is not clear whether it is the shape of the trajectory of SES\nchange over a lifetime or whether it is accumulated disad-\nvantage that matters most to produce greater ill health in old\nage in those with sustained exposure to poverty.\nThe bulk of work on lifetime SES trajectories or accumu-\nlated disadvantage and cognitive aging has not included as-\nsessment of the effects of race, ethnicity, or migration and\ncultural change on the life-span trajectory and cognitive\nperformance. However, there is growing evidence that the\nimpact of life course trajectories on cognitive aging may vary\nby ethnicity (Clarke, O'Malley, Johnston, & Schulenberg,\ntrajectory of both SES and health status, leading to differ-\nences in cognitive aging by migration history in later life.\nMoreover, the effects of migration on late life health may\nnot be restricted to a single generation. Intergenerational\nimprovements in economic and educational opportunities\nachieved by migration may lead to better health and cogni-\ntive aging in newer generations. Sustained intergenerational\nexposures to low or high SES or to upward or downward\nmobility are often driven by environmental changes, such as\nmigration. The trajectory of early life to adult SES may or\nmay not be modified by changes in cultural and socioeco-\nnomic contexts that accompany migration. Although up-\nward mobility is often an intended goal of migration,\ndownward mobility or sustained deprivation are also com-\nmon consequences.\nThe purpose of this work is to examine the association\nbetween socioeconomic trajectories from childhood through\nadulthood with late life cognitive performance over 9 years\non cognitive tests of global ability and verbal memory done\nin a cohort of immigrant and U.S.-born Mexican Ameri-\ncans. We will also evaluate the potential modifying role of\nmigration on the association between lifetime SES and late\nlife cognitive performance.\nLife-span Socioeconomic Trajectory, Nativity, and\nCognitive Aging in Mexican Americans: The Sacramento\nArea Latino Study on Aging\nMary N.

Early life circumstances influence health across the life span. Migration and ethnicity may modify the\nlifetime trajectory of socioeconomic status (SES) and lead to heterogeneity in cognitive aging in later life.\nMethods. We examined the effects of both lifetime socioeconomic trajectory and cumulative disadvantage from\nchildhood through adulthood on late life cognitive performance in a 9-year cohort of 1,789 Mexican Americans aged\nResults. Compared with those with low SES sustained over the life course, we found that those with more advantaged\nlifetime SES trajectories experienced fewer declines on a test of global cognitive function and a short-term verbal\nmemory test. These associations are larger in first- and second-generation immigrant families.\nDiscussion. Heterogeneity of cognitive aging among diverse race/ethnic groups may be influenced by intergenera-\ntional changes in SES, cultural norms, and behaviors and changes in health related to changes in the social and physical\nenvironment.\nKey Words: Acculturation--Cognition--Epidemiology--Life course and developmental change.\nMethods\nStudy population\nParticipants included in this analysis were from the Sac-\nramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). SALSA is\na longitudinal cohort study of 1,789 community-dwelling\nMexican Americans residing in California's Sacramento\n1999. The majority of the participants were born in Mexico\n(51%) or the United States (49%). The study population and\nthe recruitment of SALSA participants have been described\nin detail elsewhere (Haan et al., 2003). Participants were\nfollowed every 12\u00ad15 months via home visits that included\nclinical and cognitive assessments. A semiannual phone call\nwas made to obtain updates on medications, health events,\nand some sociodemographic risk factors. Annual attrition\nfrom baseline through 2008 averaged 5%, including mortal-\nity and loss to follow up. SALSA was approved by the Insti-\ntutional Review Board at the University of Michigan and\nthe University of California at San Francisco and Davis.\nMeasures\nCognitive performance tests.--At each home visit, which\nwas every 12\u00ad15 months, the participant received two cog-\nnitive tests: the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination\n(3MSE) and the Spanish English Verbal Learning Test\n(SEVLT). The 3MSE is a 100-point cognitive exam compo-\nsed of several cognitive domains that provides an assess-\nment of global cognitive function. It has greater sensitivity\nand specificity and fewer floor and ceiling effects for detect-\ning impairment than the Mini-Mental State Examination\nand has excellent test\u00adretest properties (Teng & Chui, 1987;\nTombaugh, 2005). The 3MSE has been validated and field\ntested in Spanish and English. The SEVLT is a delayed\nword list recall test with four 15-word memory trials, an\ninterference list, followed by a fifth trial, which is usually\nused as the test score (Gonzalez, Mungas, & Haan, 2002,\nThe SEVLT was developed (Gonzalez et al., 2005) for use\nin SALSA and has been validated in both Spanish and Eng-\nlish and used in other studies. Participants were allowed to\nbe interviewed in the language of their choice.\nDementia/cognitive impairment without dementia--The\nprocedures to diagnose dementia and cognitive impairment\nwithout dementia (CIND) have been described in detail\nelsewhere (Haan et al., 2003). Briefly, there were several\nphases of cognitive screening, a clinical exam and magnetic\nresonance imaging for suspected dementia cases. Standard\ndiagnostic criteria for dementia from Diagnostic and Statis-\ntical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., were applied.\nThis procedure was highly sensitive (100%) and specific\n(75.1%). Those with dementia/CIND at baseline are exclud-\ned from these analyses.\nSocioeconomic mobility from childhood to adulthood\nChildhood SES.--In baseline interviews, study partici-\npants reported the years of education completed by their\nmothers and fathers. Most parents did not have any formal\nschooling (50% of mothers and 49% of fathers), and moth-\ner's and father's education was classified as low (did not\ncomplete elementary school) or high (completed elementa-\nry school or more). Mother's occupation was classified as\nlow (manual or housewives) or high (nonmanual), and\nfather's occupation was classified as low (manual or unem-\nployed) or high (nonmanual). Childhood food deprivation\nwas measured by participants' reports as to how often they\ndid not have enough to eat while growing up. Because 23%\nreported that they at least sometimes experienced food\ndeprivation, this variable was recoded as \"ever\" or \"never.\"\nParticipants also reported the number of siblings that sur-\nvived to adulthood as an indicator of early SES environ-\nment, which was then classified as \"yes\" (a sibling died in\nchildhood) or \"no\" (none died). (All participants had at\nleast one sibling.) Each variable included in the childhood\nSES score was dichotomized. To measure childhood SES,\nwe created a composite measure that combined mother's\nand father's education and occupation, food deprivation,\nand early sibling mortality. Ranging from 0 to 6, childhood\nSES score was then collapsed into two categories as high\nAdult SES.--Participant's education was obtained at the\nbaseline interview by asking how many years of education\nthey had completed. This was categorized into low (less\nthan high school) or high (high school or more).\nParticipant's occupation was classified as low (manual, un-\nemployed, or housewives) or high (nonmanual). Partici-\npants also reported their current monthly household\nincome, which was split at the median with low (income <\nscale was created that combined participant's education,\noccupation, and income that ranged from 0 to 3, where 3\ndenoted worse SES. Adulthood SES was then collapsed\ninto two categories as high adulthood SES (26.4%) and low\nThe two-level childhood SES was then cross-classified\nwith the two-level adulthood SES creating a four-level SES\nmobility variable, with each level representing a distinct SES\ntrajectory from childhood to adulthood: all low (54.7%), high\nanalyses, all low was used as the reference category.\nCumulative SES disadvantage\nA scale to measure the cumulative SES disadvantage\n(CD) across the life course was constructed by summing the\ndichotomous variables for childhood SES, education, life-\ntime occupation, and participants' late life household in-\ncome into a scale ranging from 0 to 9.\nNativity, number of generations born in Mexico, and\nbirth cohort\nNativity was based on the participant's self-report of\ntheir country of birth. Participants were either born in the\nUnited States or born in the Mexico and migrated to the\nUnited States. They also reported nativity for their parents\nand grandparents. We comprised \"generations\" since mi-\ngration as the number reported by the participants out of\nthree generations (e.g., grandparents, parents, and self)\nthat had been born in Mexico (e.g., all in United States =\nand grandparent = Gen 2 [39.2%] or self, and parents and\ngrandparents = Gen 3 [51%]). Participants were born\nSociodemographic and health covariates\nHealth variables known from our previous work to be as-\nsociated with cognitive function and dementia were selected\nfor this analysis. Fasting glucose level was measured from\nblood drawn at each visit. Diabetes was defined by self-report\nof a physician diagnosis, use of diabetes medication, and/or\na fasting glucose level greater or equal to 126 mg/dl (ADA,\n2006). Prescription medication was obtained by a medicine\ncabinet inventory at the annual home visit and coded into\ngroups. Blood pressure was measured using standard blood\npressure protocols (Beevers, Lip, & O'Brien, 2001). Base-\nline hypertension was defined based on self-report of a MD\ndiagnosis or a baseline systolic blood pressure greater than\n140 mm Hg or a baseline diastolic blood pressure greater\ndefined by self-report of an MD diagnosis, including hospi-\ntalization for stroke. Participants also reported whether they\nhad health insurance as well as their smoking status (ever\nvs. never) and alcohol consumption. These did not vary by\nSES or nativity and were not included in further analyses.\nStatistical analyses\nAnalyses in this study included 1,626 participants who\ndid not have a dementia/CIND diagnosis at baseline. De-\nscriptive statistics of the study population were compared\nacross the two nativity groups and two-tailed chi-square\ntests for categorical variables, and one-way analysis of vari-\nance for continuous variables were used to test for differ-\nences. Mixed linear models with repeated measures options\nwere used to model the associations between SES and the\ntwo cognitive outcomes. The 3MSE was coded as the natu-\nral log of errors (log [101-score]) in order to approximate\nnormality for the mixed linear models. Analysis of longitu-\ndinal change in the 3MSE log of errors revealed an inverse\n\"u\" nonlinear trajectory over time that was characterized by\nan improvement in test scores through follow-up Visit 2 and\na subsequent decline in test scores through the last visit.\nAfter model-fitting tests, segmented regression was used for\nthis analyses that involved the use of two separate time pe-\nriods broken at or before or after the second follow-up visit.\nThis is sometimes attributed to practice effects; however,\nTombaugh (2005) has reported minimal such effects over\nperiods of retesting more than a year.\nThe SEVLT met the normality assumptions of the mixed\nlinear model and was not transformed. Segmentation was\nnot used for the SEVLT because the association between\ntime and SEVLT score was linear. In SEVLT models, time\nwas treated as the visit number. After evaluation of unad-\njusted models including only the three SES terms (not\nshown), Model 1 included interactions between time and\neach indicator variable (high to high, high to low, and low to\nhigh) compared with those who remained low. Model 2\nadded adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related\ncovariates. A similar strategy was pursued for the cumula-\ntive deprivation scale.\nData analysis.--Several methods have emerged in an at-\ntempt to deal with any biasing effects of attrition from lon-\ngitudinal studies. These include restriction of the analysis to\nparticipants with complete data on all variables of interest,\noften called list-wise deletion analysis. However, the value\nof such restriction is founded on the unlikely assumption\nthat data are missing completely at random (Rubin, 1976),\nwhich is rarely met in population-based studies. Therefore,\nwe selected a more efficient and less restrictive approach for\nthe analyses in the present study. We used a multiple imputa-\ntion approach that conditioned on all data set variables as\npredictors in a sequence of multiple regressions (Raghuna-\nare run in a cyclic manner that overwrites previously drawn\nvalues and in the interdependence between the imputed val-\nues. By using all available variables, the multiple imputa-\ntion approach provides unbiased estimates while improving\nstatistical efficiency. Five imputed data sets were produced\nthat include all study variables and used for this analysis.All\nmultiple linear regression models (PROC MIXED) were run\nin sets of five and summarized with PROC MIANALYZE\nResults\nTable 1 displays covariates by the number of generations\nborn in Mexico (0\u00ad3) for the study population. The percent\nof women was highest among Gen 0 and Gen 3 families.\nGen 0 and Gen 3 families were slightly older than Gen 1 or\nGen 2.Year of birth did not vary significantly by generation.\nParticipant education was highest in Gen 0 and Gen 1 fami-\nlies and lowest in Gen 3 families. Participants from Gen 3\nand Gen 0 families had the highest percent of manual oc-\ncupations compared with Gen 2 families. Nearly everyone\nhad health insurance, but in Gen 3 families, 16.3% did not.\nThe percent of participants whose fathers' and mothers'\neducation was less than elementary school was highest\namong Gen 2 and Gen 3 families. The percent of fathers\nwith a manual occupation was highest in Gen 1 families.\nHunger in childhood was lowest in Gen 3 families and\nhighest in Gen 1 families. Sibling childhood mortality was\nhighest in participants from Gen 3 families. Low SES in\nchildhood or adulthood was highest in Gen 2 and Gen 3\nfamilies. Cumulative SES disadvantage was highest in\nGen 3 families followed by Gen 2 families with the least\nCD-SES in Gen 0 families.\nBaseline 3MSE errors were highest in Gen 3 families,\nfollowed by Gen 2, Gen 0, and Gen 1 families. A similar\npattern was seen in the number of words recalled for the\nbaseline SEVLT. There were no differences by generation\nin the median number of visits at which the 3MSE or the\nSEVLT was assessed. Diabetes was most prevalent among\nGen 3, followed by Gen 0, Gen 2, and Gen 1, respectively.\nGen 3 diabetics were less likely to be treated than Gen 0\ndiabetics. Stroke and hypertension were highest in Gen 0\nand lowest in Gen 3. Systolic blood pressure was highest in\nGen 3 and lowest in Gen 0. Diastolic blood pressure did not\ndiffer by generation.\nFigure 1 illustrates the distribution of lifetime SES trajec-\ntories by the number of generations born in Mexico. Among\nall U.S. (Gen 0) families, there was considerable upward\nand downward mobility in the lives of study participants,\nsplit roughly equally between low to high and high to low.\nAbout 34% maintained high SES across the life span.\nAmong grandparent-only families (Gen 1), 35% were al-\nways low, 32% went from low to high, 21% were always\nhigh, and nearly 12% went from high to low. Among two-\ngeneration families (Gen 2), nearly 45% remained low, 27%\nwent from high to low. Among three-generation families\n(Gen 3), more than 66% remained low, 5% remained high\nSES, 5.6% improved in SES, and nearly 23% of participants\ndeclined from high to low SES. Across generations, the per-\ncent of participants who remained in a low SES position\ndeclined as more generations were born in the United States.\nDownward mobility was highest in Gen 0 and Gen 3,\nwhereas upward mobility was similar in Gen 0, Gen 1, and\nslightly lower in Gen 2. Upward mobility was lower in Gen\n3. The median number of cumulative deprivations remained\nat 7 for the always low group and 3 for the always high\ngroup; upwardly mobile had a median of five deprivations\nexcept inGen 1 and downwardly mobile had by generation:\nTable 1.

Model 1 shows that those who maintained high\nSES throughout life and those who moved from low to high\nSES experienced fewer errors on the 3MSE compared with\nthose who remained at low SES in childhood and adulthood.\nThose who moved from high to low SES also had fewer\n3MSE errors than the low\u00adlow group, but the effect was\nslight compared with the high\u00adhigh and low\u00adhigh groups.\nInteractions between the three SES trajectory categories and\nthe two time period variables were not statistically signifi-\ncant (not included in Table 2). Adjustment for covariates\n(Model 2) reduced the coefficients for high\u00adhigh and low\u00ad\nhigh groups by about 18% and only slightly affected the\nhigh to low group compared with the low to low group. The\n3MSE log errors among those remaining at high SES and\nfor those moving from low to high SES are the same, where-\nas there is much less benefit among those moving from high\nto low. Older age and a larger number of generations born in\nMexico were associated with more 3MSE log errors as was\nhealth insurance, diabetes, and stroke but not hypertension.\nLog errors on the 3MSE declined in the first time period and\nincreased in the second. The association of the first time\nperiod to 3MSE log errors is negative and unaffected by\nFigure 1.

Because the coefficient for child-\nhood SES remained significant but slight, it appears that\nadult SES partially mediates the association between early\nSES and cognitive function in old age.\nTable 3 presents the results for two sequential mixed lin-\near models with the cumulative disadvantage scale (CD) as\na predictor for the 3MSE log of errors. Greater cumulative\nlifetime disadvantage was modestly associated with more\n3MSE log errors, equivalent to a 2.1-point increase in errors\nfor a 5-point difference in CD (the average). Adjustment for\ncovariates only slightly affected the association between\nCD and the log of errors on the 3MSE. Compared with Gen 3\n(all Mexican generations), Gen 0 was not associated with\nchange in the logerrors on the 3MSE and Gen1 and Gen 2\nhad fewer log errors on the 3MSE. The greatest benefit for\n3MSE scores is among Gen 1, followed by Gen 2, and then\nGen 0 compared with Gen 3, suggesting a nonlinear pattern\nof effects by generation. Neither the association between\nCD nor the generations and 3MSE errors were modified by\ntime/study period (not shown). The association between CD\nand 3MSE was not modified by the number of generations\nborn in Mexico. Lack of health insurance, diabetes, and\nstroke were all associated with more errors on the 3MSE,\nand hypertension was not associated with the 3MSE. Tests\nfor interaction between birth cohort and number of Mexican-\nborn generations in relation to the log of errors on the 3MSE\nwere not significant (not shown).\nTable 4 presents the results for two sequential mixed lin-\near models that evaluate the association between SES tra-\njectory categories and the SEVLT score as the dependent\nvariable. Compared with those in the always-low group, the\nalways-high and the low\u00adhigh group had higher SEVLT\nscores. The high\u00adlow group and the low\u00adhigh group had\nsignificantly better scores than the always-low group. Time\nmodified the associations between SES trajectory and the\nSEVLT such that all scores declined over time, most rapidly\nin the high\u00adhigh and the low\u00adhigh groups. This interaction\nwas only significant for the high\u00adhigh and the low\u00adhigh\ngroups compared with the always-low group. Adjustment\nfor covariates had little influence on the association between\nSES trajectory and SEVLT score. Older age, lack of health\ninsurance, diabetes, and stroke were all associated with\nlower SEVLT scores. Number of generations was not asso-\nciated with the SEVLT score. Tests for interaction between\nbirth cohort and number of Mexican-born generations in re-\nlation to the SEVLT were not significant (not shown).\nIn a separate analysis, the bivariate association between\nchildhood SES and SEVLT score was statistically significant\nTable 3.

Compared with\nthose with all three generations born in Mexico, those with\nonly grandparents (Gen 1) or with grandparents and parents\nborn in Mexico (Gen 2) performed better on the SEVLT. All\nU.S.\u00adborn generations (Gen 0) did not differ from all Mexico\u00ad\nborn generations (Gen 3) on the SEVLT. Generations mod-\nified the association between cumulative deprivation and\nSEVLT such that the SEVLT score was lower in Gen 1 or\nGen 2 as the number of deprivations increased.\nNativity and migration are important predictors of the life\ntime trajectories of SES, and they modify the relationship\nof lifetime SES to late life cognitive aging. There is more\nity in Gen 1 and Gen 2 than in Gen 0 and Gen 3. The highest\nlevel of sustained poverty is in Gen 3 (all Mexico), and the\nhighest level of sustained (relative) affluence is in Gen 0 (all\nUnited States). Participants who are immigrants are more\nlikely to remain poor, whereas participants whose parents\nand/or grandparents are U.S. born more likely to improve in\nSES. The greater occurrence of downward mobility in the\nthree U.S. generation group of participants may reflect de-\nclines in SES seen in more acculturated postimmigrant gen-\nIn this analysis, lifetime SES trajectories have strong\noverall influence on both global cognitive function and\nshort-term verbal memory such that those who are advan-\ntaged in both childhood and adulthood experience fewer\ndeclines in global cognition and verbal memory compared\nwith those who are less advantaged. Upward mobility is\nsimilarly beneficial for these outcomes. The number of gen-\nerations since migration to the Unites States also modifies\nthe effects of cumulative deprivation on global cognitive\nperformance and on memory. Compared with Gen 3 par-\nticipants, CD has more benefit for global cognition in Gen\n0, Gen 1, or Gen 2 participants. Verbal memory is more ad-\nversely affected by CD in Gen 1 and Gen 2 participants\ncompared with Gen 0 or Gen 3 participants. Importantly,\nthe links between early SES and late life cognitive aging\nappear to be at least partly mediated by adult SES. This\npoints to a pattern of accumulated deprivation (or improve-\nment), but the influences of upward and downward mobility\non cognitive aging suggest that nonlinear patterns are also\nimportant.\nDiscussion\ntime SES is associated with late life cognitive functioning.\nA recent study of a Chinese birth cohort (Zhang et al., 2009)\nsuggested that early life SES has an association with late\nlife cognitive function that is not explained by markers of\nearly nutritional development. Our results are consistent\nwith these other studies. Although we have little informa-\ntion about early nutritional status (other than reports of sib-\nling mortality and lack of food), we can indirectly infer the\nquality of the early environment from life expectancy (LE)\nat birth in Mexico or in the United States during the time\nrisen to 39 in Mexico and 62 in the United States. LE at\nbirth is a summary marker of environmental improvements\naffecting survival in children below 5 years (Johansson,\n2008). These LE data suggest that socioenvironmental and\nhealth quality in early life for our study participants differed\nsharply by country of birth. Improvements in LE over the\nment of younger participants was comparatively better than\nof older participants. However, comparison of the influence\nof numbers of generations on late life cognitive aging by\nbirth cohort did not reveal any effect modification.\nThis study was only able to follow participants from\nolder ages for a maximum of 9 years. As such, data on early\nlife SES are entirely retrospective. Attrition from the cohort\ndue to death may have lead to underestimates of the asso-\nciation between lifetime SES and late life cognitive func-\ntion, as both early and later life SES are inversely associated\nwith higher mortality. We do not have measures of cognitive\nability in early life as some studies have (Luciano et al.,\n2009). However, those studies have also experienced very\nsubstantial attrition across five to six decades and are likely\nto be biased in their estimates. Health and economic selec-\ntion are common features of the study of migration and are\nthought to result in an immigrant population that is at least\ninitially healthier and wealthier than the population remain-\ning in the sending country or than native born in the receiv-\ning country. We cannot account for this issue directly here.\nHowever, the average length of residence in the United\nStates was 35 years for participants who migrated. The\nforce of migration selection is likely to be weakened over\ntime by adaptation and increasing exposure to the new envi-\nronment and would have no direct relevance for migration\nby previous generations (Gen 1 and Gen 2).\nThis analysis has shown that both early life and midlife\nSES have individual effects on cognitive aging. The effects\non cognitive aging of early SES are partially mediated by\nmidlife SES. We have demonstrated that nativity and migra-\ntion are related to differences in lifetime SES trajectories.\nThe heterogeneity of cognitive aging trajectories observed\namong diverse race/ethnic groups may be influenced by in-\ntergenerational changes in SES, cultural norms, and behav-\niors and changes in health related to changes in the social\nand physical environment. Lifetime trajectories of change\nin SES may not be linear. The literature on life course sug-\ngests that there may be cumulative or \"chained\" effects of\nSES and/or that SES exposures in a specific stage, for\nexample, early childhood, may have a major role in late life\ncognitive aging. These differences are important in deter-\nmining when and how to intervene. Our results for upward\nand downward mobility suggest that modifications in the\nSES trajectory are possible. Education is a highly modifi-\nable SES factor that is thought to directly affect neurodevel-\nopment and certainly can lead to better jobs and more\nincome. In the United States, there are nearly 46 million\nU.S. residents who are Hispanic, of whom nearly 30 million\nwere born in Mexico (Pew Hispanic Center, 2010).
