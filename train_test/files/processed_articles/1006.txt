Perceived unmet need for personal assistance services (PAS) in activities of daily living (ADLs) and\ninstrumental ADLs and its association with reduced hours of help received and with adverse consequences due to lack of\nhelp are examined for adults aged 18 and older using data from the 1994\u00ad1997 National Health Interview Survey on\nDisability.\nMethods. A two-part multivariate regression model of the probability of PAS use and hours of help received was\ndeveloped to control for need level, living arrangements, and other characteristics that may differ between persons with\nmet and unmet needs and to determine the shortfall in hours associated with unmet need.\nResults. Individuals with unmet need for personal assistance with two or more of the five basic ADLs have a shortfall\nof 16.6 hours of help per week compared with those whose needs are met. The relative shortfall is twice as great for\npersons who live alone as for those who live with others. People who live alone and have unmet needs fare worse than\npeople with unmet needs who live with others, and both groups are more likely than those whose needs are met to\nexperience adverse consequences, including discomfort, weight loss, dehydration, falls, burns, and dissatisfaction with the\nhelp received.\nDiscussion. Overall, just 6.6% of needed hours are unmet among the 3.3 million people needing help in two or more\nADLs. We estimate the annual cost of eliminating unmet need among persons with incomes under 300% of the\nSupplemental Security Income level between $1.2 and $2.7 billion for those living alone and from $2.2 to $7.1 billion for\nthose living with others.\nCOMMUNITY-RESIDING adults of all ages with needs\nfor personal assistance services (PAS) in daily activities\nare at risk of all or some of their needs being unmet, which can\nreduce their quality of life, compromise safety, and increase\nrisks of a number of adverse consequences (Allen & Mor,\nThese include injuries from falls, burns, weight loss, de-\nhydration, discomfort, and other problems that can further\nworsen health and disability and increase risks of institution-\nalization and death. Minimizing unmet need is the primary goal\nunderlying long-term care policy.\nPAS refers to human help provided to individuals in specific\nactivities that are generally obligatory for bodily maintenance\nand for living in the community, comprising the activities of\ndaily living (ADLs; bathing, dressing, transferring from a bed\nor chair, toileting, and eating) and the instrumental activities of\ndaily living (IADLs; such as taking medications and shopping\nfor groceries). PAS include all help, whether hands-on,\nstandby, or supervisory, whether paid or unpaid. Unmet need\noccurs when assistance from others is needed but not provided\nor inadequate.\nThere are many causes of unmet need. Over 85% of all of the\nhours of assistance people receive with ADLs and IADLs are\nprovided by family and friends (LaPlante, Harrington, & Kang,\n2002). Informal helpers, who may have to balance other\nresponsibilities, including work and child care, are often limited\nin the amount of help they can provide. People with low\ninformal resources, such as those who live alone, are especially\nlikely to have unmet needs and depend largely on formal\nassistance, if affordable and available. Public PAS remain\nbiased toward institutional rather than community living\n(Harrington et al., 2000), and people who live in states that\ndo not provide enough home- and community-based services\nmay be at greater risk of unmet need (LeBlanc, Tonner, &\nTo address the magnitude of the problem of unmet need for\nPAS, it is useful to know what the national prevalence of unmet\nneed is, what populations are most at risk, and how much of\ntheir needs are lacking. Surveys of individuals are convenient\nfor measuring unmet need because obtaining professional judg-\nments on a large scale is prohibitively expensive (Williams,\nLyons, & Rowland, 1997). The prevalence of survey-\ndiscovered unmet need lies between one fifth and one third of\nelderly people with PAS needs (Desai et al., 2001; Kennedy,\nThe need for PAS spans a continuum, measured often by the\nnumber and type of ADLs a person requires human help with.\nThe ADLs define a hierarchy of needs (Katz & Akpom, 1976),\nwith dependence in eating defining the most severe need. The\nIADLs define a lesser degree of need for PAS. An important\nmeasurement issue concerns who determines need. Bradshaw\n(1972) outlined several distinctions in operationally defining\nneed: normative need, which is assessed by experts; felt need,\nthe level of help the individual feels he or she needs; expressed\nneed, the amount of help received or demanded by the\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nindividual; and comparative need, disparities in help received.\nConflict arises between normative and felt need, as when\na professional feels that institutional placement is warranted but\nthe individual may not want it or when the individual wants\nhelp that a professional will not give. Differences are known to\nexist between professional and self-assessments of need. In one\nstudy, self-rated ADL disability was greater than that observed\nby professionals (Kelly-Hayes, Jette, Wolf, D'Agostino, & Odel,\n1992). Professionals assess need differently than individuals,\nbut neither is necessarily better than the other (Verbrugge &\nCertainly, if need is a continuum, then unmet need is also\na continuum. Some people may lack help entirely, whereas\nothers may need just a little more help. A professional may\njudge that a person needs a lot of help when he or she receives\nonly a little. Few studies exist comparing self-reports and\nprofessional assessments of unmet need. One study suggests\nthat self-ratings of unmet need may be conservative compared\nwith professional ratings of unmet need (Morrow-Howell,\nTo advance the understanding of unmet need beyond mere\nprevalence, it is useful to know how much help is lacking and\nwhat the cost might be to address it. Quantifying unmet need\nfor PAS in terms of the shortfall in hours of help is an important\nstep in that direction. This analysis builds on a prior national\nstudy estimating hours of PAS received among adults of\nall ages (LaPlante et al., 2002) to examine the relationship of\nhours with unmet need. We define unmet need as the gap be-\ntween felt need and expressed need. We use a large nationally\nrepresentative survey to estimate the shortfall in hours asso-\nciated with unmet need by comparing the hours of help re-\nceived by people who report that their needs are met with those\nwhose needs are unmet, after controlling for population\ndifferences in need levels and demographics (comparative\nneed). We then estimate the cost of eliminating the unmet-need\nshortfall in hours and demonstrate that unmet need is associated\nwith a variety of adverse consequences.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData are from supplements to the National Health Interview\nSurvey (NHIS), a large nationally representative survey of\nhouseholds in the United States conducted annually by the\nCensus Bureau for the U.S. National Center for Health\nNHIS (94% core response rate) were given a supplemental\nscreening questionnaire, known as Phase I of the National\nHealth Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D; U.S. NCHS,\nPhase I response rate) were screened for disability, using an\nextensive set of criteria including functional limitation, specific\ndisabling diagnoses, perception of disability, and use of\ndisability-related services. A sample of 32,788 individuals\nwas reinterviewed in Phase II (89% Phase II response rate), also\nknown as the Disability Followback Survey. Data collection\nreinterviews taking place between 7 and 26 months after the\nPhase I interview (normally distributed about the mean of\n14 months). Phase I excluded individuals in nursing homes,\nprisons, and large residential facilities. About 3.1% of the\neligible adult sample died before follow-up, 3.4% refused, 3.0%\ncould not be located, and 1.4% were not interviewed for un-\nknown reasons. A small number of respondents moved into\ninstitutions and, although interviewed, were excluded from this\nanalysis (n \u00bc 335). The sample for this analysis is restricted to\nadults with met or unmet need for help in any IADL/ADL\nMeasures\nData from Phase II of the NHIS-D are used to estimate met\nand unmet need for assistance with ADLs/IADLs and to\nestimate hours of paid and unpaid help received. Individuals\nwere asked if they were helped in any of 5 ADL and 10 IADL\nactivities, including hands-on help, supervision, or stand-by\nhelp, and whether they needed help or more help (activities\na person does not do for reasons other than health are\nexcluded). Individuals who lacked help or needed more help in\none or more ADL/IADL activities are defined as having unmet\nneed. For each of up to four helpers, the respondent was asked\n(a) how many days the helper helped during the last 2 weeks\nand (b) how many hours per day the helper provided help. The\ntwo measures were multiplied for each helper, summed over\nhelpers, and divided by 2, to yield the total hours received per\nweek.\nThe survey contains a number of demographic variables that\nare used in this analysis. Age and living arrangement were\nmeasured in Phase II; gender, race, and individual income were\nmeasured in the initial interview. A measure of the presence of\ncognitive symptoms (Phase I) was constructed by combining\naffirmative responses on having ``a lot of trouble concentrating\nlong enough to complete everyday tasks,'' being ``frequently\nconfused, disoriented, or forgetful,'' or having ``Alzheimer's\ndisease or another type of senile disorder.'' A second variable\nindicating cognitive impairment was whether the respondent\nhad a proxy interview in Phase II because of poor memory,\nsenility, confusion, Alzheimer disease, or other mental\ncondition.\nSeveral additional questions were asked about experiencing\ndiscomfort and other problems when individuals could not do\nactivities as frequently as they needed to (Phase II). Additional\nquestions were asked about falls, bedsores, contractures,\ndissatisfaction with the person's primary helper, and problems\nof being left alone. In some cases, respondents were asked if the\nproblem was caused by a lack of help, thus attributing causality\nto unmet need. This battery yielded 53 measures that we used\nfor this study. We expected that people with unmet need would\nbe more likely to experience these problems and be more likely\nto be dissatisfied.\nLess than 3% of responses are missing for the ADL need for\nhelp items and ,6% for the IADL items. Cognitive symptoms\nwere missing in ,1% of records. As item nonresponse is\ngenerally low on these measures, we assume, when it occurs,\nthat the individual does not have the characteristic in question.\nReason for proxy interview was not ascertained for about 20%\nof those with proxy interviews; in these cases, we assume that\na proxy response was needed for reasons other than cognitive\nones.\nThe data set includes imputation for individual income based\non a detailed hot deck imputation procedure carried out by the\nUniversity of Michigan Survey Research Center (U.S. NCHS,\nADLs, 33.3% had some income components imputed, the most\nfrequent being earnings and interest income.\nThe hours data used for the dependent variable included data\nwe imputed previously for 19.5% of persons who said they\nwere helped in the last 2 weeks but had missing data for the\nnumber of days or hours per day. We used multiple imputation,\nan iterative approach generally considered the most appropriate\nmethod when dependent variable data are missing (Crawford,\nhours were not random: Those with missing data were actually\nsomewhat less disabled. The imputation involved estimating\nthree separate regression models for hours received from paid\nhelpers, a primary informal helper, and secondary informal\nhelpers. Independent variables included demographics, living\narrangement, income, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, supply\nof helpers, and IADL and ADL activities the helpers helped\nwith. The imputation introduces a random component to the\nregression parameters, based on their estimated variances, and\nthe prediction is replicated 10 times to yield a distribution of\nvalues, which were then averaged and summed over the three\nmodels to yield imputed total hours (LaPlante et al., 2002).\nThe 53 adverse consequence items had low nonresponse,\ngenerally under 8%, with the exception being three questions\nregarding needing help eating (about 16%) and several satis-\nAnalysis Methods\nWe employed statistical methods to estimate the shortfall in\nhours associated with unmet need. The hours data are\nnonnormal in two ways: There are some cases with 0 hours\nand some with a high number of hours. Using multivariate\nregression methods, we estimated a two-part model of PAS\nutilization (Duan, Manning, Morris, & Newhouse, 1983),\nwhich takes into account both types of skewness: The first step\npredicts whether or not any hours of help are received by\nweighted logistic regression, and the second step predicts the\nhours of help among recipients by weighted least-squares\n(WLS) regression, using survey sampling weights in both. In\nthe latter, we use the logarithm of hours as the dependent\nvariable to eliminate right skewness. Each person's level of\nneed is measured by 15 dummy variables for the specific\nIADLs/ADLs they need help with. The log-transformed\ndependent variable in the WLS regression makes the contribu-\ntions of the activities multiplicative rather than additive. That is,\nthe logarithm of the total hours received does not equal the sum\nof the logarithms of the hours received for each activity. We\ninclude a count of multiple activities to correct for this effect, an\ninteger equal to the number of activities minus 2, if help is\nneeded in two or more activities, or 0 otherwise.\nFour dummy variables measure cognitive difficulties: having\ncognitive symptoms, being unable to manage money, being\nunable to manage medications, and having a proxy interview\nbecause of a cognitive condition. Living arrangements are\nmeasured using two dummy variables: living alone and living\nwith a spouse, the comparison group being those who live with\nothers. To identify individuals with low incomes based on\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility criteria, two\nadditional dummy variables are included classifying personal\nincome at or below 100% of SSI federal benefit rate ($446 per\nrate level, the comparison group being those with incomes\n.300% of the federal benefit rate. Although individuals on\nMedicaid may retain $2,000 in tangible assets, the survey\nquestions were not detailed enough to make further distinctions\non assets. The unadjusted data suggest that unmet need has\na larger impact among people with two or more ADLs (as\ndiscussed herein; Table 1), so we wished to test that. We further\nwished to distinguish unmet-need effects by whether people\nlive alone or with others. Four dummy variables measure the\neffects of unmet need for four population groups of interest:\npeople living alone or living with others and having fewer than\ntwo or two or more ADL needs. These groups are compared\nwith those who have no unmet need. We developed the models\nfirst introducing unmet need and living arrangements, then level\nof need, and finally, age, race, gender, and income. We deleted\nvariables not significant in either model. In the WLS model, we\nascertained that the model residuals were normally distributed.\nA concern may arise over a potential circularity between the\nmeasures of unmet need and hours of help received, in that\nunmet need is determined in large part by a perceived shortfall\nin hours. However, the presence of unmet need (needing more\nhelp in any one activity) does not determine the total hours of\nhelp received. If there were circularity, hours of help and unmet\nneed would be correlated, but they are not (Pearson r \u00bc .002,\nThe predicted probability of receiving any help is calculated\nusing the exponentiated model parameters from the logistic\nmodel. To retransform the predictions of the WLS regression\n(predicted logarithm of hours) into a linear scale (predicted\nhours), we exponentiate the model prediction and multiply by a\nretransformation or ``smearing'' factor (Duan, 1983; Duan et al.,\n1983), obtained by averaging the exponentiated residuals.\nHeteroscedasticity across populations requires separate smear-\ning factors (Manning, 1998). We observe smaller mean squared\nresiduals for people living alone (versus living with others) or\nhaving two or more ADLs (versus less than two) and calculate\nseparate smearing factors for the four populations thus defined.\nWe then multiply the predicted probabilities of use by the\npredicted hours of use. Finally, we estimate the predicted hours\nof PAS for those with unmet need, along with their expected\nhours if their unmet need were to be eliminated, by setting the\nrelevant unmet need dummy variable to zero. The difference in\nexpected hours represents an estimate of the shortfall in hours,\nthe hours that would be required to fulfill the person's needs.\nThe weekly shortfall is multiplied by 52 weeks to obtain an\nannual estimate (which is allowable because the survey is\nconducted continuously). PAS costs are assumed to be $10 per\nhour on average, based on average state Medicaid reimburse-\nment data for PAS collected from a survey of state officials in\nstrap procedure (resampling with replacement) to calculate 95%\nconfidence intervals around the estimated cost.\nWe hypothesized that the percentage of people experiencing\nadverse consequences would be greater on every measure for\nthose with unmet versus met need, which we tested using a one-\ntailed t test. Because the estimates are based on a sample of the\npopulation, they are subject to sampling error. All estimates are\ncalculated using sampling weights, and sampling errors have\nbeen calculated directly using STATA survey data commands\n(Stata Corp., 2003), which take into account the geographic\nclustering of the sample design by Taylor series approximation.\nRESULTS\nAbout 15.1 million community-residing adults need help in\nneed (Table 1). The percentage with unmet need is lowest for\nthose who need help only in IADLs (18.3%) and generally\nincreases with higher numbers of ADLs, from 23.6% with one\nADL need to 34.6% at four ADLs, but declines to 25.9% at five\nADLs. Most people with unmet need get some help but do not\nget all the help they need. We find that only 545,000 adults\nof the 3.2 million with unmet need receive no help at all,\na population with a low level of disability, mostly needing help\nin IADLs only, and in particular the single activity of heavy\nhousework (not shown). For most people with unmet need, the\nissue is not whether they get help, but how much help they get.\nRelationship of Unmet Need to Hours of Help\nWe expect that people with unmet need would have fewer\nhours of help than those whose needs are met. We find only\na small difference in the mean hours of help received between\nthose with unmet versus met need among people who need help\nwith just IADLs or only one ADL (,2 hours per week) but\nlarge and highly significant differences for those needing help\nalmost a million--with perceived unmet need, who average\n16.1 fewer hours per week than those whose needs are met (see\nTable 1). Persons with unmet needs have fewer hours for each\nnumber of ADLs above one that they need help with, and the\ndifferences in mean hours are statistically significant for those\nneeding help in two, three, or five ADLs. If we combine those\nwith two or more ADLs, there is a large significant difference in\nmean hours for those with unmet needs, but not for those with\nfewer than two ADLs.\nThese differences in mean hours received, however, might\nbe due to differences between the met-need and unmet-need\npopulations with respect to level of need and other individual\ncharacteristics that influence the amount of help received. We use\nmultivariate methods to control for such differences to estimate\nthe true shortfall among people with unmet need for PAS.\nEstimating the Unmet-Need Shortfall in Hours\nThe sample means and standard deviations are shown in\nTable 2 for variables tested in the regressions, contrasting those\nwith and without unmet need. Adults with unmet need are less\nlikely to get help but receive about the same average hours\nwhen they do get help. They are more likely than those with no\nunmet need to be non-White, to be female, and to live alone.\nThey are less likely to live with a spouse, have a greater number\nof ADLs and IADLs, are more likely to have cognitive symp-\ntoms but less likely to have a proxy interview for cognitive or\nother reasons, and are slightly more likely to have incomes\nResults from the regression models are shown in Table 3.\nBoth models are highly significant. All the specific IADLs/\nADLs that individuals need help with are associated with\nTable 1.

The count of multiple\nactivities and its square are significantly negative in both\nmodels, making a negative adjustment to the chance of getting\nhelp and hours of help the more activities a person needs help\nwith. Cognitive symptoms have no relation to getting help but\nare associated with more hours of help received. Proxy or\nassisted interviews because of cognitive impairment have\na higher likelihood of getting help and more hours of help.\nProxy interviews for reasons other than cognitive impairment\nhave higher hours. Independent of measured need, neither\nbeing non-White nor being older is associated with the odds of\ngetting help, but both are associated with higher hours among\nthose who get help, as is individual income below 300% of the\nSSI level. Living alone has a large negative relation with\ngetting help and with hours.\nNow we consider the effects of unmet need, which is\nmeasured within four groups of interest. Among people with\nless than two ADLs who live with others, unmet need is\nassociated with lower odds of getting help but has no relation to\nhours (see Table 3). Among people with less than two ADLs\nwho live alone, unmet need is associated with lower odds of\ngetting help and fewer hours of help received. Among those\nwith two or more ADLs who live with others, unmet need is not\nrelated to getting help but is associated with fewer hours.\nAmong those who live alone and have two or more ADLs,\nunmet need is associated with a lower odds of getting help and\nfewer hours. The combined effect of unmet need is largest\namong people who live alone.\nIn Table 4, the shortfall in hours estimated by the regression\nmodels is shown for people with two or more ADLs who have\nunmet need, by living arrangement and income level. As\nexplained in Analysis Methods, the estimated shortfall is the\nmodel prediction of the difference between needed and received\nhours. Overall, people needing help in two or more ADLs and\nreporting unmet need receive 56.2 hours of help and are\nTable 2.

Those who live with others receive substantially\nmore help (66.1 hours) but need an additional 16.0 hours; their\nrelative shortfall is a more modest 19.5%. People with fewer\nthan two ADLs with unmet need are omitted owing to their\nrelatively small shortfall (4 hours) and lesser policy import.\nCost of Eliminating Unmet Need\nWe made a simple estimate of the cost of eliminating the\nshortfall in hours among people with low income (below 300%\nof the SSI eligibility level) who live alone and have perceived\nunmet need. The calculation is based on what it would cost to\nsupply enough paid hours annually to eliminate the gap in\nweekly hours associated with unmet need. We assumed paid\nhelpers would receive an hourly rate of $10. This comes to\nincomes below 300% of the SSI level (see Table 4) who live\nbillion. The cost of eliminating the shortfall in hours associated\nwith unmet need among the half-million people with low\nincome who live with others comes to about $4.7 billion; the\nNegative Consequences of Unmet Need\nand Dissatisfaction\nEven people whose needs are usually met can experience\nadverse consequences owing to lack of help, if a helper is not\navailable at the right time and place, or if the quality of help\nis inadequate. But we would generally expect people with\nperceived unmet needs to have a higher frequency of adverse\nexperiences. For all comparisons where a significant difference\nis observed, people with unmet needs have a higher rate of\nTable 3.

Of individuals who need help with two\nor more ADLs, those with unmet needs have significantly\ngreater probability of adverse consequences than those whose\nneeds are met on 29 of 34 measures tested (Table 5). These\nmeasures include discomfort, distress, mobility restriction,\ndoing activities oneself that the person needs help with, and\nmore serious concerns such as going hungry, running out of\nfood, getting burned, unintentional weight loss, and dehydra-\ntion. Many of these measures specifically attribute lack of help\nas the cause of the events, such as going hungry because no\nhelp was available to eat.\nPeople with unmet needs also experience a variety of\nsecondary conditions (Table 6) at rates significantly higher than\nthose whose needs are met, including falls and injuries due to\nfalls, bedsores, and contractures. Of those with unmet needs,\n51% attributed their falls to lack of help in getting around or\ninability of their helper to prevent their falling compared with\n32% of those whose needs are met. People with unmet need are\nmuch less satisfied with their primary helper's availability and\nthe amount of assistance they give as well as other aspects of\ntheir helping abilities, and they are more likely to be left alone\nand to lack backup helpers.\nWe stratified by whether individuals lived alone or with\nothers, and within each group, we tested for differences\nbetween those with unmet versus met needs. Among people\nliving with others, we found that those with unmet needs were\nsignificantly more likely to report problems on 44 of the 53\nmeasures tested (see Tables 5 and 6). Among people who live\nalone, those with unmet needs were significantly more likely to\nhave problems on 38 of the 53 measures tested. Many of these\ndifferences are alarmingly large. In particular, people who live\nalone and have unmet need are 10 times as likely to go hungry\nbecause no one is available to help them eat as those whose\nmiss a meal because of lack of help with shopping (15.3%\nversus 0.7%), and 5 times as likely to lose weight un-\nwho live alone and have unmet needs are significantly more\nlikely to have problems than those who live with others and\nhave unmet needs (opposite of expected, having a weak helper\nwas significantly lower). Finally, of those whose needs are met,\nthose who live alone have similar rates of adverse consequences\nto those who live with others: Only 8 measures were\nsignificantly different. Thus, people who live alone and have\nunmet needs fare worse than people with unmet needs who live\nwith others, but both have higher risk of adverse consequences\nthan those whose needs are met. If needs are met, rates of\nadverse consequences and dissatisfaction are comparable\nbetween those living alone or with others.\nDISCUSSION\nUnmet need is prevalent among adults of all ages who have\nsubstantial needs for PAS. About 29% of adults needing help in\ntwo or more of the five basic ADLs need more help than they\nreceive. In a society where 85% of hours of help come from\nfamily and friends (LaPlante et al., 2002), the problem of unmet\nneed for PAS is magnified among people who live alone, 45%\nof whom have unmet need, compared with 26% of those who\nlive with others. This study demonstrates that an association\nexists between perceived unmet need and reduced hours of\nhelp, independent of level of disability, race, age, and income\nlevel.

Many of these events are specifically\nattributed by the respondent as resulting from lack of help.\nInferring causality on other measures lacking such attributions,\nlike contractures and bedsores occurring in the last 3 months, is\nhazardous because of the cross-sectional design of the survey.\nThe occurrence of such events may have precipitated a need for\nmore than the available level of help. Nevertheless, the weight\nof the evidence clearly suggests that unmet need is associated\nwith and attributed to much greater adversity.\nLimitations to these findings include the fact that need and\nunmet need are self-reported or proxy reported, whereas pro-\nfessional assessment could yield different results. Hours for\nthose whose needs are met are the standard against which the\nunmet-need shortfall is defined, and those hours are likely to be\ninfluenced by whether they are self-reported, proxy reported, or\nassessed by a professional. Item nonresponse necessitated\nimputation and proxy reporting raised questions of potential\nbias in reporting levels of need, unmet need, and hours.\nHowever, we determined that results were robust even when\nimputed hours and proxy reports were separately excluded in\nthe analysis (results not shown). Nevertheless, professional\nassessment could yield a different estimate of the shortfall.\nWorking-age adults account for half the prevalence of met\nand unmet need among those needing help in two or more\nADLs. We analyzed the working-age population separately and\nfound the results robust, although the relative shortfall in\nneeded hours is somewhat smaller than for all ages combined\n(18% versus 23%, results not shown). However, unmet need\namong people living alone is more an issue for the elderly,\nbecause two thirds of those living alone and needing more help\nare age 65 or older. It is notable that both age and being non-\nWhite have positive relationships to hours received after\ncontrolling for level of need, which may represent sociocultural\ndifferences in informal helping.\nAccess to paid help is critical for people who live alone\nbecause they are much more likely to receive paid help than are\nshown). Of people who live alone, those whose needs are met\nare more likely than those whose needs are unmet to get paid\nhalf of that paid help is reported to be paid by Medicare or\nMedicaid. Among people living with others, the difference in\ngetting paid help by unmet need is much smaller (25.7% versus\nPAS appears crucial in reducing unmet need among those who\nlive alone. A limitation of the data is that family helpers were\nnot asked if they were paid, which may accentuate differences\nbetween paid and unpaid help by living arrangement.\nIf the estimated shortfall in hours were to be provided\nthrough public funds, the cost of eliminating unmet need\namong people who live alone with low incomes ranges from\n$1.2 to $2.7 billion, a relatively small amount. However, the\ncost for people who live with others is more than twice as large,\nPeople who live with others get twice as many hours of help\nper person, independent of need and unmet need. Is the lower\nlevel of help provided to people who live alone a problem?\nActually, people who live alone and whose needs are met are\nTable 6.

Difference between met and unmet need: *p , .05, **p , .01; difference between living alone and living with others:\nno more likely to experience adverse consequences than people\nwho live with others and have their needs met, which suggests\nthat the difference in hours is not a problem. It seems more\nlikely that the difference in hours represents a different\naccounting of help received. After all, among people who live\nalone, helpers come in to the home usually with a set of goals to\nbe achieved in a limited time. It is a different case when the\nperson lives with someone who provides help continuously\nthroughout the day. A different accounting does not imply that\nthe unmet-need shortfall in hours for people who live with\nothers is not real. They do have higher risk of adverse\nconsequences when their needs are unmet, although not as\nextreme as for those who live alone.\nThere are some problems to be dealt with in reducing unmet\nneed for PAS. The potential for greater publicly financed help\nto displace unpaid help has been acknowledged (Kemper, 1992;\nMoscovice, Davidson, & McCaffrey, 1988). Some research\nsuggests that paid services complement, rather than substitute\nfor, unpaid care (Liu, Manton, & Aragon, 2000). The potential\nsubstitution effect is much less an issue for people who live\nalone, only one third of whom are helped by children or\nrelatives, than it is among people who live with others and have\nunmet needs, of whom about 90% are helped by relatives,\nusually a spouse.\nGreater public provision of help to low-income individuals is\nrequired to reduce unmet need among those who live alone, but\nit is not the only remedy for those who live with others. Other\nstrategies may be considered to increase informal hours for\nthose living with others by defraying the personal costs that\nhelpers and their families incur, such as providing tax credits\nfor helpers, and by other financial incentives to foster more\ninformal help. However, these strategies do not focus on unmet\nneed and would provide resources to those whose needs are\nalready being met (or their caregivers) and who have lower risk\nof adverse consequences than those with unmet need.\nFinally, human help is not always the best solution even for\nthose who feel they need it. Trying to eliminate unmet need\nonly by fulfilling people's wishes for more human help, without\nconsidering alternative ways to accomplish activities through\nuse of assistive technology (Verbrugge & Sevak, 2002) and\nenvironmental modification (Lawton, 1982), could result in less\nempowerment, greater learned dependency, and greater societal\nexpense.\nLegal precedents such as the Supreme Court's Olmstead\ndecision (U.S. Government Accounting Office, 2001) and leg-\nislative initiatives such as the Medicaid Community Attendant\nServices and Supports Act (MiCASSA; Harkin & Spector,\n2001) would enable individuals to live in the least restrictive\nsetting they desire. However, such efforts to reduce society's\nreliance on institutions cannot work if individuals' needs are\nnot well met in the community.\nPrevious research, by looking only at the prevalence of\nunmet need for PAS, creates a false impression that unmet need\nis a large and costly problem to resolve. In fact, only 6.6% of all\nneeded hours of help are unmet among adults needing help in\ntwo or more ADLs. The reduction, if not the elimination, of\nunmet need for PAS is a financially achievable goal for the\nnation and one that long-term care policy should focus on.\n"
