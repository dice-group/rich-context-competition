Contrary to common assumptions, belief in conspiracy theories has been prevalent throughout\nhuman history. We first illustrate historical incidents suggesting that societal crisis situations--defined as\nimpactful and rapid societal change that calls established power structures, norms of conduct, or even the\nexistence of specific people or groups into question--have stimulated belief in conspiracy theories. We then\nreview the psychological literature to explain why this is the case. Evidence suggests that the aversive feelings\nthat people experience when in crisis--fear, uncertainty, and the feeling of being out of control--stimulate\na motivation to make sense of the situation, increasing the likelihood of perceiving conspiracies in social\nsituations. We then explain that after being formed, conspiracy theories can become historical narratives\nthat may spread through cultural transmission. We conclude that conspiracy theories originate particularly\nin crisis situations and may form the basis for how people subsequently remember and mentally represent\na historical event.\n",

Since people have a fundamental need to understand why events occurred, particularly in the\ncase of negative or unexpected events (Br\u00fcckmuller et al., this issue), crisis situations often elicit\nsense-making narratives among citizens that become part of their representations of history. Many\nof these narratives take the form of conspiracy theories, commonly defined as explanatory beliefs\nof how multiple actors meet in secret agreement in order to achieve a hidden goal that is widely\nconsidered to be unlawful or malevolent (Zonis and Joseph, 1994). Central to this definition is a\ngroup, or coalition, of powerful and evil-minded individuals, distinguishing conspiracy beliefs\nfrom other forms of belief (e.g. religion, paranormal belief, and superstition). While some con-\nspiracy theories have turned out to be true (e.g. the Watergate and Iran\u00adContra scandals), most\nconspiracy theories in history have no evidence to support them (Pipes, 1997). Well-known exam-\nples of conspiracy theories as explanations of societal crises are allegations that the Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA) was behind the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n(JFK) or that the Bush administration was involved in plotting the 9/11 terrorist attacks (Sunstein\nIn the present contribution, we focus on the role that societal crisis situations play in people's\ntendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the implications of this for how people make sense\nof, and remember, past events. We specifically examine whether, and why, societal crisis situations\nstimulate belief in conspiracy theories. To do so, we integrate historical insights about crisis events\nthat have taken place and stimulated conspiracy theories, with psychological insights about under-\nlying mental processes leading to conspiracy beliefs. In the following, we first examine how preva-\nlent conspiracy theories have been throughout history. Are conspiracy theories mainly a product of\nour modern, digital age, facilitated and perpetuated by Internet and social media? Or, have con-\nspiracy theories been prevalent among citizens throughout history? As a second step, we provide\nexamples in both near and distant history of how crisis situations were intimately connected to the\nappearance of, and widespread belief in, conspiracy theories. As a third step, we describe the\nunderlying psychological dynamics of how crisis situations may stimulate belief in conspiracy\ntheories. As a final step, we explain that once formed, conspiracy theories can stabilize into coher-\nent narratives that influence how people remember, and think about, past events.\nAre conspiracy theories unique to our modern time?\nA common idea among lay people, journalists, and academics seems to be that we now live in an\n\"age of conspiracism.\" To some extent, this assumption is understandable: Conspiracy theories can\nbe found everywhere on the Internet, and statistics reveal that large portions of ordinary citizens\nendorse them for a wide range of topics (Oliver and Wood, 2014; Sunstein and Vermeule, 2009).\nAs a consequence, both authors of this article are regularly approached by journalists who typically\nask whether--or even downright assume that--conspiracy beliefs are \"on the rise\" in our current\nera. But is this actually true? What does the empirical evidence say about the prevalence of con-\nspiracy thinking over time?\nIn an admirable and exceptionally labor-intensive research project, Uscinski and Parent (2014)\nrandomly selected a total of 104,803 published letters that US citizens sent to the New York Times\nand the Chicago Tribune between 1890 and 2010. These researchers, and a team of trained assis-\ntants, coded the letters for conspiratorial content. Each era has its own crisis situations, of course,\nand accordingly the content of specific conspiracy theories varied substantially over time. But\nmore interesting was the prevalence of conspiracy theories: The extent to which these letters\ncontained conspiracy theories fluctuated but did not increase over time. If anything, there were two\nspikes in the data suggesting increased conspiratorial content; however, these spikes were not in\nthe current decade. The first spike occurred shortly before the year 1900, at the height of the second\nindustrial revolution--a period that was characterized by the rise of major companies, quick tech-\nnological progress, and rapidly changing power structures. Such major societal change is a recipe\nfor feelings of insecurity among citizens, particularly those who feel powerless or voiceless\nthat marked the beginning of the Cold War. Many of the conspiracy theories that were ventilated\nduring that period assumed an association between groups or institutions with communism (e.g.\nMcCarthyism). The core conclusion that emerges from these data is that conspiracy theories have\nnot increased over time, and if there ever has been an \"age of conspiracism,\" it is not in the present\ndecade. Uscinski and Parent reason that, insofar as the Internet plays a role in conspiracy theoriz-\ning, its role seems restricted to replacing other means of communication (e.g. word-of-mouth).\nA comparable conclusion emerges from a study by Andeweg (2014), who studied how citizens\nfeel about politicians, political parties, and democracy, within various European Union (EU) coun-\ntries. His study specifically examined whether the trust that people have in politicians and political\nparties, and their satisfaction with the political system, has declined over time. The data on satisfac-\nresults suggest that although across EU member states political trust and satisfaction tend to be\nlow, they are not declining. There have been within-country fluctuations throughout the years, but\nthese fluctuations seem mostly due to specific historical events (e.g. economic recession vs pros-\nperity) and do not reflect structural changes. Although Andeweg (2014) did not directly assess\nbelief in conspiracy theories, measures of trust in, and satisfaction with, politicians have been\nfound to closely predict such beliefs (Abalakina-Paap et al., 1999; Goertzel, 1994). Combined with\nUscinski and Parent's (2014) data, these findings offer little evidence for the proposition that con-\nspiracy theories are unique to our digital age.\nFurthermore, there is also little evidence to support the idea that conspiracy theories are specific\nto Western cultures. Studies have revealed substantial conspiracy theorizing among citizens around\nthe world, including Eastern Europe (Golec de Zavala and Cichocka, 2012), Asia (Mashuri and\n(Zonis and Joseph, 1994). A more plausible conclusion, therefore, is that a tendency to believe in\nconspiracy theories is part of human nature and that people have been susceptible to such beliefs\nthroughout history. We propose a fluid, situational factor to predict such beliefs, namely, the pres-\nence versus absence of crisis situations. As each generation typically faces a range of societal crisis\nsituations, such as revolutions, wars, economic recessions, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters,\nthis would explain why conspiracy theorizing has been prevalent throughout history. Furthermore,\nwhile no research has yet studied cultural differences in conspiracy belief, our line of reasoning\nsuggests that possible cultural differences are likely to be attributable to variations in the extent to\nwhich cultures experience uncertainty and fear (e.g. low- vs high-trust cultures).\nHistorical crises and conspiracy theories\nVarious major crisis events have taken place in recent history, and these events have inspired sub-\nstantial conspiracy theorizing. Only recently, the world has seen economic and financial crises,\nwhich have been associated with various conspiracy theories (e.g. the theory that the financial\ncrisis was caused by democratic bankers to get Obama elected in 2008). Furthermore, our world is\nfacing a crisis pertaining to climate change, which has elicited a climate change denial movement,\nand conspiracy theories, suggesting that climate change is a hoax. Various wars were fought (e.g.\nIraq and Afghanistan), and the motives to participate in these wars have been questioned in con-\nspiracy theories, suggesting a prominent role of oil companies in secret political decision-making.\nFinally, the 9/11 terrorist attacks have produced conspiracy theories, suggesting that the attacks\nwere an inside job or that the US government deliberately failed to prevent the attacks (Dunbar and\nReagan, 2011). Thus, many crisis situations took place, and almost invariably, these crisis situa-\ntions led large groups of citizens to embrace conspiracy theories.\nWhile many conspiracy theories nowadays implicate governmental institutions (e.g. the CIA)\nor major companies (e.g. the pharmaceutical industry), various other societal groups have also\nfrequently been implicated in conspiracy theories. One group that has often been accused of\nconspiracy formation is the Jewish population. Jewish conspiracy theories--suggesting, for\ninstance, that there is a Jewish plot to achieve world domination--still fuel anti-Semitism in\nvarious parts of the world, such as Malaysia (Swami, 2012), Turkey (Nefes, 2015), and Poland\n(Golec de Zavala and Cichocka, 2012). Such conspiratorial anti-Semitism is a recurring issue\nthroughout history. Back in the 1930s and 1940s, Jewish conspiracy theories were a major part\nof Hitler's speeches and a potent force in inspiring the Holocaust (Snyder, 2015). For instance,\nHitler blamed the German defeat in World War I (WWI) on a Jewish conspiracy. Furthermore,\nhe believed that Soviet communism was a Jewish conspiracy, a theory commonly referred to as\n\"Judeo-Bolshevism.\" Somewhat ironically, Joseph Stalin entertained similar conspiracy theo-\nries, suggesting that the Jews were responsible for the rise of Nazism (for details on Jewish\nconspiracy theories shortly before and during World War II (WWII), see Pipes, 1997). Also in\nMedieval times, the European Jewish population was a target of conspiracy theorizing, including\nbeing blamed for setbacks during the Crusades and for causing disease epidemics, such as plague\nEven back in the Roman era, there are prominent examples of conspiracy theories, and these\nare typically connected to major crisis situations. During the year AD 64, the great fire of Rome\nerupted. Aided by the wind and the wooden construction of the houses, the fire lasted for almost\na week, transforming Rome into an inferno. Once the fire stopped, most of Rome was destroyed.\nMany people died or were left homeless. Emperor Nero was out of town when the fire started,\nand he returned to Rome to organize help for the victims. Around the same time, however, con-\nspiracy theories started to spread, which asserted that Nero and his associates deliberately\nstarted the fire in order to rebuild Rome according to his own vision. In addition, these con-\nspiracy theories stated that Nero was singing while Rome was burning (for a more elaborate\ndescription, see Brotherton, 2015). Apparently, Nero was not amused when hearing about the\nconspiracy theories. In response, he came up with his own conspiracy theory, blaming the\nChristian community for initiating the fire and spreading the rumors--leading many Christians\nto be crucified or burned alive.1\nOne might reason that these examples are just anecdotes and think of examples of conspiracy\ntheories that appear unconnected to a specific societal crisis (e.g. the moon landings and the gov-\nernment hiding evidence for intelligent extraterrestrial life). However, while these latter conspiracy\ntheories do not emerge from an objectively \"real\" crisis, they do make assumptions of a powerful\ngovernment that deceives citizens in a deliberate and highly ingenious fashion. Such conspiracy\ntheories therefore still originate from subjective perceptions of a nation being in crisis. More\nimportant for the present purposes is that societal crisis situations almost invariably elicit con-\nspiracy theories. These considerations suggest that conspiracy theories are initiated by the subjec-\ntive thoughts and feelings that people have when confronted with societal crisis situations, such as\na fire, a disease epidemic, a war, a plane crash, or a terrorist strike. In the following section, we\nexamine the psychological literature to answer the question of why conspiracy theories emerge in\nsuch contexts.\nThe psychology of conspiracy beliefs\nWhat psychological function does believing in conspiracy theories have for perceivers, and how is\nthis relevant in crisis situations? Conspiracy theories provide people with simplified answers, spe-\ncifically to questions of how a certain crisis situation emerged, and which societal actors can and\ncannot be trusted. These answers are highly relevant for how people cope with crisis situations.\nCrisis situations are likely to have the psychological effect on people that they become uncertain\nor feel that they cannot control their environment anymore. Conspiracy theories address these feel-\nings by enabling precautionary actions to the alleged conspirators--leading to increased vigilance\nthat may be useful in exposing, combating, or avoiding the conspiracy. Put differently, a conspiracy\ntheory helps people to make sense of the world by specifying the causes of important events, which\nfurther helps them predict, and anticipate, the future. Hofstadter (1966) noted that conspiracy theo-\nries help people comprehend complex events that are difficult to understand otherwise, by attribut-\ning these events to a powerful and evil enemy group. More generally, a desire to make sense of the\nworld is a core motive underlying belief in conspiracy theories (see also Bale, 2007). Such sense-\nmaking is particularly likely to stimulate conspiracy beliefs in a social context that involves hostile\nor ideologically dissimilar outgroups. Such a competitive intergroup setting promotes a need to be\nvigilant, given that the powerful outgroup may cause more harm in the future, and conspiracy\nbeliefs enable perceivers to estimate what the outgroup is capable of.\nIt has been noted that people's motivation to make sense of their environment increases when\nthey feel that they are not in control of a situation or when they experience subjective feelings of\nuncertainty (Van den Bos, 2009). The psychological concepts of lacking control and experiencing\nsubjective uncertainty are closely interrelated, and both describe the aversive experience of being\nin situations where it is unclear what the future may hold. Such experiences are threatening, as\npeople have a basic need to experience a certain level of control over their environment and to\nknow what to expect from that environment. Feelings of control and certainty enable people to\neffectively navigate the world by successfully seizing on opportunities, avoiding threats, and mak-\ning good choices that contribute constructively to one's wellbeing. When people are anxious and\nuncertain, they seek to restore control through enhanced cognitive activity to increase comprehen-\nsion of the situation that they find themselves in (see also Park, 2010). Put differently, when people\nexperience such aversive feelings, they engage in increased sense-making activities in order to\nimbue a situation with meaning and purpose.\nIf belief in conspiracy theories is a way of making sense of a situation, it follows that such\nbeliefs are increasingly likely to the extent that people experience uncertainty or a lack of control.\nThis assertion would provide an explanation for why conspiracy theories emerge in societal crisis\nsituations: People often experience such situations as uncontrollable, and hence, they are a cause\nof substantial uncertainty and anxiety among citizens. Moreover, it is often easy to connect societal\ncrises to the purposeful misdeeds of hostile groups, making it likely that many citizens consider the\npossibility of secret conspiracy formation. In a seminal psychological experiment, one group of\nresearch participants read a scenario where a president was shot and killed. Another group of par-\nticipants read the same scenario with one difference, namely, the assassin missed and the president\nsurvived. Subsequently, participants were asked to what extent they believed that a conspiratorial\nnetwork was behind the attack: Was the assassination (attempt) the work of a lone wolf or of a\nconspiracy? Results revealed that when the president was killed, people were more likely to believe\na conspiracy was behind the attack than when the president survived (McCauley and Jacques,\n1979). Other studies found further support for such \"consequence-cause matching\" in conspiracy\nbeliefs, referring to the idea that people are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories to the\nextent that the consequences of an event are more harmful. For instance, LeBoeuf and Norton\n(2012) found that a political assassination was more likely attributed to a conspiracy if it led to a\nwar than if it did not lead to a war. Such consequence-cause matching in conspiracy beliefs is due\nto an increased motivation to make sense of the event (Van Prooijen and Van Dijk, 2014).\nThese studies suggest that specific impactful societal events--such as the assassination of a\npresident--produce specific conspiracy theories (i.e. about the assassination). Feelings of uncer-\ntainty, and the fear of being out of control, also appear to predict a more general tendency to\nexplain events that happen in the world through conspiracy theories, however, including conspir-\nacy theories that are conceptually unrelated to the source of uncertainty (e.g. Kossowska and\nBukowski, 2015). For instance, research suggests that people who have a relatively strong external\nlocus of control--which is a structural tendency to attribute one's own successes and failures to\nfactors that are out of one's own control--are more likely to report high levels of interpersonal\nmistrust, paranoia, and belief in conspiracy theories (Hamsher et al., 1968; Mirowsky and Ross,\n1983). Likewise, people who feel powerless are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories\n(Abalakina-Paap et al., 1999; Imhoff and Bruder, 2014), as are people who strongly experience\nThe above-mentioned findings are correlational, and hence, these studies do not reveal whether\nuncertainty causes conspiracy beliefs, or vice versa. In experimental psychological research, how-\never, researchers have attempted to establish causality: Does the experience of lacking control, or\nsubjective feelings of uncertainty, increase belief in conspiracy theories? To examine this question,\nvarious studies have attempted to induce these feelings in research participants. An example is a\nstudy by Whitson and Galinsky (2008), in which one group of research participants wrote down a\npast experience where they felt that they personally lacked control. Compared to other partici-\npants--who had written about a less threatening experience--these participants were subsequently\nmore likely to believe in conspiracy theories that were unrelated to the out-of-control experience\n(for other illustrations, see Sullivan et al., 2010; Van Prooijen and Acker, 2015). Likewise, other\nstudies asked participants to describe a situation in their life where they felt uncertain. Such an\nuncertainty induction subsequently increased belief in conspiracy theories about various societal\nissues, provided that the relevant authorities were considered immoral (Van Prooijen and Jostmann,\n2013; see also Van Prooijen, 2016). Taken together, these findings suggest that lacking control, or\nsubjective uncertainty, often increases people's tendency to believe in conspiracy theories.\nThe relationship between uncertainty and conspiracy beliefs has substantial implications for\nunderstanding how people psychologically cope with adversity in their everyday life. For instance,\nCrocker et al. (1999) investigated conspiracy beliefs among societal minority groups (i.e. African\nAmericans). Their findings reveal that minority group members who face real problems--such as\nracial discrimination--are more likely than majority group members to attribute these problems to\nconspiracies. Furthermore, Van Prooijen and De Vries (2016) investigated organizational conspir-\nacy beliefs: What factors predict whether or not employees suspect their managers of conspiring\ntoward evil goals? Results of their study revealed that feelings of job insecurity--that is, uncer-\ntainty about whether one's job will continue to exist in the future--was a main predictor of such\norganizational conspiracy beliefs (see also Douglas and Leite, 2016, for studies on conspiracy\nbeliefs in organizations). These findings underscore that in a variety of settings, subjectively expe-\nriencing uncertainty or powerlessness is a recipe for conspiracy beliefs.\nWhile conspiracy beliefs are a response to anxiety and uncertainty, it is not a given that they\nactually help to reduce such feelings. In fact, research reveals that exposure to conspiracy theories\nincreases feelings of powerlessness, which, in turn, leads to a variety of maladaptive behavioral\nintentions, such as withdrawal from politics, a decreased willingness to reduce one's carbon foot-\nprint (in response to climate conspiracy belief), and a decreased willingness to have a child vacci-\nnated (in response to vaccine conspiracy beliefs; Jolley and Douglas, 2014a, 2014b; see also\nDouglas and Sutton, 2015). Conspiracy theories also appear to influence people without their\nawareness (Douglas and Sutton, 2008). We speculate here that conspiracy theories are likely to\nhave some psychological payoff for perceivers, for instance, by reassuring them that harmful inci-\ndents do not occur at random, thereby enabling them to prepare for the dangers entailed by the\nsuspected conspiracy. At the same time, believing that the world is filled with evil conspiracies is\nlikely to invoke a host of negative emotions, which may help explain why belief in one conspiracy\ntheory stimulates belief in other conspiracy theories (Goertzel, 1994; Wood et al., 2012).\nIn sum, belief in conspiracy theories is intimately connected with feelings of fear, uncertainty,\nor being out of control, and it is likely that societal crisis situations often arouse such feelings in\npeople. As such, these insights can explain why conspiracy theories flourish particularly in societal\ncrisis situations. The main underlying process for this connection is that uncertainty stimulates a\ndesire to make sense of one's social environment.\nImplications for historical narratives\nWhat are the implications of these psychological processes for how people remember and transmit\ninformation about past events? Here, we propose that while conspiracy theories may originate\nthrough the emotional processes of lacking control or feeling uncertain, at a relatively fast pace\nthey can become coherent narratives that shape people's representations of history (see also Hilton\nand Liu, this issue). The feature of conspiracy theories that they summarize complex events into a\nsimplified story--typically involving a powerful enemy group (i.e. the conspiracy) that deliber-\nately organizes and carries out an evil plan-- makes such theories ideally suited for cultural trans-\nmission as they are easily understood by lay people (see Bilewicz et al., this issue; Bruckm\u00fcller\net al., this issue). It has been noted that people typically make sense of past events as \"lay histori-\nans\" who--unlike professional historians--rarely base their conclusions on direct historical\nsources. Instead, lay historians transmit historical narratives to others based on their imperfect\nmemory, as well as on other imperfect sources of information such as folklore, novels, films, and\nAs a consequence, conspiracy theories may spread over time and become part of people's men-\ntal representations of important historical events, long after the feelings of uncertainty and fear that\nthe events initially caused have dissipated. A case in point is the assassination of JFK on 22\nNovember 1963 in Dallas, Texas. This event produced an instant shock in the United States and,\nindeed, in the entire world. For many people, the JFK assassination continues to be a \"flashbulb\nmemory,\" as they still know exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first\nheard the news (see also Luminet and Spijkerman, this issue). The event also gave rise to major\nconspiracy theories, making allegations that powerful groups such as the CIA, the KGB, Cuba, or\norganized crime were behind the assassination. Various polls suggest that ever since this event took\nplace, the majority of US citizens have believed in one of the conspiracy theories about this event\nOf particular interest for the present purposes is how the proportion of citizens that endorsed a\nJFK conspiracy theory has developed over time. Longitudinal Gallup polling revealed that, in the\n3years directly after the assassination, slightly more than 50% of US citizens believed that JFK\nhad been murdered as part of a conspiracy (see Swift, 2013, for an overview of these Gallup\npolls). It stands to reason that, after these first few years, the uncertainty and fear that were caused\nby the Kennedy assassination had dissipated among the public. There were various other societal\ncrises going on to worry about (e.g. the Vietnam War; substantial societal changes, such as those\ninitiated by civil rights movements). Nevertheless, the proportion of citizens that believed in a\nJFK conspiracy theory gradually increased over the years, reaching a high of 81% in 1975. In the\nfollowing years, up until 2003, these proportions remained consistently above 70% and peaked\nagain at 81% in the early 2000s. Only in recent years these numbers have started to decrease,\nalthough they are currently still above 60%--which is higher than directly after JFK assassination\nWhile uncertainty and fear may have contributed to the genesis of JFK conspiracy theories back\nin 1963, it is difficult to account for these numbers through these emotional processes. There has\nbeen variation in the number of crises throughout the past few decades that citizens encountered\n(e.g. economic recession vs prosperity; war vs peace), but this waxing and waning of societal crises\nare not visible in the Gallup figures (Swift, 2013). Furthermore, taking into account that the figures\nare very high also in recent years, it is quite likely that many people who were not even born in\n1963 endorse a JFK conspiracy theory. Instead, we propose that conspiracy theories can become\ncoherent historical narratives that are transmitted to future generations as if they were facts, even\nif the actual facts do not provide compelling evidence for the conspiracy theory. What starts as a\npsychological response to cope with distressing feelings can become part of people's representa-\ntions of history.\nNot all conspiracy theories make history this way, and in fact, the plausibility that people accord\nto certain conspiracy theories can also decrease over time as a function of new insights. For\ninstance, it was common for citizens to believe that many young women conspired as witches with\nthe Devil back in the seventeenth century, and this conspiracy theory in all likelihood emerged\nthrough similar processes as other conspiracy theories discussed in this article. Nevertheless, it is\na safe guess that few modern European citizens would endorse such beliefs today (although com-\nparable witchcraft conspiracy theories are still common in other parts of the world, for example,\nparts of Africa; West and Sanders, 2003). In a similar vein, we can only speculate as to how JFK\nconspiracy theories will develop in the future--particularly when the final classified documents\nabout this incident are released to the public. Be that as it may, our conclusion is that while con-\nspiracy theories are initially based on the emotional experiences associated with imminent crisis\nsituations, they may soon after stabilize into coherent narratives that are part of how people remem-\nber the past.\nConcluding remarks\nThis contribution sought to examine the relationship between societal crisis situations and belief in\nconspiracy theories. Building on an integration of historical observations with basic psychological\nresearch, we can draw the following conclusions. First, conspiracy theories are not unique to our\ncurrent time or culture. People of all eras and cultures are likely to believe in conspiracy theories,\nprovided that they are confronted with societal crisis situations. Second, this relationship between\nsocietal crisis situations and belief in conspiracy theories is attributable to feelings of fear, uncer-\ntainty, and being out of control. These feelings instigate sense-making processes that increase the\nlikelihood that people perceive conspiracies in their social environment. Third, after being formed,\nconspiracy theories can become part of lay representations of history and are transmitted to new\ngenerations as coherent narratives even though people do not experience uncertainty about past\ncrisis situations anymore. Taken together, these processes might explain why human history is\nreplete with widespread belief in conspiracy theories.\n"
