    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBackground In the USA, consumption of moist snuff\ncontinues to increase and cigarette manufacturers now\ncontrol nearly its entire market. Manufacturers have\ndeveloped new products that represent cigarette brand\nextension and in test marketing are promoting dual use\nof cigarettes and snuff. This study examined patterns of\nconcurrent use of smokeless tobacco (ST) and cigarettes\namong young people and adults in the USA just before\ncigarette companies' control of the nation's ST market.\nMethods Data were drawn from four US nationally\nrepresentative surveys. Stratified analyses applied\nsampling weights and accounted for the complex sample\ndesigns.\nResults Cigarette smoking was substantially more\nprevalent among young males who used ST than among\nthose who did not. Among adult males, those who\nsmoked daily were less likely than others to have used\nsnuff every day. Men who used moist snuff daily had the\nlowest prevalence of daily smoking, but the prevalence\nof daily smoking was relatively high among men who\nused moist snuff less than daily. Unsuccessful past-year\nattempts by daily smokers to quit smoking were more\nprevalent among non-daily snuff users (41.2%) than\namong those who had never used snuff (29.6%).\nConclusions Although dual daily use of ST and\ncigarettes is relatively uncommon in the USA, concurrent\nST use is more common among adolescent and young\nadult male smokers than among more mature tobacco\nusers. Among adult males, daily smoking predominates\nand non-daily ST use is very strongly associated with\ncurrent smoking. Adult male smokers who also use ST\ndaily tend to have relatively high levels of serum cotinine\nand high prevalence of a major indicator for tobacco\ndependence.\nBACKGROUND\nSmokeless tobacco (ST) products include chewing\ntobacco, dry snuff and moist snuff. Consumption\nof chewing tobacco in the USA decreased from 47\nmillion to 36 million pounds, and dry snuff from\nconsumption of moist snuff increased from 61.5\nmillion pounds to 77.4 million pounds.1 Recently,\ncigarette and ST manufacturers have introduced\na drier form of moist snuff called snus (20% mois-\nture content vs 50% in traditional moist snuff),\nwhich is packaged in a pouch, often flavoured, and\nplaced in the upper lip to reduce spitting. Snus has\ngained popularity among boys and men in Sweden,\namong whom its prevalence of use is greater than\ncigarette smoking.2\nFor decades, the US ST market was dominated\nby a small number of companies that sold only ST\nand had no financial interest in selling cigarettes.\nThat situation changed with the acquisitions of the\nConwood Company in 2006 by Reynolds Amer-\nican, Inc3 and the US Smokeless Tobacco Company\n(USSTC) in 2008 by Altria Group, the parent\ncompany for Philip Morris USA.4 Cigarette\ncompanies have also introduced new ST products,\nincluding moist snuff and snus, sold under cigarette\nbrand names such as Marlboro and Camel. The\nrecent entry by the cigarette industry into the US\nST market, and expanded promotion of existing and\nnew ST products, may have far-reaching public\nhealth implications. This new development has the\npotential to encourage increased ST use among\nyoung people and dual use of ST and cigarettes\namong smokers, while slowing reductions in\nsmoking prevalence and undermining cessation.\nFew studies have been conducted regarding the\nextent of dual use of ST and cigarettes in the\nUSA,5e8 and none has examined detailed patterns\nacross multiple population-based data sources. The\npurpose of this study was to examine patterns of\nconcurrent use of ST and cigarettes among young\npeople and adults in the USA. The data were\nprimarily collected before the recent acquisitions of\nthe US ST companies by cigarette manufacturers,\nand the analyses therefore may be viewed as\na baseline measure of the extent of dual product use\njust before the entry of the major cigarette compa-\nnies into the nation's ST market. The analysis\nfocused specifically on snuff, where possible. It also\nanalysed levels of serum cotinine and markers of\nnicotine addiction such as time to first cigarette\nafter waking among exclusive smokers and dual\nproduct users. Because use of ST in the USA is\nrelatively rare among females, all analyses in this\nstudy were limited to males.\nMETHODS\nData sources\nData for this study were drawn from four US\nnationally representative surveys. We include four\ndata sources because each survey has its particular\nstrengths and limitations and no single data source\nadequately covers the full range of ages and vari-\nables related to dual use of cigarettes and ST. For\nexample, the Current Population Survey Tobacco\nUse Supplement provides extensive detail on\ntobacco use, but is not anonymous and does not\ninclude people under age 16. School-based surveys\nsuch as the Monitoring the Future Study and the\nNational Youth Tobacco Survey are anonymously\n1Department of Community\nDentistry and Behavioral\nScience, University of Florida\nCollege of Dentistry, Gainesville,\nFlorida, USA\n2Department of Society, Human\nDevelopment, and Health,\nDivision of Public Health\nPractice, Harvard School of\nPublic Health, Boston,\nMassachusetts, USA\nCorrespondence to\nDr Scott L Tomar, Department of\nCommunity Dentistry and\nBehavioral Science, University of\nFlorida College of Dentistry,\nUSA; stomar@dental.ufl.edu\nPublished Online First\nThis paper is freely available\nonline under the BMJ Journals\nunlocked scheme, see http://\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com/site/\nabout/unlocked.xhtml\nResearch paper\nadministered and reach younger people but provide more limited\ndetail on pattern of tobacco use. In addition to self-reported\ndata, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\ncollects biological specimens that enables measurements such as\nserum cotinine levels, but has a limited sample size for subgroup\nanalyses. These surveys use different sampling schemes, metho-\ndologies and questions to collect data on tobacco use and other\nvariables included in this study. The sources and variables\nexamined are briefly summarised below.\nCurrent Population SurveydTobacco Use Supplement\nThe US Bureau of the Census and the US Bureau of Labour\nStatistics have conducted the Current Population Survey (CPS)\nfor more than 50 years to assess employment in the USA (US\ntp-66.pdf). The sample is drawn from the US civilian, non-\ninstitutionalised population age 15 years or older. Data are\ncollected monthly through household interviews. Questions on\ntobacco use were added as a National Cancer Institute-sponsored\nTobacco Use Supplement (TUS) to the monthly CPS in May and\navailable at this time. Data for those 3 months were combined\nand used to produce national estimates. Although CPS includes\nboth self-reported and proxy-reported data, analysis in this study\nincluded only self-reported data. Further information on the CPS-\nTUS is available at: http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/studies/tus-cps/.\nMonitoring the Future Survey\nSupported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse,\nthe University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research has\nsurveyed nationally representative samples of high school seniors\nin the spring of each year since 1975 as part of the Monitoring the\nFuture (MTF) Survey.9 Beginning in 1991, surveys also have been\nconducted among 8th- and 10th-grade students. Multistage\nsampling designs were used to randomly select students in public\nand private schools within the 48 contiguous states. Self-\nadministered questionnaires were distributed to students in\nclassrooms by trained personnel, and standardised procedures\nwere followed. This report uses MTF Survey data from public use\nsurvey is available elsewhere.9\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a programme of studies conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics to assess the health and nutritional\nstatus of adults and children in the USA. As part of the NHANES,\nvenepuncture is performed to collect a blood sample from each\nparticipant. The blood samples are subsequently assayed for\na wide range of biochemical substances, including cotinine,\na major metabolite of nicotine and a biomarker for nicotine\nexposure. The NHANES is designed to be representative of the\ncivilian, non-institutionalised US population. The analyses in this\nolder. Further details on NHANES are available at http://www.\ncdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.\nNational Youth Tobacco Survey\nThe National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) has been conducted\nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1999 to\nprovide estimates of current use of tobacco products among US\nmiddle school and high school students. The NYTS uses anony-\nmous, self-completed survey instruments administered to\nstudents in a multi-stage probability sample of public and private\nschools and classes. Further information on the NYTS is available\nat: http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/NYTS/\nindex.htm. This study included data from the 2006 NYTS.\nAnalysis\nEach of the datasets was analysed for a number of parameters\nrelated to dual use of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes, including\n< The prevalence of smoking, by smokeless tobacco use status\n< The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use status, by smoking\nstatus\n< Number of cigarettes smoked per day by daily smokers, by\nsmokeless tobacco use status\n< Sociodemographic characteristics of dual users\n< Indicators of nicotine addiction, by smoking and snuff use\nstatus\n< Interest and attempts to quit smoking among daily smokers,\nby snuff use status\n< Biochemical markers of nicotine exposure, by smoking and\nsnuff use status.\nMost analyses involved bivariate contingency tables, generally\nstratified by demographic characteristics such as age or grade in\nschool. All datasets included in this study used complex sample\ndesigns and applied sampling weights to account for differential\nprobabilities of selection and participation. Therefore, all statis-\ntical analyses were conducted on weighted data by using SAS and\nSUDAAN software packages. p Values are reported for some\nspecific comparisons of means or proportions, and we reported\nstandard errors for estimated means and proportions to allow\nreaders to calculate confidence intervals for those estimates.\nRESULTS\nYoung people\nPatterns of dual use\nand 21.0% of male high schools students smoked on at least one\nof the 30 days preceding the survey (table 1). The prevalence of\ncigarette smoking was substantially higher among young males\nwho used ST than among those who did not. For example, in the\nday also smoked during the preceding 30 days; 53.8% smoked\nevery day. The pattern was similar for male high school students\nin the NYTS: about 60% of those who used ST in the past\n30 days also smoked, compared to 17% of those who did not use\nST. Although there were relatively few high school males in any\nMTF Survey (data not shown) who used ST daily had a much\nhigher prevalence of smoking one-half pack of cigarettes or more\nper day (10.8%) than did those who did not use STat all (1.3%).\nThe pattern was even more pronounced among 10th grade male\nstudents: 22.7% of daily ST users also smoked one-half pack of\ncigarettes or more per day, compared with 8.8% of less-than-daily\nST users and 1.7% of those who did not use ST at all. Males in\n12th grade who used STon a daily basis did not differ appreciably\non the prevalence of smoking one-half pack or more per day\n(22.8%) from those who used ST but less than daily (25.9%), but\nthe prevalence of smoking one-half pack of cigarettes or more per\nday was about five times greater among ST users than among\nstudents and 9.5% of male high school students used ST on at\nleast one of the 30 days preceding the survey (table 2). STuse was\nsubstantially higher among young males who smoked than\namong non-smokers. For example, 27.7% of male middle school\nstudents who smoked daily during the preceding 30 days also had\nResearch paper\nused ST during that time period, compared to 1.6% of those who\nhad not smoked during the preceding 30 days. Differences\nbetween lighter smokers and heavier smokers in the prevalence of\nST use were more pronounced among students in higher grades\nthan in lower grades. For example, in grade 8 in the 2006 MTF\nSurvey, 24.8% of males who smoked at least one-half pack of\ncigarettes per day also used ST during the preceding 30 days,\nwhile in grade 12 the corresponding prevalence was 40.8% (data\nnot shown).\nAdults\nPatterns of dual use\n16.0% smoked daily and 3.8% smoked on a non-daily basis\n(table 3). Men who used snuff on a daily basis had the lowest\nprevalence of daily smoking (7.3%), compared to 14.9% of men\nwho had never used snuff, 37% of those who used snuff but less\nthan every day and 29.1% of former snuff users.\n0.6% of daily smokers also used snuff every day, compared to\n2.9% of non-daily smokers, 1.9% of former smokers and 1.3% of\nnever smokers (table 4).\nSelected sociodemographic characteristics of male daily\nsmokers aged 25 years or older, by snuff use status, were analysed\nproduct users were younger (mean \u00bc 42.45 years) than daily\nDaily smokers who also used snuff on some days were\nsignificantly younger (mean \u00bc 38.58 years) than daily dual users\nnever users (p < 0.00001). Nearly all dual product users were\nwhite and were not of Hispanic ethnicity. Dual product use was\nmost common in the southern region of the USA, including\n53.6% of daily smokers who also used snuff daily and 45.2% of\nthose who used snuff occasionally, compared to 38.0% of male\ndaily smokers who had never used snuff. Dual product users also\nwere over-represented in non-metropolitan areas. Among male\ndaily smokers, the prevalence of concurrent snuff use was highest\nWest Virginia (5.6%) (data not shown).\nSerum cotinine levels\nData on serum cotinine levels among male daily smokers were\nExamination Survey. Although the estimates are based on rela-\ntively small sample sizes, daily smokers who also used ST every\nday smoked about the same mean number of cigarettes per day as\ndid daily smokers who used ST on some days or had never used\nST (table 5). Daily dual product users had a significantly higher\nmean serum cotinine level than daily smokers who used ST on\nsome days or never used it.\nSmoking dependence and cessation\nTable 6 presents data on a key indicator of tobacco dependence10\nST use status.

Past-year quit\nattempts were more prevalent among non-daily snuff users\n(41.2%) than among daily smokers who had never used snuff\n(29.6%) That group also expressed a significantly greater\ndegree of interest in quitting than did daily smokers who did not\nuse snuff.\nDISCUSSION\nBased on data from four large, US nationally representative\nsurveys of young people or adults, the association between\nsmokeless tobacco use and cigarette smoking is complex. The\nprevalence of smoking is generally quite high among men who\nuse snuff on a less-than-daily basis and among former snuff\nusers, while the prevalence of smoking is relatively low among\nmen who use snuff every day. The pattern is quite different for\nyoung people: the prevalence of daily smoking is very high\namong male students in middle school and high school who use\nsmokeless tobacco. This pattern is consistent with findings from\nan earlier US nationally representative prospective cohort study,\nwhich found that early dual users largely moved towards ciga-\nrette smoking later in life.11\nA number of indications in this study reflect a potentially\ntroubling pattern of smoking associated with non-daily ST use:\n`some day' snuff users are more likely to be current daily smokers\nthan any other group, and daily smokers who also use snuff on\nsome days expressed greater interest in quitting smoking than\nthe other groups but were more likely than any other group to\nhave had unsuccessful quit attempts in the preceding year. This\npattern of tobacco use may represent a partial substitution of\nsmoking and a prolonging of dependence. Conversely, it is\npossible that smokers who have had unsuccessful quit attempts\nsubsequently turned to snuff as a cessation strategy. Under-\nstanding the reasons for dual use clearly requires further research.\nAlthough dual daily use of ST and cigarettes is relatively\nuncommon, that pattern is more common among adolescents\nand young adults than among more mature tobacco users.\nAlthough male dual daily users tend to smoke fewer cigarettes per\nday than male daily smokers who do not use snuff or use it less\nthan daily, they tend to have the highest levels of serum cotinine\nand exhibit among the most prevalent indicator of dependence.\nInterestingly, daily smokers who also used snuff on\na non-daily basis had serum cotinine levels that were essentially\nequivalent to those of daily smokers who never used snuff,\nalthough there was no significant difference in the number of\ncigarettes they smoked per day. It is not known whether that\npattern reflects their infrequency of snuff usage, greater\ncompensation among smokers whose only source of nicotine\nwas cigarettes, biological factors such differences in nicotine\nmetabolism, or the relatively imprecise estimates that resulted\nfrom small sample sizes.\nThe landscape of tobacco use is rapidly changing in the USA.\nPer capita cigarette consumption has reached its lowest point in\nmore than 60 years,12 smoking among high school students is at\nits lowest level since tracking began9 and smoke-free indoor\nregulations continue to proliferate.13 14 However, sales of moist\nsnuff in the USA continue to increase each year.1 In stark\ncontrast to the situation that existed in the USA until 2006,\nwhen almost the entire smokeless tobacco market was controlled\nby companies that did not manufacture cigarettes, cigarette\nmanufacturers now control virtually the entire US snuff market.\nThere is no indication that the major tobacco companies are\nplanning to abandon cigarette manufacturing; on the contrary,\nthey appear to be positioning traditional and new types of ST\nproducts as complements and as situational substitutes for\ncigarettes.15 The most recently available data suggest that dual\nproduct use is primarily concentrated in regions and subpopula-\ntions of the USA where ST use has been relatively prevalent for\nmany yearsdfor example, young males in southern and\nTable 5 Mean number of cigarettes smoked per day and mean serum\ncotinine level among male daily cigarette smokers* aged 20 years or\nolder, by smokeless tobacco use status\nSmokeless\ntobacco\nuse\nUnweighted\nsample size\nCigarettes per\nday\nSerum cotinine\n(ng/ml)\nMean SE Mean SE\n*Excludes persons using cigars, pipes, or nicotine replacement pharmacotherapy.\nySignificantly greater than some day smokeless tobacco use or never used smokeless\nzSignificantly greater than some day smokeless tobacco use (p\u00bc 0.01) or never used\nTable 6 Prevalence of selected indicators of addiction and quit\nattempts among of male daily smokers aged 25 years, by snuff use status\nIndicator of addiction or quitting/snuff\nuse status\nUnweighted\nsample size\nPercentage\nor mean SE p Value\nQuit smoking one or more days in past\nSeriously considering quitting smoking\nwithin next 6 months\n*Respondents were asked to rate their level of interest in quitting smoking on a scale from\n1e10, where 1 \u00bc not at all interested and 10 \u00bc extremely interested.\nySignificantly higher than for those who never used snuff, p\u00bc 0.0026.\nzSignificantly higher than for those who formerly used snuff, p\u00bc 0.025.\nxSignificantly higher than for those who never used snuff, p\u00bc 0.0072.\n{Significantly higher than for those who never used snuff, p\u00bc 0.046.\n**Significantly higher than for those who never used snuff, p\u00bc 0.0005.\nyySignificantly higher than for those who never used snuff, p\u00bc 0.0067.\nzzSignificantly higher than for those who formerly used snuff, p\u00bc 0.0001.\nResearch paper\nAppalachian states, northern plain states and in non-metropol-\nitan areas. With tobacco companies such as Reynolds American,\nPhilip Morris USA, Liggett and Lorillard focusing their test\nmarketing efforts on areas with large college student popula-\ntions, such as Columbus, Ohio and Austin, Texas and large urban\nareas with recent smoke-free indoor air laws, such as Indian-\napolis, Portland and Orlando,16e18 dual use of cigarettes and ST\nmay become more prevalent in other regions.\nOur findings are consistent with other US studies on dual use\nof STand cigarettes. An earlier analysis of 1998 National Health\nInterview Survey data also found a high prevalence of smoking\namong men who used ST on some days, and indications that\nsome men were using ST as a way to quit smoking.5 Similar to\nYouth Tobacco Surveys found that a large proportion of young\npeople who smoked also used other tobacco products.8 An earlier\nstudy of dual product users also reported profound levels of\ntobacco dependence.19 The present study extends these previous\nstudies by examining these patterns in greater detail across\nmultiple age groups and modes of data collection.\nThere are several limitations inherent in the use of the data-\nsets analysed for this study. First, all of the studies used cross-\nsectional designs, which limits the ability to examine longitu-\ndinal patterns of transition between usage of tobacco products.\nDifferences in patterns of dual use between young people and\nadults may reflect birth cohort effects, and future patterns of\ntobacco use among adults may differ as today's young people\nprogress through life. In addition, all surveys, with the exception\nof NHANES, rely only on self-report to estimate prevalence and\nconsumption of tobacco products. Self-reported levels of tobacco\nconsumption may be prone to error.20e22 However, such\nmeasurement error would be expected to be non-differential with\nrespect to use of other tobacco productsdfor example, we have\nno reason to believe that smokeless tobacco users would differ\nfrom non-users in the accuracy of the their reported daily ciga-\nrette consumption. Non-differential measurement error would\ntend to attenuate the strength of association between smokeless\ntobacco use and cigarette smoking.\nIn conclusion, analyses of data from four nationally repre-\nsentative surveys indicate that dual use of cigarettes and ST is\nrelatively common among young males. The pattern is different\namong adult males, among whom daily smoking predominates\nand non-daily snuff use is very strongly associated with current\nsmoking. Adult male smokers who also use snuff tend to have\nrelatively high levels of serum cotinine and high prevalence of\na major indicator for tobacco dependence. The major US ciga-\nrette companies now control nearly the entire US smokeless\ntobacco market and aggressively promote dual product use,\nwhich may portend a lessening in the decline in smoking,\nincreased dual use, perpetuation of dependence and continued\nhigh levels of tobacco related death and disease.\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to thank the reviewers for their helpful\nsuggestions on an earlier version of this manuscript.\nFunding This study was supported by National Cancer Institute grant R01CA87477\n(GNC, principal investigator).\nCompeting interests SLT serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs in product litigation\nbrought against cigarette and smokeless tobacco manufacturers.\nEthics approval This study was approved by the institutional review boards of Harvard\nUniversity and the University of Florida Health Science Center.\nContributors All authors included on this paper fulfil the criteria of authorship.

The prevalence of smoking is generally\nquite high among adult males who use snuff on a less-than-daily\nbasis and among former snuff users, while the prevalence of\nsmoking is relatively low among men who used snuff every day.\nThe study also found that adult male daily smokers who also use\nsnuff on some days expressed greater interest in quitting\nsmoking than other groups but were more likely than any other\ngroup to have had unsuccessful quit attempts in the preceding\nyear. Although male dual daily users tend to smoke fewer\ncigarettes per day than male daily smokers who do not use snuff\nor use it less than daily, they tend to have the highest levels of\nserum cotinine and exhibit among the most prevalent indicator of\ndependence. The association between smokeless tobacco use\nand cigarette smoking is complex, and aggressive marketing of\nmoist snuff by cigarette manufacturers may lead to unpredict-\nable and undesirable public health outcomes.\nWhat is already known on this subject?\nIn the USA, cigarette smoking is declining, consumption of moist\nsnuff is increasing and cigarette manufacturers now control\nnearly the entire moist snuff market. Manufacturers have\ndeveloped new products that represent cigarette brand exten-\nsion and are promoting dual use of cigarettes and snuff.
