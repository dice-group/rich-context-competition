    "abstract": "Abstract\nIt is popular to attribute the appearance of extended colour fields to a process of filling-in from the\ndifferential colour signals at colour edges, where one colour transitions to another. We ask\nwhether such a process can account for the appearance of extended colour fields in natural\nimages. Some form of colour filling-in must underlie the equiluminant colour Craik\u00adO'Brien\u00ad\nCornsweet effect and the Watercolour Effect, but these effects are too weak to account for the\nappearance of extended colour fields in natural images. Moreover, the graded colour disappearance\neffect reported as evidence for colour filling-in does not work under natural viewing conditions.\nWe demonstrate that natural images do not look very colourful when their colour is restricted to\nedge transitions. Moreover, purely chromatic images with maximally graded (edgeless) transitions\nlook fully colourful. Consequently, we conclude that colour filling-in makes no more than a minor\ncontribution to the appearance of extended colour regions in natural images.\n",

Solomon\nCity University of London, London, UK\n Keywords\ncolour, contours/surfaces, filling-in, perceptual organization\nThere is fairly widespread acceptance of the notion that extended fields appear colourful\nmore from colour filling-in from the colour changes at the edges of the field than from the\ninherent colour of the field itself (Gerrits & Vendrik, 1970; Kanai, Wu, Verstraten, &\nThompson, & Noe\n\u00a8 , 1998). At least this idea is the basis for many computational analyses\nof colour processing (e.g. Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985; Ma & Manjunath, 2000). The\nargument proceeds from the proposal by Craik (1966), O'Brien (1958) and Cornsweet\n(1970) that lateral inhibition reduces or eliminates the neural response to uniform fields,\nleaving as the most salient features the edges, or regions of rapid luminance change in the\nimage. (The lateral inhibition is considered to be implemented neurally by surround\ninhibition balancing the centre activation of typical neural receptive fields.)

To be fair, the\nmaximum range of chromatic modulation in terms of cone contrast is only about 15%\n(Cavanagh, Tyler, & Favreau, 1984); so a 0.5% luminance effect could translate to about\n3.5% of the full range of chromatic modulation, but this still leaves 96.5% of the perceived\nchromaticity of extended 100% colour fields to be accounted for.\nAlong similar lines, colour filling-in is the conceptual basis of the `Watercolour Effect' of\nPinna (1987), in which colour is indeed seen to propagate across the white spaces between the\ndouble lines of two contrasting colours (Figure 1, left panel). (Interestingly, the strength of\nthe effect is dependent on both the line wiggliness and the luminance difference between the\ncolours, as illustrated by the straight-line, equiluminant version in Figure 1, right panel.)\nPinna, Brelstaff, and Spillmann (2001) report that its strength increases with the spatial\nfrequency of the wiggliness of the coloured borders, although perfectly straight borders\nalso induced a notable effect, as seen in Figure 1 in a figure/ground configuration.\nHowever, they do not offer any explanation for the wiggliness effect. Pinna, Werner, and\nSpillmann (2003) describe the role of a range of Gestalt factors in the effect, but do not\ninclude straight-line versions in their analysis. Thus, it is undeniable that there is a colour\nfilling-in mechanism operating in human perception, and as such is deserving of a full\nanalysis of what neural mechanisms could account for the immediate propagation of edge-\ndefined colour across extensive spatial regions (Komatsu, 2006). However, though spatially\nextensive, the colour effect is markedly unsaturated, so we raise the question whether it can\naccount for the normal range of colour perception of extended surfaces or is a minor tweak\non the full scope of colour processing.\nA primary argument against the logic of colour filling-in as a general phenomenon is that\nmany colour-selective receptive fields typically do not exhibit surround inhibition (for review,\nsee Komatsu, 2006). Moreover, there is little or no evidence for lateral inhibition in the colour\ndomain. Colour modulation does not elicit the type of low frequency fall-off in either the\nFigure 1.

These lines of evidence give every reason to expect only a minimal filling-in\nprocess to operate in the colour domain. We ask whether, even if colour filling-in operates\nunder laboratory conditions, it is an effective operating mode for the viewing of natural\nimages. It seems most natural to answer this question under natural viewing conditions of\nfree eye movements.\nThis argument against colour filling-in was, however, challenged by a demonstration by\nKrauskopf (1963) and others that an `edgeless' blurred red disk within an equiluminant green\ndisk could disappear under stabilized image conditions, with the green appearing to invade the\nred region to fill it in as a uniform green disk. Examples of such a stimulus are shown in Figure 2\nat two scales, both in the original colours and in a blue\u00adyellow version (on the grounds that the\nlatter should perhaps be more vulnerable to colour filling-in because the S-cones coding\nthe blue\u00adyellow colour contrast are about a factor of 10 less dense than the other cones in\nthe retina). It is clear from the images in Figure 2 that, under natural observation conditions\nwith free eye movements, there is no significant reduction in the colour of the blurred centre\nrelative to the sharp-edged surround, even with the steadiest fixation effort. Under natural\nviewing conditions, then, there seems to be no substantial colour filling-in for the Krauskopf-\ntype `edgeless' colour stimulus. This too was noted by Krauskopf. It may be possible to\napproximate Krauskopf's mechanical stabilisation with exceptionally stable fixation for 20 s\nor more, but this is a manifestation of general adaptation at low spatial frequencies, reducing\nthe already limited contrast sensitivity below the colour discrimination threshold. It is\nFigure 2. Krauskopf style `edgeless' red and yellow colour disks in roughly equiluminant green and blue\nsurrounds, respectively, at two size scales. Steady fixation fails to eliminate the colour gradient under normal\nviewing conditions.\nNote: With prolonged steady fixation and transfer to a blank test field, the complements of the inner colours\nare again fully visible in the afterimages, despite the fact that afterimages are by definition stabilized on the\nretina. This implies that the Krauskopf filling-in is a version of the Watercolor Effect at the low effective\ncontrast produced by stabilization, which is ineffective for the high effective contrast afterimages.\nTyler and Solomon 3\ntherefore clear that the green and blue edges do not propagate their colours into the centres of\nthe fields under conditions of normal saccadic exploration.\nThe images in Figure 2 are artificial images, but the main question of this article is whether\ncolour filling-in might operate in natural images under more natural viewing conditions,\ngiven the complexity of their edge structures, mixture of chromatic and luminance edges\nand contextual richness. For a direct assessment of colour filling-in in natural images, we\nchose a colourful macaw image. The base equiluminant stimulus was generated by the\nprocedure shown in Figure 3. In the first column are the original image (upper panel),\nwith the greyscale information extracted by setting the colour contrast to zero (lower\npanel). Subtracting the greyscale image contrast in each colour channel from the original\nproduced the equiluminant colour image of the second column (upper panel). Setting the\ncolour contrast of this equiluminant image to zero without changing its luminance contrast\n(second column, lower panel) verified that there was minimal residual luminance contrast.\nNow, although this luminance subtraction procedure generated an equiluminant image, it\nis evident that the colour contrast is not equal everywhere \u00ad in particular, the reds and blues\nin the feathers are much more saturated than the greens and yellows in the background. In an\nattempt to equate the colours across space, we therefore raised the intensity of the green\nchannel to the point where it provided a perceptual match to the brightness of the other\ncolour channels (third column, upper panel) and repeated the same sequence of operations\nfrom the first quartet in the remaining three panels. It can be seen that the resulting\nequiluminant, balanced image now has much more uniform colour contrast throughout,\nand that its residual luminance image still has minimal contrast energy. While we did not\nattempt quantification of these matches, we relied on visual assessment to come close to a\nperceptual match, and to verify that the residual luminance contrast energy is essentially\nundetectable.\nTo evaluate the question of colour filling-in, therefore, we need a high-pass spatial\nfrequency version of the equiluminant, balanced contrast colour image of Figure 3,\nFigure 3. Generation of an equiluminant, balanced contrast colour image (see text). Figure Credit:\nas provided in the extremely high-pass image of Figure 4 (left panel) filtering the 512x512-\npixel image with a 2D Gaussian filter that dropped to 1/e at 7.5 pixels. It can be seen that the\nimage appears as narrow lines of high contrast colour with predominantly uniform grey\nbetween them (although there may be a hint of perceived colour as expected from the\nWatercolour Effect). It is evident, therefore, that the colour borders per se are not\nsufficient to provide for the full-colour impression of the original image.\nNow, it could be argued that full-colour equiluminant images are not very natural, even\nwhen derived from a natural image. It seemed prudent, therefore, to re-introduce the\nachromatic information back into the image to see if there was some interaction between\nit and the high-pass colour information that could provide for some colour filling-in. The\neffect of this manipulation is shown in Figure 4 (right panel). It is clear that the effect of the\nluminance information is, if anything, to mask the colour information rather than to induce\nfilling-in, as the colour appears more vivid in the high-pass equiluminant colour image than\nin the presence of the luminance information.\nIn addition to subtracting the full achromatic image from the chromatically balanced\nimage (Figure 4), we also subtracted progressively more blurred versions of the chromatic\nimage from itself, leaving progressively more of the mid-frequency chromatic information\nequiluminant, balanced colour image was filtered with a 2D Gaussian filter that dropped\nto 1/e at 15, 30, 60 pixels to provide the very, moderately and mildly high-pass filtering,\nrespectively. It can be seen that the image of the first column still looks like narrow lines of\nhigh contrast colour with predominantly uniform grey between them (although there is some\nincrease of colour as expected from the Watercolour Effect). In the last two columns, there is\na noticeable spread of the colour towards the centre of the smaller regions, but they do not\nlook anything like the full-frequency equiluminant colour image of Figure 3 (fourth column,\nupper panel), and it is difficult to distinguish any perceptual spread from the actual image\nFigure 4.

If there is some degree of colour filling-in, it is not the process responsible for the\nfull-colour perception of such an image.\nIn the lower panels of Figure 5, adding the high-pass equiluminant versions to the\ngreyscale image does seem to make the colour look noticeably more uniform in the\npresence of the luminance information (lower panels) than in the equiluminant colour\nimages (upper panels). This leads us to the suggestion that colour filling-in can be slightly\nenhanced by the natural forms of luminance contrast in natural images, although whether\nthis is a true filling-in process or an effective reduction in colour contrast by luminance\nmasking/gain control mechanisms remains unclear.\nOne objection to this analysis might be that the equiluminant balancing procedure departs\nfrom the unbalanced nature of the colour across natural images in general, and that colour\nfilling-in might be more effective for unbalanced colour edges. To address this point, we\ninclude a further figure of the colour edge manipulation for the unbalanced equiluminant\ncase from Figure 3 and four other diverse natural images (Figure 6). It is evident that only the\nsmallest colour patches at the scale of the filter show pronounced colour percepts. For more\nextended regions, any filling-in is markedly incomplete relative to the full-colour versions,\nFigure 5. Upper panels: High-pass spatial frequency versions of the equiluminant, balanced contrast colour\nimage of Figure 3 (fourth column, upper panel) at three further high-pass cutoffs.

Figure\nproviding further support for the contention that colour-edge filling-in is not the primary\nmechanism for our colour perception in natural images.\nThe Role of Spatial Frequency\nA final issue is the role of spatial frequency in colour processing. It is generally understood\nthat colour processing, as represented by the visibility of equiluminant colour images, is\nlimited to much lower spatial frequencies than luminance processing (National Television\nthe frequency and contrast-modulated gratings in Figure 7, in which maximum contrast\nappears along the horizontal centre line, the resolution limit for black and white is only\nabout twice as high as that for red/green modulation (van der Horst, de Weert, &\nBouman, 1967; Anderson, Mullen, & Hess, 1991). Results for yellow/blue modulation are\nmore variable (Ahumada, Wuerger, & Watson, 2002), but appear to be similar to that for\nred/green in this configuration. (Care must be taken to ensure that the coloured images are\nviewed in clear focus, as the focal plane may be different for the optimal viewing of each\ncolour.) This novel configuration is designed to eliminate any sharp edge information, either\nluminant or chromatic, from which the interior grating could be reconstructed by a filling-in\nprocess. Thus, any colour percept of deviation from the average gray has to derive from the\nlocal interior information within each bar of the swept gratings, rather than by propagation\nfrom edge information.\nFigure 6. The chromatic edge information for a diversity of natural images (top row) shown as the raw\n(non-balanced) colour edges at the `very high-pass' level of 1/e \u00bc 15 pixels in the 512 \u00c2 512 images (middle\nrow), and added to the unfiltered luminance information (bottom row). Although full colour is seen for\nfeatures at the scale of the high-pass filter (as in the turquoise car and Carol Channing's red hat lanyard), there\nis rather little percept of filling-in across larger coloured regions in these natural images.

This observation implies that the colour is\nperceived sui generis, solely on the basis of the available colour gradients in the sinusoidal\nmodulations, as exemplified by Figure 7. It is not clear how colour filling-in proponents\nwould account for the colour impressions of such sinusoidal colour modulation, but our\nview is that it leaves at best a minimal role for any such nonlinear chromatic processing.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflict of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAnderson, S.
