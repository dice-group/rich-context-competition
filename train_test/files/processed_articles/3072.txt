Favoritism to-\nward senior faculty (eg, in the form of a university \"blind eye\"\nto abuses) is probably a major factor in many of the problems\nsurrounding authorship. In a sense, it sends the message that \"crime\npays.\"\nI am also concerned that legal issues of intellectual property\nwere not discussed. The meaning of authorship in the academic\nsense seems quite different from authorship in the legal sense.\nUniversities are not above the law. They are subject to US and\ninternational laws on intellectual property, such as copyright and\npatent law. These laws make it clear that only tangible, written\nwork is copyrightable and that the person who creates the tan-\ngible expression \"owns\" the work (holds the copyright) unless\nwork-for-hire or other legal co-owner agreements apply.2\nI suggest that one way to clear up the controversies over in-\ntellectual property and accreditation is for universities to bring\ntheir policies in line with the law of the land and to enforce such\npolicies firmly, fairly, and uniformly.\nScot Silverstein, MD\nChristiana Care Health System\nWilmington, Del\n1.

Copyright Law of the United States of America, Ownership of Copyright Act,\nIn Reply: One can agree with Dr Silverstein's sentiments with-\nout necessarily coming to the same conclusions regarding the most\npractical ways to address authorship problems. My own institu-\ntion makes significant efforts to provide effective redress for those\nwho feel they have been treated unfairly in an authorship dis-\npute. Both formal grievance procedures and informal actions\n(through the ombudsman's office) are available as alternatives to\nnormal departmental channels. Nevertheless, the reality is that\nthe master-journeyman-apprentice system of medical research\nmakes it possible for retaliation against whistle-blowing to take\nplace, often years later. It would be irresponsible and unfair to\nstate that formal procedures can guarantee complainants that there\nwill be no ill effects of their bringing such disputes to light.\nFormal policies for redress and protection are essential tools\nfor promoting fair treatment. Sensitivity to legal rights and re-\nquirements is very important, as Silverstein suggests, but insuf-\nficient. That is why I suggest a 3-pronged approach of formal poli-\ncies, informal confidential dispute resolution tools such as an\nombudman's office, and better training of laboratory and depart-\nment heads to protect against a culture in which unfair assign-\nment of credit is tolerated.\nLinda Wilcox, EdM, CAS\nHarvard Medical School, School of Dental Medicine\nand School of Public Health\nBoston, Mass\nCORRECTIONS\nIncorrect Wording: In the Original Contribution entitled \"Management of Pain in\nElderly Patients With Cancer\" published in the June 17, 1998, issue of THE JOURNAL\nOn page 1877, under \"Results\" in the abstract, the fourth sentence should have\nread \"Patients aged 85 years and older were less likely to receive morphine or other\npage 1880, in the first column, the last sentence should have read \"Patients aged\n85 years and older received morphine or other strong opiates one third less fre-\nAuthor's Name Misspelled: In the A Piece of My Mind entitled \"Don't Call Me\n1385), the author's name was misspelled.
