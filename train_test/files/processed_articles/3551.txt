    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current study sought to answer three key questions about explaining the emotion of regret in the domain of casual sex: Are\nsex differences in sexual regret robust or attenuated in a highly egalitarian culture? What proximate psychological variables might\nexplain sex differences in sexual regret? And what accounts for within-sex variation in experiences of sexual regret about casual\nsex. We conducted a study of 263 Norwegian students (ages 19\u00ad37) who reported how much they regretted having either\nengaged in, or passed up, their most recent casual sexual experience. Sex differences in sexual regret are not attenuated in this\nsexually egalitarian culture. The study revealed sex differences in worries about pregnancy, STIs, and reputation; however, these\npredictors did not succeed in accounting for the sex differences in regret engaging in casual sex. Sexual gratification and socio-\nsexual orientation both predicted the sex differences in casual sex regret. In contrast, only socio-sexual orientation attenuated\nthe sex difference in regret passing up casual sex. Predictors of within-sex variation in casual sexual regret included worry about\nsexual reputation, experienced gratification during the encounter, and socio-sexual orientation. Discussion focuses on implica-\ntions for the psychological design features of this relatively neglected emotion.\n",

Buss2\n Keywords\nSexual regret, worry, sex differences, sociosexuality, orgasm\nThe emotion of regret has gained increasing attention from an\nevolutionary perspective (e.g., Galperin et al., 2013; Roese\net al., 2006). Given the centrality of sex to reproduction, a good\ncase can be made that sexual conduct is a particularly important\ndomain for experiencing regret. Prior research has found that\nalthough women and men tend not to differ in their experiences\nof regret in general, a major exception occurs within the roman-\ntic and sexual domains. Roese et al. (2006) found that men and\nwomen did not differ in their regrets about having had sex but\nmen, more than women, regretted missed sexual opportunities\nin the past. Eshbaugh and Gute (2008) reported that reproduc-\ntive sexual acts (intercourse) predicted regret in women after\nsexual hookups, while nonreproductive sexual acts such as oral\nsex did not predict regret. These findings have been interpreted\nas being consistent with parental investment theory (Trivers,\nRecently, Galperin et al. (2013) hypothesized that regret, or\nanticipated regret, may be an evolved emotional\u00adcognitive\nevaluation mechanism serving the specific function of avoiding\npast errors in decision-making, thus improving future decision-\nmaking, in this case about sexual decisions.\nAlthough both sexes sometimes experience regret about\ncasual sex decisions, following the logic of sexual strategies\ntheory (Buss & Schmitt, 1993), they differ in which aspects of\ncasual sex that they regret (Galperin et al., 2013). This is due to\nselective pressures ultimately stemming from a large asym-\nmetric difference in obligatory parental investment. Men and\nwomen are expected to differ in which casual sex decisions\nthey regret more--having had casual sex with the wrong part-\nner versus passing up casual sexual opportunity. Because errors\nin sexual decisions are typically costlier for women, women are\nhypothesized to regret sexual actions that involve making a\npoor sexual partner choice or having sex in unpropitious\n1 Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology,\nTrondheim, Norway\n2 Department of Psychology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLeif Edward Ottesen Kennair, Department of Psychology, Norwegian\nUniversity of Science and Technology, 7491 Trondheim, Norway.\nEmail: kennair@ntnu.no\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/evp\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\ncircumstances. Conversely, men are hypothesized to regret\nmissed casual sexual opportunities more than women because\nhistorically a man's reproductive success was constrained pri-\nmarily by the number of fertile women to whom he could gain\nsexual access. Both hypotheses have received empirical sup-\nport, with results showing a moderate effect for having had\ncasual sex (women regret more; Fisher, Worth, Garcia, &\npassing up sexual opportunities (men regret more; Galperin\nPossible Proximate Explanations of Sex Differences\nin Casual Sexual Regret\nWhat proximate mechanisms may account for these observed\nsex differences? Galperin et al. (2013) offer two possible, not\nmutually exclusive, alternative explanations: (1) differences in\nworry about consequences in the aftermath of sex, such that\nwomen worry more about pregnancy, and (2) differences in\nsexual gratification experienced during the sexual encounters\nsuch that men, on average, experience greater gratification than\nDespite the low risk, becoming pregnant following casual\nsex historically (and perhaps currently) has been costlier for\nwomen than for men. This would cause women to worry more\nabout casual sex encounters and cause them to regret casual sex\nmore than men (Galperin et al., 2013). Other research has\nshown on-average sex differences bearing on these proximate\nexplanations: Women tend to worry more than men and are\nmore troubled by ruminative mental processing (Nolen-\n2009). Conversely, this might conceptualized as men being\nmore hypophobic and risk-taking (Kennair, 2007; Kruger &\nbecoming pregnant following casual sex might be less relevant\nin populations where hormonal contraception use is common\n(e.g., female students in most Western societies and our popu-\nlation in particular; Gr\u00f8ntvedt, Kennair, & Mehmetoglu, 2015).\nOn the other hand, hormonal contraception does not protect\nagainst sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and worry about\ncontracting STIs might therefore pose a relevant problem. Men\nalso engage in more risky sexual behavior and contract more\nSTIs than women (Courtenay, 2000)--maybe as a result of less\nworry about STIs. Further, due to sexual double standards\n(Buss, 2013), even in a sexually liberal Western culture such\nas Norway (Gr\u00f8ntvedt & Kennair, 2013), where the current\nstudy was performed, worry about sexual reputation might be\nstronger among women than among men. Therefore, in addi-\ntion to Galperin et al.'s (2013) suggestion that female-specific\nworry about pregnancy might influence casual sex regret, we\nsuggest that increased worry among women about contracting\nSTIs or incurring a negative sexual reputation following casual\nsex might be possible explanations of sex differences in sexual\nregret (Campbell, 2008). These explanations, of course, are not\nmutually exclusive--one or some combination of them could,\nin principle, explain the sex differences.\nA number of studies on sex-related preferences, desires, and\ninterests find that men have stronger interest in sex, enjoy sex\nmore, are more easily stimulated and aroused, and are more\nopen to casual sex than women (Ellis et al., 2008; Kennair,\nSchmitt, Fjeldavli, & Harlem, 2009; Meltzer, McNulty, &\nwomen find casual sex less physically gratifying, they will tend\nto regret sexual experiences more than men. However, how\nmuch and in what ways physical gratification during casual sex\ninfluence sex differences in sexual regret remains to be exam-\nined, although suggestive data reveal that quality of sexual\nexperience may be linked to sexual regret (Fisher et al., 2011).\nIn addition to attempting to explain between-sex differ-\nences, another key goal of the current study is to examine\nindividual differences in sexual regret. Individual differences\nin regret have received little empirical attention. Individual\ndifferences in regret may plausibly be linked with sociosexu-\nality, a personality characteristic shown to be strongly sex dif-\nferentiated, with men being less restricted across all studied\ncultures (Schmitt, 2005). Scoring high on the behavioral\ndimension of sociosexual orientation reflects more frequent\ncasual sex and a broader range of different sexual experi-\nences, thus giving an individual more opportunities to expe-\nrience sexual regret (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). On the\nother hand, short-term strategists may experience less sexual\nregret because casual sex is more congruent with their pre-\nferred sexual strategy. Those who are easily aroused by extra-\nrelational partners and new encounters, characteristics of high\nscorers on revised Sociosexuality Orientation Inventory\n(SOI-R; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008), should experience less\nregret in the aftermath of casual sexual. In addition, no pre-\nvious studies have yet considered how individual differences\nin worry and physical gratification may be linked to individual\ndifferences in regret.\nThe Current Study\nThe first goal of the current research is to examine whether\npreviously documented sex differences in sexual regret can be\nreproduced in a sexually liberal, secularized, and highly egali-\ntarian culture, since social role theory predicts that this key\nfeatures of cultures can dramatically influence the presence\nor absence of psychological sex differences (Bendixen, 2014;\n2007). Norway together with other Scandinavian countries dur-\ning the last years have been ranked among the top nations on\nthe Global Gender Gap Report (World Economic Forum,\n2016). In comparison, the United States was recently ranked\n45. In addition, Scandinavian countries are ranked among the\nleast religious (Gallup, 2010) and among the most sexually\nliberal (Scott, 1998) as reflected by attitudes toward premarital\nsex, extramarital sex, and homosexuality. If social role theories\nabout monomorphic psychology, and specifically sexual psy-\nchology, are correct, findings of sex differences in U.S. popu-\nlations will not replicate or be diminished in more egalitarian\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\ncountries, and we should not find similar patterns of sex dif-\nferences in sexual regret in Norway. Second, we seek to test\nalternative hypotheses about different proximate explanations\nthat may account for the sex differences in regret engaging in\ncasual sex, notably worry about consequences in the aftermath\nof casual sex and physical gratification experienced during\ncasual sex. The third goal is to examine the extent individual\ndifferences in sociosexuality may account for sex differences in\nsexual regret.\nWe tested the following hypotheses and research question:\nHypothesis 1: Women will regret having had casual sex\nbut according to social role theory, this sex difference will\nbe attenuated in a highly sexually egalitarian culture.\nHypothesis 2: Men will regret passing up casual sex more\naccording to social role theory, this sex difference will be\nattenuated in a highly sexually egalitarian culture.\nHypothesis 3: Women will worry more about casual sex\nconsequences (pregnancy, STIs, and reputation) than men,\nand worry will account for sex differences in casual sex\nHypothesis 4: Women will experience less physical grati-\nfication from casual sex than men (pleasure, orgasm, and\norgasm importance) and gratification differences will\naccount for sex differences in casual sex regret (Fisher\nHypothesis 5: Women will have more restricted sociosexu-\nality than men (Schmitt, 2005), and sociosexuality differ-\nences will account for sex differences in casual sex regret.\nExplorative research questions. We also wish to examine predic-\ntors of individual differences of sexual regret (for men and\nwomen separately). Specifically, we will explore (1) whether\nworries (about pregnancy, STIs, and sexual reputation), phys-\nical gratification during casual sex, and sociosexual orientation\naffect within-sex variance in regrets about having had casual\nsex and regrets about passing up sexual opportunities and (2)\nwhether the factors that affect regrets are similar or different for\nmen and women.\nMethod\nSample and Design\nStudents attending different lectures at the Faculties of Social,\nNatural, and Human Sciences of a Norwegian University\nresponded to a four-page questionnaire on sexual regret. A total\nreporting on their most recent casual sex incidence were eligi-\nble for analyses. Mean ages for women (n \u00bc 168) and men (n \u00bc\nSixty-one percent of the women and 66% of the men reported\nrelationship status as ``single.''\nProcedure\nTwo research assistants, one male and one female, gave a short\noral presentation of the study, ``a study of sexual experiences\nand regret'' during a lecture break. Instructions read: ``The\npurpose of this survey is to gain more knowledge on possible\nsexual regret among students. The study is part of a larger\ncollaboration among Norwegian and American researchers.''\nParticipants were informed of the content of the questionnaire\nand were then invited to participate. Participation was fully\nvoluntary and the students were assured that their responses\nwould remain completely anonymous. Responding was done\nduring the 15-min lecture break. No personal identification was\nto be written on the questionnaire. Completed questionnaires\nwere folded and returned to a box at the podium. No course\ncredit was given for participation.\nMeasures\nOutcome variables\nCasual sex regret. We included, from Galperin et al. (2013), 2\nglobal items on regrets related to the most recent casual sex\nincidence: (1) regretting having had casual sex and (2) regret-\nting passing up casual sex. Participants responded to the fol-\nlowing alternatives: Not applicable--I haven't done this (not\ncoded), I'm glad I did it (coded 0), neutral--neither glad nor\nhave regrets (coded 1), I regret it somewhat (coded 2), and I\nregret it very much (coded 3).\nPredictors. In addition to sex, age, and relationship status, the\nbelow predictors were analyzed.\nWorry. Six items were developed for measuring worries fol-\nlowing most recent casual sex incident and general worries\nfollowing casual sex. Three separate aspects of worry included:\n(1) becoming pregnant (or partner becoming pregnant), (2)\ncontracting STIs, and (3) sexual reputation. Participants rated\ntheir level of worry on a 5-point Likert-type scale with high\nscores reflecting more worry.\nPhysical gratification. Six items were developed measuring\nphysical gratification in relation to most recent casual sex inci-\ndent and general gratification in relation to casual sex. Three\nseparate aspects of gratification were included: (1) general sex-\nual pleasure, (2) whether one achieved an orgasm, and (3) the\nsubjective importance of orgasming. Participants rated their\nlevel of sexual pleasure, regularity of orgasm achieved, and\norgasm importance using a 5-point Likert-type scale with high\nscores reflecting more gratification.\nSociosexuality. Participants completed the SOI-R (Penke &\nAsendorpf, 2008). Internal consistency was good for the 9-item\nmeasure (a \u00bc .86) as well as for each of the three components:\nSOI\u00adBehavior (a \u00bc .86), SOI\u00adAttitudes (a \u00bc .81), and SOI\u00ad\nDesire (a \u00bc .89). The three components correlated moderately\n(r's between .32 and .49) were treated as separate predictors\nthroughout the analysis.

The pattern was significantly\nBefore testing whether sex differences in engaging or pass-\ning up casual sex regret could be accounted for by variables\nrelated to worry following casual sex, casual sex gratification,\nor sociosexuality, we need to examine the strength of sex dif-\nferences in these possible moderators. For the worry measures,\nsex differences in the theory-expected direction were signifi-\ncant for two of the three aspects (see Table 2). In general, the\nsex effect was small to moderate as indexed by the Cohen's d\nstatistic. Further, sex differences in the theory-expected direc-\ntion were evident for all three aspects of physical gratification\nwhen having casual sex. The sex differences were particularly\nstrong for the orgasm measures, each showing large effect\nsizes. Sex differences in the theory-expected direction were\nevident for the three dimensions of sociosexuality.\nAre Sex Differences in Regrets Following the Most Recent\nCasual Sex Incident Accounted for by Worry Following\nCasual Sex, Physical Gratification During Casual Sex,\nor Sociosexuality?\nFor predicting regret engaging in casual sex and regret passing\nup causal sex, respectively, we performed ordered logistic\nregression analyses. This statistical technique is applicable\nunder the assumption that the levels of the dependent variable\nhave a natural ordering (low to high), but the distances between\nadjacent levels are unknown (http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/\nstata/output/stata_ologit_output.htm). Demographic predictor\nvariables were sex (women vs. men), age (continuous), and\nrelationship status (single vs. paired). The remaining additional\npredictor variables were entered in separate models: Model 1,\nworry (pregnancy, STI, and reputation); Model 2, physical\ngratification (sexual pleasure, orgasm achieved, and orgasm\nimportance); and Model 3, sociosexuality (behavior, attitudes,\nand desire). Initial analyses suggested that being single or being\npaired did not affect either casual sex or passing up casual sex\nregrets and revealed no Sex \u00c2 Relationship Status interaction\neffects. Consequently, relationship status was omitted from the\nfurther regressions.\nPredicting casual sex regret from participant sex and age\nshowed that men were significantly less likely to regret than\nrelative to women, men's likelihood of regretting was 0.44 and\nwomen's likelihood of regretting was 2.27 times that of men.\nRelative to younger participants, older participants regretted\nThe effect of participant sex and age accounted for 3.0% of the\nTable 1.

Adding the\nthree worry items (Model 1) did not affect the effect of parti-\ncipant sex and age. Men and older participants still regretted\nless. As shown in Table 3, participants who worried more about\ntheir reputation following the most recent causal sex incident\nregretted significantly more, while worries about pregnancy or\nsexually transmitted diseases did not affect casual sex regret.\nHowever, a marginal Sex \u00c2 Worry interaction effect (Z \u00bc\n\u00c01.79, p \u00bc .074) suggests that the effect of reputation worry\nmay be moderated by participant sex. The zero-order correla-\ntion was stronger for women (r \u00bc .30) than for men (r \u00bc .01).\nIn Model 2, we added the three physical gratification items\nto the effect of sex and age. The effect of sex was significantly\nreduced and no longer significant (Z \u00bc \u00c01.73, p \u00bc .084, OR \u00bc\n0.58), while the effect of age remained significant. As can be\nseen from Table 2, higher reported level of sexual pleasure was\nsignificantly associated with less regret and higher level of\norgasm importance was associated with more regret. The latter\nfinding is most likely an artifact because all three physical\ngratification items were negatively associated with regretting\ncasual sex when analyzed individually. They all individually\nsignificantly reduced the sex effect to nonsignificant levels.\nHowever, none of the effects of the physical gratification items\nwere moderated by participant sex (Sex \u00c2 Gratification inter-\nactions were all nonsignificant).\nIn Model 3, we added the three sociosexuality indexes to the\neffect of sex and age. As seen from Table 3, sociosexuality\naccounted for all the sex difference in sexual regret, but older\nparticipants still regretted less than younger participants. Parti-\ncipants scoring high on SOI\u00adAttitudes and SOI\u00adDesire\nreported significantly less regret. These effects were not mod-\nerated by participant sex (none of the interactions were\nsignificant).\nWithin-Sex Predictors of Regretting Having Had\nCasual Sex\nTo investigate which of the variables included in the three\nmodel above may account for women and men's regrets enga-\nging in casual sex, we ran regression analyses separately for\nwomen and men controlling for age and omitting all insignif-\nicant effect from the separate models. The final model con-\ntained four predictors that accounted for 14.1% of the\nvariance in women and two predictors accounting for 13.2%\nof the variance in men. The significant predictors for women\nwho worry more about their reputation, who have low physical\ngratification and who have a restricted sociosexuality are more\nlikely to regret casual sex. For men, the significant predictors\nwho experience less physical gratification and who have a\nrestricted sociosexuality (low on desire) are more likely to\nregret casual sex.\nPossible Ways Physical Gratification and Sociosexuality\nAccount for Sex Differences in Regretting Casual Sex\nGiven the exceptionally strong associations between partici-\npant sex and measures of physical gratification and sociosexu-\nality, it is unsurprising that a lion's share of sex differences in\ncasual sex regret disappears when controlling for the effects of\nthese factors statistically. Therefore, a meaningful framework\nfor interpretation is warranted. To provide further insight into\nTable 3.

Age was not significantly\nrelated to regretting having passed up casual sex, Z \u00bc 0.63. Sex\nand age accounted for 9.1% of the variance in regret passing up\ncasual sex. Adding the 3 items on general, worry in Model 1 did\nnot affect the participant sex effect. Participants who generally\nworried more about their sexual reputation following casual sex\nwere less likely to regret passing up casual sex. This effect was\nnot moderated by participant sex, and the remaining worry items\ndid not affect regretting having passed up casual sex.\nIn Model 2, we added the 3 items on general physical grat-\nification when having had casual sex previously. The effect of\nsex was not affected by the inclusion of general physical grat-\nification (log odds remained identical, but the standard error\nincreased). Of the three predictors, only sexual pleasure\naffected regretting sexual opportunities passed up. Participants\nwho reported more general sexual pleasure in relation to casual\nsex were more likely to regret passing up (OR \u00bc 1.44). Impor-\ntantly, this effect was not moderated by participant sex.\nWhen we added the three sociosexuality indexes to the\neffect of sex and age in Model 3, the effect of participant sex\nwas reduced. Still, even when controlling for individual differ-\nences in sociosexuality, men were more than 3 times more\nlikely to regret passing up casual sex. As evident from Table\n4, participants with attitudes condoning casual sex were signif-\nicantly more likely to regret passing up. This effect was partly\nmoderated by participant sex, Z \u00bc \u00c02.01, p < .05 (stronger for\nwomen than for men). Apparently, those who had more casual\nsex regretted passing up sexual opportunities less than those\nwith few casual sex experiences but only when accounting for\nSOI\u00adAttitudes. The zero-order correlation for SOI\u00adBehavior\nwas very close to 0 (r \u00bc \u00c0.01) and similar for women and men.\nWithin-Sex Predictors of Regretting Passing Up\nCasual Sex\nTo investigate which of the variables included in the three mod-\nels above may account for women and men's regrets passing up\nFigure 2.

The final model came out with only\ntwo predictors that accounted for 13.5% of the variance in\nwomen and one predictor accounting for 3.5% of the variance\nin men. For women and men, general worry about sexual repu-\ntation following causal sex decreased the likelihood of regretting\npassing up the most recent opportunity. For men, this variable\nwomen unrestricted sociosexuality (SOI\u00adAttitudes) produced\nlower likelihood of regretting passing up (OR \u00bc 1.91, Z \u00bc\n4.47, p < .001), essentially accounting for the effect of worry\nthe general gratification variables affected the likelihood in\nwomen or men for regretting passing up casual sex.\nDiscussion\nWe found that men more than women regret passing up casual\nsexual opportunities; women more than men regret having had\ncasual sex. This replicated the pattern of findings from\nGalperin and colleagues (2013), supporting the evolutionary\nhypotheses about sex differences in sexual regret. The study\nalso provides a modest test of a competing theory to explain\nthese sex differences--social role theory (Buss & Barnes,\nsex differences will be attenuated or entirely absent in sexually\negalitarian cultures. Direct comparison of the effect sizes with\nthose reported by Galperin et al. (2013) reveal that the sex\ndifferences in sexual regret show no diminution in this highly\nsexually egalitarian culture. This adds to a growing body of\nfindings that fail to support the social role explanation for sex\nBendixen, Kennair, Ringheim, et al., 2015; Fernandes, Ken-\nnair, Hutz, Natividade, & Kruger, 2015; Gr\u00f8ntvedt & Kennair,\n2013; Kennair, Nordeide, Andreassen, Str\u00f8nen, & Pallesen,\nAs expected, women worried more than men about having\nhad casual sex (Hypothesis 3, part 1), but these sex differences\nwere generally modest, and much smaller than for sociosexual\norientation and from physical gratification from sex. Galperin\nand colleagues (2013) suggested that women's increased worry\nabout pregnancy might account for sex differences in casual\nsex regret. We considered two other domains of worry--worry\nabout sexual reputation and worry about STIs and neither\naccounted for the sex difference. Hence, we found no support\nfor the second part of Hypothesis 3.\nGalperin et al. also hypothesized that women's increased regret\nabout experiencing casual sex may be due to less sexual gratifica-\ntion experienced in these sorts of encounters. We did find than\nwomen reported markedly lower levels of physical gratification\nfrom casual sex (statistically fully accounting for the sex differ-\nence), but sexual gratification showed similar association with\nregret about having had casual sex for both women and men. Men\nhave less regret and higher gratification than women, but individ-\nualswithineachsexshowthe same pattern.Inshort,thehypothesis\nthat sex differences in casual sex regret are due to women experi-\nencing less sexual gratification than men was not supported.\nThere were very clear sex differences in SOI. The differences\nwere largest for the attitude and desire subscales of SOI. SOI\nshowed a similar association with casual sex regret within each\nsex. Men have a less restricted SOI, and thus less regret, but\nthose men with the most restricted SOI scores show the most\nsexual regret. The same pattern is found for women: Unrestricted\nwomen report less regret; restricted women report most regret.\nAlthough SOI accounted for the sex difference in regret statis-\ntically, any hypothesis that sex differences in casual sex regret is\ndue to individual differences in sociosexuality is questionable.\nWheninvestigatingsexdifferences,oneneedstoavoidnaively\ncontrolling for other fundamental aspects of being male or being\nfemale. Anything that is highly correlated with sex, when statis-\ntically controlled, will remove any statistical effect of sex. As an\nanalogy, when predicting sex differences in upper body muscle\nmass, statistically controlling for height would remove any effect\nof sex--the proverbial throwing the baby out with the bath water.\nConcluding that there is no effect of sex after controlling for SOI\nor physical gratification would therefore be misguided (Schmitt\net al., 2012). Abundant evidence suggests that the large sex dif-\nferences in these variables are evolved sex differences--men's\nshort-term mating looms larger in their motivational priorities\nInternational Sexuality Description Project, 2003).\nWorrying more about reputation, experiencing less sexual\npleasure, having low levels of sexual desire, and expressing\nattitudes disapproving of uncommitted sex all predicted\nhigher levels of casual sex regret for women. For men, low\nlevels of sexual pleasure and desire predicted casual sex\nregret. The novel model of understanding sex differences\nwe present in this article suggests that there are fundamental\nsex differences in casual sex decisions that are attenuated or\nintensified in a similar manner by largely similar processes for\nboth men and women.\nPredicting regret associated with having passed up casual\nsex opportunities beyond the effect of biological sex is murkier.\nDespite a general expectation that this would to a large degree\nmirror factors related to regret of having had casual sex, we did\nnot hypothesize about the outcomes. Biological sex is the prin-\ncipal predictor in regretting passing up sexual opportunities;\nmen are far more likely than women to regret passing up casual\nsex. General worry about sexual reputation in relation to casual\nsex predicted lower levels of regret passing up in both sexes,\nbut for women, unrestricted attitudes accounted for most of this\neffect. A possible interpretation of this could be that there was\nan association between less sex-typical responses. Apparently,\nwomen whose sexual strategy attitudes are less restricted expe-\nrience more regret about passing up sexual opportunities com-\npared to sexually restricted women.\nStudy Limitations and Future Research\nFour possible limitations can be identified in this study. First,\nthe nature of the cross-sectional design does not allow to\nKennair et al. 7\ndirectly address or to make strong inferences about what factors\nmay cause sexual regret. However, we believe the inclusion of\na number of proximate predictors in the study allows for a\nbetter understanding of psychological processes influencing\nsexual regret in men and women. Second, the reliabilities of\nour measures of worry and physical gratification remain\nunknown as single items were applied for these proximate\npredictors. Future studies may benefit from multiple item\nscales. Third, although the use of student samples usually rep-\nresents obvious limitations with regard to generalizations to\nother populations, the close reproduction of central methodo-\nlogical aspects of Galperin et al.'s study (including the outcome\nvariables and the type of sample) allows for a more direct\ncomparison of the sex effects across samples. Finally, to\naddress effects of gender egalitarianism on sexual regret, we\nneed to add data points from several cultures, including cul-\ntures/nations ranking in the lower end on gender equality\nindexes. Obviously, merely testing in one extra culture is not\nenough to address the overall effect of culture on sexual regret.\nOn the other hand, no similarity between Galperin et al.'s\n(2013) and the current findings would have weakened the idea\nthat sex differences in sexual regret are universal. The similar-\nity we found weakens social role theory.\nFuture research could expand the search for proximate psy-\nchological predictors of sexual regret. First, although we\nassessed worry about sexual reputation, STIs, and pregnancy,\nfuture work could explore those who have actually experienced\nthese negative sequelae of casual sex. Do people who actually\ncontract an STI or experience damage to their social reputations,\nfor example, experience greater regret from casual sex? Addi-\ntional candidate predictors include sexual disgust, moral disgust,\nand pathogen disgust (Tybur, Lieberman, & Griskevicius, 2009).\nThe greater disgust sensitivity among women in the sexual\ndomain, for example, may be linked to sex differences in sexual\nregret. Individual differences in disgust sensitivity might also\nexplain some proportion of within-sex variance in sexual regret.\nBecause women are more likely to have experienced sexual\ncoercion and pressure to have casual sex (Meston & Buss,\n2007), those experiences may influence regret about having had\ncasual sex--another hypothesis that awaits future research.\nConclusions\nOur first goal centered on whether sex differences in sexual\nregret would be found in a culture that stands out as among the\nmost sexually liberal, secularized, and gender egalitarian cul-\ntures in the world. The findings suggest that women report\nregretting their last casual sex experience moderately more than\nmen do and men report regretting markedly more having passed\nup their last chance to have casual sex. These sex differences\nshow no evidence of diminution in this sexually liberal, secular-\nized, and highly gender egalitarian culture compared to those\nfound in the original study, mirroring findings of sex differences\nin other mating domains, such as sexual jealousy, sexual mis-\nperception, and age preferences for mates, in Norwegian\nOur second goal focused on proximate predictors that might\naccount for sex differences in sexual regret--notably, worries\nabout pregnancy, STIs, and reputation as well as physical grat-\nification experienced during the sexual encounter. We found\nrobust sex differences on all these variables. Women, on aver-\nage, worried more about negative consequences and experienced\nless physical gratification from casual sexual encounters. None-\ntheless, our analyses suggest that the sex difference in sexual\nregret is not accounted for these potential proximate predictors.\nWe had greater success in predicting within-sex differences in\nsexual regret for men and women. Low sexual gratification was\nassociated with more sexual regret within both sexes, and indi-\nviduals with a more restricted sociosexual orientation reported\nmore sexual regret. Worry about sexual reputation was positively\nassociated with sexual regret for women only. In short, we have\nestablished the first empirical evidence for key psychological\npredictors of sexual regret within women and men.\nTaken together, the findings from the current study add to a\ndeeper understanding of the robustness of sex differences\nacross cultures and a deeper understanding of why individuals\nwithin each sex experience more or less sexual regret in the\ndomain of casual sex encounters.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBendixen, M.
