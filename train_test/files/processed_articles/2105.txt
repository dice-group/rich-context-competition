This\nstudy investigated differences in the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors between IDUs and non-IDUs in St.\nPetersburg, Russia and assessed associations between substance use patterns and sexual risks within and between\nthose two groups.\nMethods: Cross-sectional survey data and biological test results from 331 IDUs and 65 non-IDUs who have IDU sex\npartners were analyzed. Multivariate regression was employed to calculate measures of associations.\nResults: IDUs were less likely than non-IDUs to report multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex with casual\npartners. The quantity, frequency and intensity of alcohol use did not differ between IDUs and non-IDUs, but non-\nIDUs were more likely to engage in alcohol use categorized as risky per the alcohol use disorders identification test\n(AUDIT-C). Risky sexual practices were independently associated with monthly methamphetamine injection among\nIDUs and with risky alcohol use among non-IDUs. Having sex when high on alcohol or drugs was associated with\nunprotected sex only among IDUs.\nConclusions: Greater prevalence of sexual risk among non-IDUs who have IDU sex partners compared to IDUs\nsuggests the potential for sexual transmission of HIV from the high-prevalence IDU population into the general\npopulation. HIV prevention programs among IDUs in St. Petersburg owe special attention to risky alcohol use\namong non-IDUs who have IDU sex partners and the propensity of IDUs to have sex when high on alcohol or\ndrugs and forgo condoms.\nBackground\nTo date the great majority of Russian HIV infections\nand AIDS cases have been diagnosed among injection\ndrug users (IDUs) {Population Reference Bureau, 2007\nvious research indicates that drug injection is markedly\nmore prevalent than a decade ago [4]. In Russia and\nelsewhere in the former Soviet states, the drugs most\ncommonly injected are heroin and ephedrine derivates,\nincluding methamphetamine [5-7]. Both categories of\ndrugs have been independently associated with sexual\npractices that risk HIV transmission or acquisition\n[6,8,9]. In addition, alcohol consumption in Russia has\nsubstantially increased in the turbulent years following\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union [10,11] and is report-\nedly among the highest in the world [12]. Heavy alcohol\nconsumption, which is prevalent among IDUs in Russia,\nhas been associated with sexual risk-taking and injection\npractices that facilitate HIV transmission [13,14].\n* Correspondence: nadia.abdala@yale.edu\n1Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of\nMedicine, New Haven, CT, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2010 Abdala et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

There are\nseveral factors that determine whether HIV transmission\nwill be limited to the core population of injectors in\nwhich it is prevalent or if it will become a generalized\nepidemic [15]. Among these are the size and activity\nlevels of the bridging population, which is comprised of\nthose who form partnerships with both IDUs and with\nnon-IDUs, and partnership formation patterns within\nthe general population [16,17]. Studies conducted\namong Russian non-drug using youth indicate that in\nrecent years levels of unprotected sex have increased,\nage of sexual debut has decreased, rates of partner\nchange have increased, and sexual activity under the\ninfluence of alcohol has become more prevalent among\nthe general population, increasing the potential for the\ntransmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\noverall [18-20]. While HIV transmission-related beha-\nvior is prevalent among Russian IDUs [21-23], it is not\nknown whether such behavior is more or less prevalent\namong their non-IDU partners. In addition, while a\nnumber of substance-use-related patterns have been\nassociated with sexual risk among Russian IDUs, asso-\nciation between sexual risk and substance use has not\nbeen estimated for non-IDUs who have IDU sex\npartners.\nThe current analysis was conducted using data from a\nstudy in St. Petersburg that was part of a large multi-\nsite project, the Sexual Acquisition and Transmission of\nHIV Cooperative Agreement Program (SATH-CAP)\n[24]. The goal of SATH-CAP was to collect and analyze\ndata on sexual and drug use practices and other social,\nenvironmental and biological factors that may influence\nHIV transmission, from high-prevalence core popula-\ntions, i.e. IDUs and men who have sex with men (MSM)\nto the greater general populations of which they are\npart. This analysis compared the sexual risk behaviors\nand patterns of substance use between heterosexual\nIDUs and non-IDUs who have IDU sexual partners with\nthe following aims: (1) to investigate whether substance\nuse measures in both groups differed in their correla-\ntions with sexual risks, and (2) to determine whether\nsexual risk behaviors are associated with global sub-\nstance use levels and with substance use in sexual\ncontexts.\nMethods\nStudy Population and Recruitment into the SATH-CAP\nstudy\nThe SATH-CAP study protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Boards of Yale University, the Bio-\nmedical Center in St. Petersburg, and RAND Corpora-\ntion. Participants were recruited between November\nrespondent driven sampling (RDS) [24,25]. RDS is a\nchain-referral sampling methodology that uses struc-\ntured incentives and coupon disbursement procedures\nfor peer referrals. Conventional RDS methods were\nmodified [24] in this study to recruit both core members\n(IDUs and MSM) and their sex partners whether they\nwere core members or not. Briefly, enrolled core mem-\nbers were given coupons to distribute to their core\npeers and to their sex partners. Potential participants\nafter they received coupons had to call to schedule an\nappointment and to show up at the study site for elig-\nibility screening and enrollment. Newly enrolled cores\nwere in turn offered coupons to recruit additional core\npeers and their own sexual partners. Participation was\nconfidential. No locator information was collected but a\nnumber of bio-measures including forearm length and\nwrist circumference were collected to prevent repeat\nparticipation (duplicates).\nParticipants completed structured interviews and were\ngiven pre-test counseling before biological specimens\nwere collected for the testing of sexually transmitted\ninfections, including HIV. Participants received incen-\ntives including mobile phone cards and personal care\nitems; all received subway tokens, condoms and HIV\nprevention information. Participants were instructed\nwhen to return to the site to receive their laboratory\ntest results and post-test counseling. Participants were\nreferred for other medical services as needed.\nInterview Data Collection\nInterviews lasting 90-120 minutes were conducted using\ncomputer-assisted survey interviewing technology on\nlaptop computers. Information was collected on socio-\ndemographics, health status and HIV-associated sexual\nand injection risk behaviors. Socio-demographic items\nincluded age, sex, marital status, education, employment\nand source of income, housing and whether the partici-\npant considers him or herself homeless or had ever\nbeen jailed. Self-reported health data included HIV test-\ning and results, illicit injection drug use (IDU) in the\nlast 6 months, the number of times injected in the last\nmonth, whether the participant used methamphetamines\n-including amphetamines or ephedrine-in the past\nmonth, whether the participant used syringes or injec-\ntion equipment that had been used by others for injec-\ntion. Participants were asked three items from the\nAlcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C)\ninstrument: frequency of alcohol use in the last month,\nthe usual number of alcoholic drinks consumed at each\ndrinking event, and frequency in which participant got\ndrunk or consumed five or more drinks in two hours in\nthe last month. Sexual behaviors in the six months prior\nto interview included number of male and female sex\npartners, number of sex partnerships of less than three\nmonths duration, sex partnership type (i.e. main or non-\nmain), vaginal and anal sex with and without condoms\nat the last sexual encounter with up to five of their\nmost recent sexual partners, and for each reported part-\nnership, whether the participant or his or her partner\nhad been \"high\" on drugs or alcohol during one of their\nsexual encounters.\nSTI Detection Assays\nBlood and urine specimens were obtained from all parti-\ncipants. Serum was tested for human immunodeficiency\nvirus type-1 (HIV-1) and syphilis. HIV-1 testing involved\ntwo HIV-1 antibodies enzyme immunological assays\n(EIAs) (Vironostika HIV-1, Uni-Form-II plus-0; Biomer-\nieux, Netherlands and Genscreeen HIV-1/2; BioRad,\nFrance). Positive HIV-1 EIA tests were confirmed by\nWestern Blot (WB) (HIV-1 WB Type-1, Biorad, France).\nSerum samples were screened for syphilis with rapid\nplasma reagin test (RPR) (Macro-Vue RPR-Card Tests,\nBecton Dickinson, USA) and Treponema pallidum parti-\ncle agglutination assay (TPPA) (Serodia-TPPA, Fujirebio,\nJapan). Specimens were seropositive for syphilis if results\nof both tests were reactive. Urine specimens were tested\nfor nucleic acid from Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamy-\ndia) and Neisseriae gonorrheae (gonorrhea) using poly-\nmerase chain reaction (Amplicor CT/NG, Roche, USA).\nHypotheses Testing and Data Analysis\nThis study investigated the prevalence of sexual risk\nbehaviors, non-viral STIs and substance use patterns\nbetween IDUs and non-IDUs who have IDU sex part-\nners and tested three hypotheses: (1) that the prevalence\nof STIs and the frequency of sexual risk behaviors\nwould be greater among IDUs than non-IDUs, (2) that\nsubstance use measures that were correlated with sexual\nrisks would be different among IDUs and non-IDUs,\nand (3) that both global patterns of substance use and\nsubstance use in sexual contexts would be associated\nwith unprotected sex with casual partners among both\nIDUs as well as among non-IDUs.\nThe criteria for inclusion into this analysis were: injec-\ntion drug use in the last six months or having a sex\npartner who is an IDU; testing negative for HIV or\nbeing unaware of positive HIV status upon enrollment;\nif male, reporting only sex with females; being sexually\nactive in the last six months; and providing data on sex-\nual partnerships. Because sexual partnership information\nmay have been duplicated when participants recruited\ntheir own sexual partners into the study, sexual partner-\nships reported by recruits with his or her recruiter were\nexcluded from the analysis. Thus participants were\nexcluded from the analysis if their only reported sex\npartner was his or her recruiter.\nThree dimensions of HIV-related sexual risks served\nas separate outcomes: (1) reporting more than one sex\npartner in the prior six months, i.e. multiple sex part-\nners, (2) reporting unprotected sex with casual partners,\ni.e. with non-main or new (< 3 months) sex partners,\nand (3), testing positive for a non-viral STI (N. gonor-\nrheae, C. trachomatis and/or syphilis serology). We\nchose non-viral STIs as an outcome because these STIs\nrepresent recent sexual risk taking [26] and since they\nare not transmitted through sharing injection equipment\nthey are suitable markers for the comparison of sexual\nrisks between IDUs and non-IDUs.\nRisky alcohol use corresponded to AUDIT-C scores\ngreater than three for males and greater than two for\nfemales based on answers to the first three AUDIT\nquestions as determined in previous studies [27-29].\nUnsafe injection was defined as using syringes or equip-\nment that had been already used by another IDU. Hav-\ning sex when high on drugs or alcohol referred to\nparticipants who reported having sex while he/she or\nany partner was drunk or \"high\" on drugs.\nAll analyses were performed using Stata for Macintosh\nversion 10. Descriptive statistics were used to compare,\nbetween IDUs and non-IDUs, the prevalence of demo-\ngraphic, socio-economic measures, sexual behavior and\nnon-viral STIs, alcohol consumption patterns including\nAUDIT-C scores, and having sex when high on drugs or\nalcohol. Methamphetamine use was assessed for both\nIDUs and non-IDUs. For IDUs, descriptive statistics\nincluded injection frequency and unsafe injection. Dif-\nferences between IDUs and non-IDUs were assessed\nusing Chi-square tests, or for non-normally distributed\ncontinuous variables, Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\nBivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were\nconducted for all participants who fit inclusion criteria,\nand for IDUs and non-IDUs separately. Logistic regres-\nsion was employed to assess bivariate associations of the\nthree selected sexual risk behavior outcomes (multiple\nsex partners, unprotected sex, and a positive test for a\nnon-viral STI) with the demographic and substance use\nrelated factors. Multivariate logistic regression was con-\nducted to produce unconfounded estimates of associa-\ntions between each of the above outcomes and\ndemographic and substance-use patterns. Multivariate\nmodels were constructed by including all covariates that\nwere statistically significant at alpha level 0.2 in the\nbivariate analysis and gradually removing each non-sig-\nnificant covariate until all covariates were statistically\nsignificant (p < 0.05) or removal did not change adjusted\nodds ratio point estimates by > 10%. Because measures\nof injection frequency and unsafe injection were relevant\nfor IDUs but not for non-IDUs, associations between\nthose covariates and outcomes were assessed for IDUs\nbut not for non-IDUs. Similarly, injection drug in the\nprior six months was relevant only in models that\nincluded both IDUs and non-IDUs. Thus, multivariate\nmodels inclusive of all participants and those stratified\nby IDU status, had the potential to include overlapping,\nbut slightly different subsets of covariates.\nSince participants could report more than one sexual\npartner, we analyzed the risks factors related to condom\nuse at last intercourse within each sexual partnership\nusing generalized estimating equations (GEE).\nInteractions between drug injection in the prior 6\nmonths and three substance use related variables: at-risk\nAUDIT-C score, methamphetamine use, and having sex\nwhen high on drugs or alcohol were investigated. Inter-\naction terms between drug injection and each substance\nuse related variable were created separately, added one\nby one to the models, and compared with main effect\nmodels using likelihood-ratio tests. Risk factors were\nconsidered to be significantly different between IDUs\nand non-IDUs when an interaction term was significant\nafter being added to the main effects model and the\nlikelihood-ratio test confirmed its improvement of the\noverall fit of the model.\nResults\nGeneral Characteristics of Subjects\nIn all, 1,023 IDUs, MSM and their sexual partners were\nrecruited into the completed SATH-CAP study in St.\nPetersburg. After excluding HIV-infected participants\nwho were aware of being HIV positive (146), were MSM\n(242), reported zero sex partners (57), did not report\nnumber of sex partners in the prior six months (93), did\nnot answer questions about sexual partnerships (29) and\nhad as their only sex partner the participant who\nrecruited them into the study (60), 396 participants\nwere included in the analysis. These included 84% (331/\n396) who reported IDU in the prior six months and\nmale; age ranged from 18 to 53 years with a median of\nolder (Table 1), male, married, have uncompleted post-\nsecondary education, be unemployed, live with family,\nreport no legal income, and have been incarcerated.\nSexual Behavior and STI Outcomes\nIn bivariate analysis, non-IDUs were significantly more\nlikely than IDUs to report having had multiple sex part-\nners, casual partners, and unprotected sex at last inter-\ncourse with casual partners, i.e. with new (< 30 days) or\nnon-main partners. IDUs were more likely than non-\nIDUs to report having sex while the participant, his or\nher partner, or both were drunk or high (i.e. having sex\nwhen high on drugs or alcohol) (Table 1).\nThe prevalence of non-viral STIs was low and did not\nsignificantly differ between IDUs and non-IDUs. Among\nIDUs, the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea and\n(3/331), respectively. Two participants were co-infected\nwith chlamydia and gonorrhea. Among non-IDUs, the\nprevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis serology\nwere no co-infections. Non-viral STI prevalence did not\ndiffer by gender, but prevalence was too low for the ana-\nlysis to have any statistical power.\nSubstance Use\nAmong IDUs who reported the types of drugs used in\nthe last month, the drug most frequently used was her-\noin or opiates at 84% followed by methamphetamine at\n18%. Nearly all IDUs (99%) reported having taken opi-\nates and methamphetamine in the form of injection and\nthe use of other types of hard drugs was limited (< 7%).\nA quarter (82/331) reported using syringes or equip-\nment that had been used by someone else. The median\nmonthly injection frequency was 20 (Table 1). Eleven\npercent of non-IDUs reported consuming non-injectable\nmethamphetamine.\nNon-IDUs were significantly more likely than IDUs to\nreceive at-risk AUDIT-C scores. However, the median\nnumber of days they consumed alcohol per month, the\nmedian number of drinks at each drinking event, and\nthe median number of days participants \"got drunk\" or\nhad > 4 drinks in two hours in the previous 30 days did\nnot significantly differ between IDUs and non-IDUs.\nCorrelates of Testing Positive for a Non-viral STI\nTesting positive for a non-viral STI was independently\nno variable was independently associated with non-viral\nSTI. Insufficient observations did not permit an analysis\namong non-injectors.\nCorrelates of Having Multiple Sexual Partners\nIn multivariate logistic regressions using all eligible partici-\npants reporting multiple partnerships was independently\nassociated with being non-IDU, methamphetamine use,\nand reporting sex when high on drugs or alcohol (Table\n2). In analysis restricted to IDUs, reporting multiple sex\npartners was independently associated with methampheta-\nmine use and reporting sex when high on drugs or alco-\nhol. Among non-IDUs, having multiple sex partners was\nindependently associated with having sex while high on\ndrugs or alcohol and marginally associated with risky alco-\nhol use. The latter was retained in the multivariate model\nfor non-IDUs due to its removal changing the aOR for sex\nwhile high by > 10%.\nThere was one significant interaction between drug\ninjection and having sex when high on drugs or alcohol\n(p = 0.015). Having sex when high on drugs or alcohol\nwas significantly associated with having multiple sex\npartners for both IDUs and non-IDUs. However, the\nmagnitude of the relationship between having sex\nwhen high on drugs or alcohol and having multiple sex\npartners was greater for non-IDUs compared to IDUs\n(aOR = 10.7 vs. 1.8, respectively). No other interactions\nwere identified.\nCorrelates for Having Unprotected Sex\nIn multivariate logistic regression using all eligible parti-\ncipants, unprotected sex in the last six months was\nindependently associated with being married, being a\nnon-IDU, methamphetamine use and having sex when\nhigh on drugs or alcohol (Table 3). In analysis limited\nto IDUs, unprotected sex was associated with being\nTable 1 Comparing prevalence of substance use and sexual risk practices between heterosexual IDUs (n = 331) and\nn (%)*1 n (%)*1 p-value\nDemographics\nSexual behavior of subjects in the past 6 months\nSexually transmitted infections\nAlcohol consumption in the past month\nIllicit drug consumption in the past month*6\nInjection practices in the last 6 months\n* Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n*1 among participants who replied the question.\n*2 i.e. had unprotected sex with non-main or new (< 90 days) sexual partners.\n*3 had sex while participant or partner or both were drunk or high.\n*4 Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseiae gonorrheae and/or syphilis serology.\n*5 determined by an at-risk AUDIT-C score.\n*6 IDUs injected mostly heroin and meth.

Among non-IDUs, unpro-\ntected sex was independently associated with risky\nalcohol use.\nThere was a statistically significant interaction\nbetween IDU and risky alcohol use (p = 0.009), in that\nnon-IDUs who engaged in risky drinking had 6.7 greater\nodds of having unprotected sex than those who did not\nengage in risky drinking whereas there was no such rela-\ntionship for IDUs. No other interactions were statisti-\ncally significant.\nCorrelates for Having Unprotected Sex within Sexual\nPartnerships Reported by Participants\nIn an analysis conducted at the partnership level, GEE\nIDUs and non-IDU participants. Having unprotected sex\nwas independently associated with being married, not\nhaving a casual partner, methamphetamine use and hav-\ning sex when high on drugs or alcohol (Table 4). When\nunprotected sex was independently associated with being\nmarried, not having a casual partner, methamphetamine\nTable 2 Associations between substance use practices and having multiple sex partners for IDUs and non-IDUs\n*1 99% of methamphetamine use was in the form of injection among IDUs.\n*2 determined by an at-risk AUDIT-C score.\n*3 had sex while participant or partner or both were drunk or high.\n*4 also controlled for education, employment, homelessness, incarceration, living with family and having legal income.

These variables were not significant.\nuse, unsafe injection and having sex when high on drugs\nor alcohol. In analysis of 140 sexual partnerships reported\nby 65 non-IDUs, unprotected sex was associated with\nolder age.\nDiscussion\nContrary to the initial hypothesis, IDUs were signifi-\ncantly less likely than non-IDUs who reported at least\none IDU sex partner to have multiple sex partners and\nunprotected sex with casual partners. IDUs had fewer\npartners even after controlling for methamphetamine\nuse, which was associated with higher number of sexual\npartners. This contrasts with findings from other studies\nthat suggested that IDUs engaged in as much or more\n[9,30] sexual risk behaviors compared to individuals\nwho did not inject.\nIDUs were less likely than non-IDUs to engage in\nrisky drinking, and risky drinking was not independently\nassociated with sexual risk among IDUs. These results\ncontrast with studies showing alcohol consumption to\nbe greater among narcotic [31] or methamphetamine\nusers [8,32] and to be associated with sexual risk taking\namong IDUs [33,34]. In a previous study, IDUs in Russia\nreported consuming lesser quantities of alcohol than\nIDUs in the United States [13]. Given that drug depen-\ndence and alcoholism have been observed to be co-\noccurring events in Russia [14] it is unclear whether the\nlesser prevalence of risky drinking among IDUs is due\nto a less risky alcohol consumption pattern or if it\nresults from our failure to identify some other type of\nhazardous drinking that may occur in Russia [12]. It\ncould be argued that the lower levels of risky alcohol\nuse among IDUs could be due to underreporting as a\nresult of social desirability bias or stigma and discrimi-\nnation against IDUs. However, alcohol use is widely\naccepted in Russia and studies have shown that drinking\nis often used as a facilitator of sex and as a symbol of\nmasculinity in the Russian culture [35]. In addition,\nthere was no significant difference in the reported fre-\nquency of alcohol use between IDUs and non-IDUs in\nthis study, it was only the pattern of risky drinking that\nsignificantly differed between the two groups. A possible\nexplanation for these results is that alcohol is often used\nto remove pressure, relax and reduce stress whereas opi-\nates are much more powerful relaxants than alcohol\n[35-39]. Since the majority of IDUs in this study injected\nheroin, they may have had a lesser need to resort to\nrisky patterns of drinking in order to self-medicate [31]\nTable 4 Associations between substance use practices and unprotected sex within all partnerships*1 reported by IDUs\nand non-IDUs\nInjection drug use last\nMeth use, injected or\nnot,\nInjected > 20 times/\nmonth\nUnsafe injection last\nHad sex when high on\ndrugs or alcohol*4\n*1 in GEE analysis limited to sexual partnerships reported by IDUs and non-IDUs.\n*2 99% of methamphetamine use was in the form of injection among IDUs.\n*3 determined by an at-risk AUDIT-C score.\n*4 had sex while participant or partner or both were drunk or high.\n*5 also controlled for education, employment, homelessness, incarceration, living with family and having legal income. These variables were not significant.\ncompared to non-IDUs. Another possible explanation\nfor the lower levels of risky drinking among IDUs,\ncomes from data showing that a majority 95% of IDUs\nin Russia are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [40]\nand HCV infections often lead to liver diseases [41].\nIDUs are also more likely to have HIV, to receive antire-\ntroviral therapy or to have co-morbid conditions leading\nto poor health outcomes [42]. All of these factors could\nlead to a reduction of tolerance among IDUs for heavy\npatterns of drinking. The sedating effects of heroin and\npoor health conditions among IDUs could also account\nfor the lower levels of sexual risk behaviors observed\namong IDUs compared to non-IDUs. In addition, the\ndiscrepancy between the two groups may be com-\npounded by the increase in sexual risks that result from\nthe greater risky alcohol use among non-IDUs [35].\nSimilar to previous findings, the present results show\nmethamphetamine use to be the strongest predictor of\nhaving multiple sex partners and unprotected sex\nwhile among non-IDUs, those sexual behaviors were\nassociated with risky alcohol use [20,45].\nThe greater likelihood of reporting sex while high on\ndrugs or alcohol among IDUs as well as among non-\nIDUs who had multiple sex partners probably reflects the\ngreater amounts of substance use among IDUs and non-\nIDUs who had multiple sex partners. Only IDUs were\nmore likely to forgo condom use when they had sex\nwhen high on drugs or alcohol. Similar to other studies\nof non-IDUs, the major risk factor associated with unpro-\ntected sex was the participant's general (i.e. monthly) pat-\ntern of risky drinking and not being drunk at the time of\nsex [46]. Thus, programs to increase condom use among\nIDUs need to address substance use patterns that occur\nin the context of sex, while among non-IDUs, general\ndrinking patterns must be addressed [33].\nNo significant difference was observed in the sexual\nrisk behaviors according to participants' gender, either\noverall or in the analysis stratified by drug use status\nsuggesting greater similarities rather than differences\nbetween the sexual risks of men and women in this\nstudy. Given that previous studies have shown substance\nabusing women to be at greater risk for unsafe sex and\nSTIs than substance abusing men [47-49] and studies in\nRussia have shown sex risk behaviors to be more likely\namong substance abusing men than among substance\nabusing women [35], it is also possible that subtle gen-\nder differences exist but were not identified in this\nstudy. Future research that takes into consideration\nmotivations for risk behaviors and self efficacy for risk\nreduction might be able to provide further insight into\nthese results.\nThe prevalence of STIs other than HIV has important\nepidemiologic implications given the propensity of STIs\nto increase the likelihood of HIV transmission [50,51].\nOverall, STI prevalence among non-IDUs was compar-\nable to the STI prevalence from the general population\nin St. Petersburg [52,53], and STI prevalence among\nIDUs in this study was similar to the prevalence found\namong IDUs in other countries [54,55]. The low STI\nprevalence might reflect a trend of reduced STIs being\nreported over the years in Russia [56-58]. The results\nhave implications for behavior intervention research.\nThe low STI prevalence may suggest that it may not be\nfeasible or cost effective to use STIs outcomes in pro-\njects to reduce risk behaviors among these groups. How-\never, given that the STI prevalence among participants\nis actually higher because other common STIs were not\ntested in this study, given the great prevalence of sexual\nrisk behaviors among non-IDUs, and given that partici-\npants are part of vulnerable populations, efforts to\ndetect and treat STIs among these groups need to\ncontinue.\nThis study had several limitations. Participants\nrecruited into this study were IDUs and non-IDUs who\nreported at least one IDU sexual partner; results may\nnot apply to non-IDUs who have never had sex with an\nIDU. Because the capacity of RDS to produce probability\nsamples is limited [59] the generalizability of these\nresults even within the sampled populations may also be\nlimited. Sex risk behaviors may relate to substance use\npatterns; therefore, behaviors might have been different\nif the proportions of heroin, methamphetamine and\nalcohol users had been different. This study may have\nrecruited individuals who were more comfortable parti-\ncipating in research projects rather than IDUs who were\nharder to reach. Conversely, certain or all risk behaviors\nmay have been underreported due to social desirability\nor other types of bias. Last, due to questionnaire design,\nwe could not investigate whether having sex when\n\"high\" was a specific effect of alcohol or of another\ndrug, nor could we assess whether it was the participant,\nhis or her partner or both who were drunk or high\nwhen sex occurred, nor could we assess the level at\nwhich participant was \"high\". Missing of data resulted in\nfewer observations in multivariate models which may\nincrease risk of type II error; further, if missing data did\nnot occur at random the potential for bias in ORs exists.\nConclusions\nGreater prevalence of sexual risk behaviors among non-\nIDUs who report partnerships with IDUs, compared to\nIDUs themselves, suggests a potential mechanism for\nspread of HIV beyond the IDU population. Interventions\nto reduce HIV transmission should address alcohol con-\nsumption among non-IDUs who report sexual partner-\nships with IDUs, and methamphetamine use and the\npropensity of having sex when high among IDUs.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the following NIDA grants to the SATH CAP\ntheir support: RTI International, the University of Illinois-Chicago, and the\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles.\nAuthor details\n1Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of\nMedicine, New Haven, CT, USA. 2The Biomedical Center, St. Petersburg,\nRussian Federation.\nAuthors' contributions\nNA main contributor to conception, statistic analysis and drafting of this\nmanuscript.\nEW contributed to conception, statistic analysis and writing of this\nmanuscript.\nOT contributed to data acquisition, coordination and management, as well\nas quality control and interpretation of data.\nTK contributed to data acquisition, quality control and interpretation and\nmanagement of data.\nSV carried out laboratory tests, interpretation and quality control of test\nresults and contributed to management and interpretation of data.\nAK contributed to conception and review of the manuscript.\nRH contributed to conception, writing and review of the manuscript.\nAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nReferences\n2.
