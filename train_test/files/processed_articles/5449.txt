Blood samples were also obtained from age-matched healthy controls. Cytokine levels\nwere investigated using flow cytometry-assisted immunoassay.\nResults: Forty-five patients with severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (aged 10 \u00c6 5\nmonths) and 35 healthy age-matched controls were included.

Age-group differences in serum cytokine levels did not correspond to\nage-group differences in endotracheal-fluid cytokine levels. Serum IL-6 levels were significantly\nhigher in patients who subsequently died versus those who survived (267.12 pg/ml versus 20.75 pg/\nml, respectively).\nConclusion: High IL-6 concentrations were associated with mortality in patients <5 years of age\nwith severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.\n",

When microorgan-\nisms do enter the bronchioles and alveoli,\ninflammation occurs, and many cells are\nactivated to release cytokines and mediators\nto launch and maintain the inflammatory\nresponse.2 A balance between inflammatory\nresponse and anti-inflammatory processes is\nnecessary to maintain lung homeostasis.\nMacrophage cells transit into the lungs\nfrom the pulmonary capillaries and reside in\nthe respiratory tract, alveoli and interstitial\nspace around the alveoli. Macrophages play\na role in regulating the acute and chronic\ninflammatory response, and although they\ncan proliferate in the lungs, their numbers\nare often not high enough to fight infec-\ntion.3,4 Macrophages have phagocytic\nability and are a source of cytokines,\nchemokines, and other inflammatory medi-\nators.5,6 Other cell types including neutro-\nphils, lymphocytes, epithelial cells and mast\ncells also participate in inflammation, pro-\nducing cytokines and helping to modulate\nthe inflammatory response.2\nAn imbalance in the two types of\ncytokines, proinflammatory and anti-\ninflammatory, may influence the prognosis\nof sepsis and other infectious and inflam-\nmatory diseases.7,8 The proinflammatory\ncytokines include tumour necrosis factor\n(TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8,\nand interferon (IFN)-g, all of which\nactivate the immune system and participate\nin the acute inflammatory response.\nThe anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as\nIL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-a\nand IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) play a\nmajor role in regulating the activities of cells\nand other cytokines.9 Alveolar macrophages\nsecrete anti-inflammatory cytokines to\nreduce inflammation in the lungs,10,11 for\nexample, TGF-a receptor is present on most\ncells and TGF is known to promote wound\nhealing and fibrosis.10 Proinflammatory\ncytokines encourage transition of T helper\n(Th) type 0 cells towards Th1, which can\nfurther amplify the inflammatory cascade by\nsecretion of INF-g, TNF-a, IL-1, IL-12, and\ngranulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulat-\ninhibits the production of proinflammatory\ncytokines by T cells, natural killer cells, and\nmonocytes, thus reducing inflammation.12\nDysregulation of cytokines and the cells that\nprocure them may predispose to severe\nMacrophages alone may not be able to\ncontain and destroy bacteria during infec-\ntion, and require the influx of polymorpho-\nnuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to assist in\ncontainment.15 Cytokines, such as TNF-a,\nIL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8, are secreted by alveo-\nlar macrophages and act as chemotactic\nagents for PMNs, enhancing the phagocytic\nactivity occurring in the lungs. Over pro-\nduction of these cytokines, however, can\nbe destructive, damaging normal lung\nstructure, and increase morbidity and\nSeveral life-threatening bacterial lung\ndiseases are demonstrated to be caused by\nexcessive neutrophil-mediated inflammatory\nsignals, including TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6; IL-8\nhospitalized patients with pneumonia, blood\nlevels of cytokines such as IL-1RA, IL-6,\nIL-8, IL-10 were shown to increase in the\nacute phase, and rapidly decrease when\npatients were discharged from hospital.17\nIn bacterial pneumonia the cytokine\nresponse is mostly confined to the affected\nlung,18\u00ad21 but systemic concentrations of\nconcentrations of cytokines in blood are\nreflected by, and have been shown to pre-\nPrior studies of infectious diseases have\nmainly focused on the systemic inflamma-\ntory response, investigating markers such as\nthe number of white blood cells, the number\nof neutrophils, and C-reactive protein\n(CRP) levels, that also demonstrate the\nseverity of inflammation.25 Studying cyto-\nkine transition in patients with severe pneu-\nmonia may help in determining prognostic\nfactors of disease severity and outcomes,\nand may help to determine interventions. In\nVietnam, minimal data are available on\nperipheral blood and endotracheal fluid\ncytokine levels in children with pneumonia\nwho are intubated. Thus, the objective of the\npresent research was to study clinical char-\nacteristics and cytokine levels in young\npatients with severe pneumonia requiring\nmechanical ventilation compared with\nhealthy age-matched controls, in order to\ndetermine if cytokine levels were associated\nwith outcome in paediatric cases of severe\npneumonia.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional\nstudy sequentially enrolled patients <5 years\nof age, who were admitted to the Intensive\nCare Unit, National Hospital of Paediatrics,\nHanoi, Vietnam diagnosed with severe\npneumonia and respiratory failure requiring\nmechanical respiratory support, and healthy\nage-matched controls who received routine\ncare also at the National Hospital of\nAugust 2014. Inclusion criteria comprised:\nsevere pneumonia requiring mechanical\nrespiratory support; endotracheal\nintubation within 24 h following hospital\nadmission; aged between 1 month and\n5 years; and legal proxy consent to partici-\npate in the study. Exclusion criteria com-\nprised: severe pneumonia with other chronic\ndiseases, such as congenital heart disease,\nencephalitis, stroke, and chronic lung dis-\neases; or endotracheal intubation conducted\n>24 h following hospital admission.\nPneumonia was diagnosed according to\nclinical symptoms, signs and laboratory\ntests:26 Fever or low temperature, a dry\ncough or cough with phlegm, fast breathing,\nchest indrawing, crackles upon auscultation\nof both lungs, and chest X-ray with typical\nfindings consistent with pneumonia.\nSevere pneumonia was diagnosed based\non signs and symptoms of pneumonia, chest\nindrawing, respiratory failure without cyan-\nosis, SpO2\nnormal or slightly decreased PaCO2\nSeriously severe pneumonia was diag-\nnosed based on signs and symptoms of\npneumonia, respiratory failure with cyan-\nosis of varying degrees, respiratory rate\n(slow or fast breathing, episodes of apnea,\nand with chest indrawing), SpO2\nThis study was approved by the Medical\nEthics Committee of the National Hospital\nof Paediatrics, Hanoi, Vietnam (No. 954B/\nBV.NTW- VNCSKTE), and written informed\nconsent was obtained from the legal proxies of\nall study participants.\nData and sample collection\nRelevant data for the present study were\ngathered from the patient's hospital data-\nbase records, and a complete history and\nexam was obtained for all participants.\nVenous blood samples (2 ml) were drawn\ninto tubes without anticoagulant from\npatients meeting the inclusion criteria\nwithin the first 24 h following endotracheal\nintubation, and from control participants.\nImmediately following collection and trans-\nfer to the processing laboratory, blood\nsamples were placed at 37C for 30 min to\nallow clotting. Samples were then centri-\nsubsequent fibrin plug was removed with\nglass chopsticks followed by further sample\nEndotracheal fluid samples (2 ml) were col-\nlected by aspiration via catheter following\ninjection of 5 ml sterile 0.9% NaCl into the\nendotracheal tube from patients meeting the\ninclusion criteria within the first 24 h follow-\ning intubation. Serum and endotracheal\nfluid samples were stored at \u00ad80C prior to\nanalysis.\nQuantification of peripheral blood and\nendotracheal fluid cytokine levels\nSerum and endotracheal fluid cytokine\nquantification was performed at the\nImmunology Laboratory of Military\nMedical Academy 103, Hanoi, Vietnam,\nvia flow cytometry-assisted immunoassay\nusing the Bio-Plex\u00d5 system of reagents\nand equipment (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,\nUSA), according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\nFirst, 96-well assay plates were pre-\nwetted by adding 100 ml of assay buffer\n(Bio-Plex ProTM; Bio-Rad) and removing\nthe liquid using vacuum filtration. Magnetic\nbead sets coloured with two fluorescent dyes\n(red and infrared) at distinct ratios, and\nconjugated to capture monoclonal antibo-\ndies specific to target cytokine epitopes\n(Bio-Plex\u00d5, Bio-Rad), were diluted to a\n1 \u00c2 working suspension, vortexed for 30 s\nat medium speed, then 50 ml was transferred\nto each well of the assay plate. The plate was\nwashed twice with 100 ml of wash buffer\nusing a Bio-Plex ProTM Wash Station with\nthe MAG \u00c2 2 programme setting (Bio-Rad).\nDiluted standards, blanks, samples, and\ncontrols were gently vortexed for 5 s, and\n50 ml was transferred to each well of the\nassay plate, which was then covered with\nsealing tape, protected from light with alu-\nminium foil and incubated on shaker at\nroom temperature. Following incubation,\nthe sealing tape was slowly removed and\ndiscarded, and the plate washed three times\nwith 100 ml of wash buffer as before.\nSecondary biotinylated monoclonal detec-\ntion antibodies, specific to a different epi-\ntope on the target cytokines (1 \u00c2 dilution;\nBio-Plex\u00d5 human cytokines; Bio-Rad), were\ngently vortexed for 5 s, poured into a reagent\nreservoir, and 25 ml was then transferred to\neach well. Plates were covered with new\nsealing tape, protected from light with alu-\nminium foil, and incubated on a shaker for\n30 min at room temperature before washing\nthree times with 100 ml of wash buffer.\nFinally, 50 ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin\n(SA-PE) reporter conjugate (diluted 1 \u00c2)\nwas vortexed and transferred to each well,\nand the covered plate incubated at room\ntemperature to form streptavidin-biotin\ncomplexes. Following the streptavidin-\nphycoerythrin incubation step, the plate\nwas washed three times with 100 ml of wash\nbuffer, then 125 ml of assay buffer (Bio-Plex\nProTM; Bio-Rad) was added to each well,\nand the covered plate incubated on a shaker\nfor 30 s at room temperature. The plate was\nready to read following removal of the\nsealing tape. The identity and quantity of\nthe cytokines was assessed using a flow\ncytometry/laser excitation\u00adbased Bio-Plex\n200 system (Bio-Rad) with two different\nto generate and record two types of inde-\npendent fluorescent signal emitted by the\nbeads (qualitative signals) and from the\nspecific reaction emitted by the particle\nsurface (quantitative signals).\nBased on the density of the fluorescence\nemitted from the particles incubated with\nknown concentrations of cytokines, the\ntarget cytokines were quantified.

The immune\nresponse in patients with pneumonia\nvaries, depending on cause and severity of\nthe disease, but the most important physio-\nlogical reaction is the release of various\ncytokines by inflammatory cells, to magnify\nthe inflammatory reaction in the lungs.8 The\ninflammatory response depends on the types\nand concentrations of cytokines produced,\nand research into the inflammatory response\nin pneumonia has shown an imbalance\nbetween proinflammatory and anti-inflam-\nmatory factors, which is often related to\nmortality in children.17 Cytokines, such as\nGM-CSF and IL-8, are known to cause an\nincrease in the inflammatory response and\ninflux of neutrophils into the airways.\nDuring the same time, there is a transition\nboth of which further enhance inflammation\nand the influx of other infammatory cells.\nThe cytokines produced by Th1 cells include\nTNF-a, INF-g, and IL-6. Th-2 cytokines are\nkey players in the development of allergic\ndisease, while Th17 cells cause a neutrophil\nresponse, and are associated with IL-17,\nin the present study showed increased IL-6,\nIL-8 and GM-CSF levels, as expected for an\nacute bacterial pneumonia. Levels of IL-10,\nwhich downregulate inflammation,34 were\nnot significantly elevated in the present\npatients, and reflected the lack of down-\nregulation of the immune response. In\naddition, IL-12, TNF-a, and INF-g are\nmore commonly elevated in response to\nTable 4.

TNF-a and IL-6\nnormally act as proinflammatory cytokines,\nwith the early response cytokine, TNF-a,\nappearing early in patients with pneumo-\nnia.36 During acute respiratory distress syn-\ndrome (ARDS), proinflammatory cytokines\nincrease quickly,37 for example, in bronch-\noalveolar lavage samples from patients with\nearly stage ARDS, the concentration of\nTNF-a is increased.20 The present study\nfailed to demonstrate an increase in TNF-a\nand IFN-g, possibly because the latter is\nmore important in viral and intracellular\norganism infections,38 and the present\npatient population differed from those\nexpected to have viral infections. Most\nimportantly, the present findings suggest\nan association between significantly elevated\nserum IL-6 levels and mortality. Other pub-\nlished studies have shown that the severity of\npneumonia is reflected by levels and types of\ncytokines in the blood.18\nadmitted to the emergency department for\npneumonia,19 in which blood concentrations\nof TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10 were measured\ndaily during the first week of pneumonia,\nconcentrations of all cytokines were shown\nto be increased in 82% of patients. Cytokine\nconcentrations were highest at hospital\nadmission and decreased quickly following\nthe first day, but remained high in the first\nweek. High concentrations of IL-6 and\nIL-10 reflected serious disease and a higher\nrisk of mortality.19 In patients with pneu-\nmonia in the early days and the 30th day of\nthe disease,17 IL-6 concentrations were\naddition, the concentration of IL-12\nincreased by 6%, and IFN-g by 6%, in the\nacute phase,17 which was similar to the\npresent data in patients with severe pneu-\nmonia versus healthy age-matched controls.\nThe present results showed that, compared\nwith healthy controls, IL-6 concentration\n2.06 pg/ml), IL-8 concentration increased\nGM-CSF concentration increased 10 fold\nIn a study of bronchoalveolar lavage\nfrom 74 patients with pneumonia on mech-\nanical ventilation and 17 control patients\nwithout pneumonia on ventilators,20 con-\ncentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were signifi-\ncantly increased compared with controls,\nwhile TNF-a was not elevated. In a further\nstudy of 31 patients with pneumonia aged 13\nyears, and 6 healthy age-matched controls,23\nbronchoalveolar lavage IL-8 concentration\nwas significantly increased in patients with\npneumonia versus controls, and there was\nno correlation between bronchoalveolar\nlavage IL-8 concentration and polymorpho-\nnuclear leukocyte quantities. IL-8 is a cyto-\nkine produced by macrophages and\nepithelial cells, amongst other cell types,\nand airway smooth muscle cells and endo-\nthelial cells are the first to secrete IL-8 to\nattract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the\ninflammatory area.39 Similar to other stu-\ndies, in which blood IL-8 concentration was\nshown to be increased in children with\npneumonia,40 and the concentration of\nIL-6 and IL-8 was shown to be increased\nin the first 48 hours of pneumonia,18 the\npresent results showed that IL-8 concentra-\ntion was highly increased in the blood serum\nof very young children with pneumonia\nunder 5 years of age, compared with healthy\nage-matched children. These results demon-\nstrate that even in early life, increases in pro-\ninflammatory cytokines are detected in\nresponse to infection.\nIn the present study, serum TNF-a levels\nwere not increased within 24 h of intubation,\nbut levels in bronchoalveolar lavage were\nhigh compared with serum. These data\nsuggest that the inflammatory response\noccurs in the airways early, before the\nsystemic reaction. TNF-a concentration\nwas shown to be increased in the alveolar\nand lung parenchyma of mice following\nstimulation with different respiratory aller-\ngens.21 Inhibition of TNF-a reduces neutro-\nphil concentration in the lungs, and the\nprocess of destroying bacteria, resulting in\nrapid increase in the severity of disease, and\nmortality rate was shown to increase from\nwith complete inhibition of TNF-a follow-\ning injection of 102 units of Klebsiella\nA published study in children with pneu-\nmonia15 showed that blood IL-6 concentra-\ntion in children with pneumonia on\nmechanical ventilation who survived was\nchildren with pneumonia who did not sur-\nvive. In this study,15 IL-6 and TNF-a con-\ncentration in endotracheal fluids was high,\ncorresponding to the scale of lung injury,\nand blood IL-6 concentration was con-\nsidered to be a prognostic factor for mor-\ntality in children. Similarly, the present\nstudy found that serum IL-6 concentrations\nwere high in patients with pneumonia who\ndid not survive versus patients who survived\nively), suggesting an association between\nhigh blood IL-6 concentration and mortal-\nity. Analyses of serum cytokine concentra-\ntions between three age groups in the\npresent study revealed statistically signifi-\ncant differences in IL-10 levels only.\nEndotracheal fluid concentrations of IL-6,\nIL-8 and TNF-a, however, were signifi-\ncantly higher in patients aged 6\u00ad12 months\nthan in patients aged under 6 months or over\n12 months, and IFN-g was significantly\nhigher in patients aged 6\u00ad12 months and\n>12 months versus those aged <6 months.\nIn conclusion, cytokines such as IL-6,\nIL-8, IL-10, and GM-CSF appear to play an\nimportant role in acute inflammation in\nyoung patients, under 5 years of age, with\nsevere pneumonia. The inflammatory\nresponse was shown to occur at the infection\nsite (in the lungs) and systemically (in blood\nserum). High IL-6 concentration was asso-\nciated with mortality.\n"
