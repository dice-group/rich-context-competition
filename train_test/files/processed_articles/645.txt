Unlike the last\nround of changes, during which raising the early\nretirement age was never seriously considered, pro-\nposals to raise the early retirement age from age 62 to\nage 65 are now being evaluated as one component\nwithin alternative packages designed to put the So-\ncial Security System into long-term balance (see, for\nThere are strong arguments for raising the age of\nearliest eligibility for Social Security retirement bene-\nfits. The life expectancy of the average American has\nimproved substantially since the inception of Social\nSecurity, as has health at any given age (see Appen-\ndix, Note 3). Hence, it is argued that Americans could\nwork longer to pay for their longer and healthier\nretirement years. Prior to 1961 (the year men first\nbecame eligible to receive Social Security benefits at\nage 62), the labor force participation rates of men\naround age 62 were similar. As can be seen in Table 1,\nthe labor force participation rate of men age 61 was\nwith the greatest drop for men age 63 coming in the\nparticipation rates of men these ages have been\napproximately constant. While many factors besides\nchanges in the Social Security retirement age are\nresponsible for the dramatic drop in the labor force\nparticipation rate of men aged 62 to 70 over the past\nthree decades, these major decreases are more con-\nsistent with economic factors such as increased\nwealth, richer employers, and Social Security pen-\nsion plans than with worsening health. (See Quinn,\nTable 1. United States Male Labor Force Participation\nYear\nAge\nare based on decennial U.S. Census data. Thereafter, they are\nfrom unpublished Department of Labor statistics, based on annual\nConsumer Population Survey labor force participation questions.\nBurkhauser, & Myers, 1990, for a review of the litera-\nture on the influence of health and economic varia-\nbles on retirement.)\nBased on these premises, it is argued that raising\nthe earliest age of eligibility for Social Security retire-\nment benefits might be the least burdensome way of\nclosing the projected Social Security deficit. But it is\nalways good advice to \"beware of the mean\" in\nevaluating the economic well-being of older Ameri-\ncans (see Appendix, Note 4). Hence, it could be\nargued that while average health, economic wealth,\nand employer pension eligibility are rising, a signifi-\ncant number of people who first take Social Security\nbenefits while they are age 62 are in poor health,\nhave little economic wealth, no employer pension,\nand have not recently worked. Furthermore, it could\nbe argued that it is this vulnerable group of older\npersons who would be most adversely affected by\nincreasing the earliest age of eligibility for Social\nSecurity benefits.\nThis article uses Wave 1 and the early release\nversion of Wave 2 of the Health and Retirement\nSurvey (HRS) to focus on men and women aged 62 in\nnature of the income and net asset data to measure\nthe economic well-being of individuals in the years\njust before and just after they are first able to take\nearly Social Security benefits. We compare those\nwho take Social Security retirement or spousal bene-\nfits while they are age 62 with those who do not and\nfind that the economic well-being of these two\ngroups in the years just before they reach early retire-\nment eligibility age is much closer than is implied by\nsimply looking at their income after they become\neligible at age 62. But we also find that there is great\ndiversity within the two populations. When we look\nacross health, employer pension status, and Social\nSecurity acceptance status, we find health is a better\ngauge of economic well-being than is taking early\nSocial Security benefits. Furthermore, we find that\nthe great majority of men who take Social Security\nretirement benefits while they are age 62 enjoy good\nhealth. In addition, 2 of every 3 men who take early\nbenefits live in households which already are receiv-\ning employer pension benefits. Less than 10% of the\nmen who take Social Security benefits while they are\nage 62 are both in poor health and dependent on\nSocial Security as their only source of pension in-\ncome. Our results are similar for female early Social\nSecurity recipients.\nMulti-Period Characteristics of Early Social Security\nTakers and Postponers\nThe Health and Retirement Survey began in 1992\nwith a random sample of respondents aged 51 to 61\nand their families. A reinterview of these respon-\ndents was fielded in 1994, and a new wave of inter-\nviews will occur every two years for the next decade.\nWhile there were 11,539 respondents and spouses in\nthe first wave, we will only be able to make use of a\nportion of the sample, since we want to capture\ntransitions onto the Social Security retirement rolls\nwhile a person is age 62. This requires us to focus\nof the first wave of interviews, since they constitute\nthe population of people who gained eligibility by\nthe time the second wave of the HRS was collected in\nrespondents reach age 62, the number of individuals\nin the HRS who face the decision of whether or not to\ntake Social Security benefits while they are age 62 will\ngrow. We are currently able to capture 1,235 men and\nAppendix, Note 6). A brief description of our sample\nand how each variable was constructed can be found\nin Table 2. We exclude from our sample anyone who\nreceived Social Security benefits prior to age 62 (see\nAppendix, Note 7).\nIn Table 3 we look at the employment, health, and\neconomic well-being of this population of men and\nwomen in two years: in 1992, when they were on the\nverge of age eligibility for early Social Security bene-\nemployed.

If the\n(1994), the respondent's status is set to \"taker.\" Respondents who accept benefits in a year\nprior to the year they are 62 are dropped from our sample. Respondents are otherwise\nclassified as \"postponers.\"\nSurprisingly, the differences in employment be-\ntween male Social Security takers and postponers in\n1994 does not appear to be driven by differences in\nthe prevalence of health limitations in the two popu-\nlations. Using our measure of poor health -- whether\na person has a limit on the type or amount of work\nperformed -- we show that the men in our sample\nwho took Social Security retirement benefits at age\nwho postponed Social Security benefits past age 62\n(see Appendix, Note 9). When their health was again\nmeasured in 1994, although the prevalence of health\nlimitations increased during the period for both\ngroups of men, these proportions remain roughly\nequivalent between the two groups (20% vs 21%).\nWhile this should not be taken as evidence that\nhealth is unimportant in the decision to take early\nSocial Security benefits, it does call into question\npopular conceptions of early Social Security benefi-\nciaries as having a markedly higher prevalence of\nhealth problems relative to those who delay accept-\nAlthough, on average, men who take Social Secu-\nrity benefits when they are age 62 are similar to men\nwho do not, they differ in some important dimen-\nsions. For example, the median early Social Security\ntaker had a somewhat lower household income in\nSocial Security postponer. By the second wave of the\nHRS, this difference in median household income is\n(the difference between columns 2 and 3 in Table 3).\nHowever, median income is not the best measure\nof economic well-being at ages near retirement. This\nis because those who could have worked but chose\nto retire are willing to trade labor income for more\nleisure time. Hence, simple comparisons of income\nat or around age 62 are likely to overstate the gap in\neconomic well-being between those who take early\nSocial Security benefits and those who do not. A\nbetter measure is net assets. When we use this mea-\nsure, early Social Security takers actually have\nslightly greater median net assets than postponers in\nassets of takers remains greater than that of post-\nponers, although the median increase in net assets\nfor takers ($1,500) is smaller than for postponers\n($5,400). This is not surprising given the greater labor\nforce participation of postponers in 1994.\nTable 3.

Among postponers, 57% were eligible\nto receive an employer pension in 1992. Hence, it\nappears that takers are at least as likely as postponers\nto have pension wealth (see Appendix, Note 11).\nNot surprisingly, most men who take early Social\nSecurity benefits have also begun taking their em-\nployer pension benefits, if they are eligible to do so.\nan employer pension. In contrast, many men who do\nnot take early Social Security benefits at age 62 also\ndid not take their employer pension even though\nthey were eligible to do so -- only 25% of postponers\nreported pension income in 1994 (see Appendix,\nWhile the median early Social Security taker may\nbe approximately as well off as the median post-\nponer, greater poverty rates for early takers are still\npossible. We find that while the poverty rates of\ntakers and postponers are approximately the same in\nand the poverty rate of takers is higher --12% vs 9%\n-- than postponers.\nIn the years prior to acceptance, men who take\nearly Social Security retirement benefits are very simi-\nlar to men who do not in terms of health, income, and\nnet assets, even though they are more likely to be\nreceiving an employer pension (35% vs 16%) and to\nbe out of work (44% vs 22%). This preliminary evi-\ndence suggests that on average the pull of benefits\nmay be at least as important for men as the push of\npoor health in their decision to take Social Security\nretirement benefits while they are age 62.\nIn the last three columns of Table 3 we look at the\nexperience of women in the sample. We disaggregate\nthe sample by gender because men and women in\nthis age cohort are likely to have very different earn-\ning histories. The great majority of these men and\nwomen are married, and men of this generation are\nmuch more likely to have been the primary market\nearner in a married household. Hence, the transition\nof men onto the Social Security retirement rolls is\nlikely to have a greater impact on household eco-\nnomic well-being than the transition of women onto\nthe rolls. As can be seen in columns 5 and 6, this is the\ncase. On average, female early Social Security takers\nare less likely to be employed than postponers in\nincome of female early Social Security takers is less\nthan the median household income of female post-\nponers, especially in 1993. But unlike men, the net\nassets of the median female taker are substantially\ngreater than the median household net assets of the\nConversely, female takers are slightly less likely to be\neligible to receive employer pension income. In addi-\ntion, female takers are less likely to be in poverty in\n1993 than female postponers. While female early So-\ncial Security takers and postponers are far less likely\nto be receiving their own employer pension than\nmen, over one half of the households of females who\ntake early Social Security benefits received employer\nfemale postponers received such household pension\nincome (see Appendix, Note 13). These stylized facts\nsuggest that if there is a difference in economic well-\nbeing between female takers and postponers, female\ntakers on average have greater economic well-being\nthan female postponers.\nBecause the labor market experiences of men and\nwomen in the age cohort we are examining are very\ndifferent, we will continue to disaggregate by gen-\nder. But we will also subdivide our sample by two\nother important variables -- health and employer\npension benefit status. Some of our subpopulations\nhave rather small sample sizes, and the results\nshould be considered with caution.\nThe first group we define as healthy dual pension-\ners -- those who take Social Security retirement or\nspouse benefits while they are age 62 and who also\nreceive employment pension income in 1994, and\nwho in Wave 2 of the HRS do not report a health\nproblem that limits the type or amount of work they\nsecond and much smaller group is non-healthy dual\npensioners. The third group is healthy single pension-\ners-- those 62-year-old healthy Social Security recipi-\nents who do not receive employer pension income in\n1994. The fourth group is non-healthy single pension-\ners. The fifth and sixth groups are drawn from those\nwho, while age-eligible, did not take Social Security\nretirement or spousal benefits while they were age 62\n-- we refer to these individuals as postponers.\nHealthy postponers are those who do not report a\nhealth limit in 1994. Non-healthy postponers are\nthose who do report a health limit in 1994.\nTable 4, which looks at the men in our sample,\nshows that the lowest rates of employment in 1992\nappear more related to health status than to taker or\npostponer status. While 88% of healthy postponers\nwere employed, only 42% of nonhealthy postponers\nwere employed. Healthy single pensioners have em-\nployment rates much closer to healthy postponers\nthan to nonhealthy postponers -- 71%. Dual pen-\nsioners were about equally likely to work regardless\nof health status.\nPoor health also appears to be more closely associ-\nated with lower median household income in 1991,\nwhen these men were not yet age-eligible for Social\nSecurity benefits, than is subsequent taker or post-\nponer status. There is a much greater difference in\nmedian household income between healthy and\nnonhealthy groups, regardless of whether or not\nthey took Social Security benefits while they were\nage 62, than there is between takers and postponers\nwho are healthy or who are in poor health. Health\ndifferences also appear to be more closely associated\nwith poverty differences than differences in taker-\npostponer status.\nNet assets are the only exception to the general\npattern of the dominance of health status as a corre-\nlate of poor economic well-being. While the median\nhealthy taker (single or dual pensioner) and the me-\ndian healthy postponer had more net assets than the\nmedian nonhealthy postponer in 1992, the median\nnonhealthy dual pensioner had median net assets\nsecond only to healthy single pensioners in 1992.\nnet assets of nonhealthy dual postponers was $25,050\nand hence, by 1994, the median net assets of non-\nhealthy dual pensioners was below all three healthy\nment dropped for all groups, particularly the un-\nhealthy, but their relative group income positions\nremained virtually the same as in 1992. The very small\nsample sizes of the nonhealthy groups make any of\nthe values reported in Table 4 preliminary, but the\ngeneral trends are consistent. The economic dispari-\nties between the healthy and nonhealthy are not\nrelated solely to the receipt or nonreceipt of Social\nSecurity while age 62. Much of the observed differ-\nence existed in 1992 before they were old enough to\nreceive Social Security retirement benefits.\nIn Table 5 we repeat the analysis for women. The\nfindings are very similar with respect to the impor-\ntance of health. Even though a woman in this age\ncohort is not likely to be the dominant earner in a\nmarried couple, her health in 1994 is more closely\nassociated with the household's income, net assets,\nand poverty status both before and after her initial\neligibility than is the fact that she takes or postpones\nSocial Security benefits while she is age 62.\nIn Table 6 we once again compare early Social\nTable 4.

A larger\nshare of nonhealthy men postponed early Social\nSecurity benefits than took them, and they outnum-\nber nonhealthy single pensioners by almost 5 to 1.\nColumns two through five in Table 6 show the\nshare of income and poverty associated with each of\nthe six groups. In 1993, those taking early Social\nSecurity benefits received 24.3% of all income in our\nsample. Relative to their 34.6% share of the popula-\ntion, their share of income is disproportionately\nsmall. Their proportional share of income is .70 (24.3\ndivided by 34.6). They also experienced a higher\nthan proportional share of group poverty in 1993.\nThose who postponed acceptance of Social Secu-\nrity, on the other hand, received a larger than pro-\nportional share of income and experienced propor-\ntionately less poverty.\nBut as discussed previously, comparisons of eco-\nnomic well-being between men who have left the\nlabor force and begun taking Social Security benefits\nand those who postpone benefits exclude the value\nof added leisure time. Hence, the economic well-\nbeing of takers relative to those who postpone early\nSocial Security benefits is likely to be understated.

In 1991\nhealthy postponers controlled the greatest share of\nincome relative to their size but they were closely\nfollowed by healthy single and dual pensioners and\nonly distantly by nonhealthy postponers and takers.\nIn the second half of Table 6 we repeat this exer-\nsimilar. The income controlled by early Social Secu-\nrity takers and postponers is closer to proportional in\nonce again seen. Healthy dual pension takers and\nhealthy postponers have almost identically dispro-\nportionate shares in 1991, followed by healthy single\npensioners. Nonhealthy postponers and nonhealthy\ntakers follow the healthy single pensioners. Preva-\nlence of poverty shows a similar pattern with respect\nto health but is actually greater in 1991 for takers than\nBut as we have previously discussed, using income\nto measure economic well-being even for years just\nprior to age 62 is likely to exaggerate the differences\nin economic well-being between takers and post-\nponers. As was seen in Table 3, a large minority of\nmen have already left employment and started to\ntake employer pensions prior to age 62 and such men\nare disproportionately early Social Security takers.\nHence, gains in added leisure time for these men will\nbe disproportionately missed by income measures of\neconomic well-being.\nTable 7 is superior to Table 6 in two important\nways. First, it uses net assets rather than income as its\nmeasure of economic well-being and second, it al-\nlows us to substantially increase our sample size.\nBecause wealth is measured contemporaneously in\nthe HRS, we are able to include men and women who\nsample size slightly increases the share of the post-\nponer population but does not substantially change\nthe relative shares of those with and without health\nconditions and dual pension status across the\ngroups. Nonhealthy postponers continue to greatly\noutnumber nonhealthy takers and especially non-\nhealthy single pensioners. And dual pensioners con-\ntinue to outnumber single pensioners among takers.\nAs expected, net assets in 1994 are much more\nequally distributed than income in 1993 between\ntakers and postponers. While postponers control a\ngreater share of net assets than takers, it is only 104%\nConclusion\nThe labor force participation rate of men aged 62\nthrough 64 declined dramatically following the intro-\nduction of early Social Security benefits for men in\nipation rates have leveled off. Nonetheless, the great\nmajority of men take Social Security benefits before\nage 65, and around one third take these benefits\nwhile they are age 62. We have used preliminary data\nfrom the Health and Retirement Survey to look at\nTable 7. The Distribution of Net Assets in 1992 and 1994 for Men and Women by Health and Pension Status Groups'\nGroup\nAll Takers\"\nRatioc\nDual Pensioners\nHealthy\"\nRatioc\nNon-healthyb\nRatioc\nSingle Pensioners\nHealthy\"\nNon-healthyb\nRatioc\nAll Postponers\"\nPostponers\nHealthy\"\nRatioc\nNon-healthy\"\nRatioc\nMen\nShare of\nPopulation\n's Share of Net Assets\nWomen'\nShare of\nPopulation\n's Share of Net Assets\n\"Sample sizes of men's and women's samples are 580 and 655, respectively.\n\"Group share of population resources.\ncRatio of group share to share of group in the population. A value of 1.0 means the group has a share of net assets exactly proportional to\nits population share.\nsee if there are differences in income, health, and net\nassets between those who take Social Security bene-\nfits while they are age 62 and those who postpone\nbenefit acceptance past this age.\nContrary to conventional wisdom, we find that the\noverwhelming majority of male Social Security takers\nare in good health, and more than 6 in 10 are already\nreceiving an employer pension in addition to their\nSocial Security benefits. Less than 10% of male early\nSocial Security takers are both in poor health and\nhave Social Security as their only source of pension\nincome, and this group makes up less than 3% of the\npopulation of 62-year-old men. Only about two fe-\nmale early Social Security takers in 10 are both in\npoor health and have Social Security as their only\npersonal source of pension income. The majority of\nwomen who take early Social Security benefits while\nthey are age 62 are both healthy and live in a house-\nhold with employer pension income.\nThe economic well-being of early Social Security\ntakers, both men and women, when measured by\nhousehold income, is on average lower than the\neconomic well-being of postponers, but because\ntakers work less than postponers and the value of\nleisure is ignored in such an income measure, this\ndifference is exaggerated by simple comparisons of\nincome around age 62. In fact, the median earlier\nSocial Security taker is found to have more net assets\nthan the median postponer. When we use net assets\nas a measure of economic well-being, the differ-\nences between the two groups are much smaller.\nWhat we show, however, is that relatively small\ndifferences between the median early Social Security\ntaker and postponer mask large differences within\nthe groups with respect to economic well-being.\nBoth early Social Security takers and postponers who\nare healthy live in households whose income and net\nassets are greater than those of nonhealthy takers\nand postponers. Also, both takers and postponers\nwho are healthy are less likely to live in poverty than\nare nonhealthy takers or postponers. Hence, while\nnonhealthy men (less than one in five) and women\n(about one in four) are a minority of the retirement\nage population, they are at far greater risk of lower\neconomic well-being and poverty than are the\nhealthy majority, regardless of whether or not they\ntake early Social Security benefits.\nOur results suggest that raising the early Social\nSecurity retirement age is not likely to dramatically\nlower the economic well-being of the typical person\naged 62, since the majority of men and women aged\nmore importantly, the majority of those who do take\nSocial Security benefits while they are age 62 are\nneither in poor health nor dependent on Social Secu-\nrity benefits alone for their pension income. None-\ntheless, a small minority of men and women aged 62\nare in poor health and, on average, they live in\nhouseholds with substantially less income and net\nassets than the healthy majority. When raising the\nearly retirement age, other policies should be put in\nplace that provide some alternative source of income\nfor this relatively small minority of vulnerable older\npersons.\nReferences\nBoard of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and\nDisability Insurance Trust Funds.

The evidence of increased life expectancy in the\nUnited States is universally accepted. See, for in-\nstance, Department of Health and Human Services\n(1991) for a summary of this evidence and projections\nof future changes in life expectancy. The evidence with\nrespect to whether longer life is increasingly associ-\nated with better rather than worse health is less power-\nful but tends to support the view that health has also\nimproved. See, for instance, Crimmins, Saito, and\nand most recently Manton, Stallard, and Corder (1995).\n4. Quinn (1987) first observed that while the average\neconomic well-being of older people has dramatically\nincreased since the 1960s, pockets of poverty persist.\nSee Holtz-Eakin and Smeeding (1994) for a recent anal-\nysis of the economic well-being of older persons.\n5. As is true of most economic datasets -- Current Popula-\ntion Survey (CPS), Panel Study of Income Dynamics,\netc. -- while most information is based on conditions at\nthe time of the survey, information on income is based\non the previous year. Hence, in the HRS, Wave 1 con-\ntains employment, health, and net asset characteristics\ncontains employment, health, and net asset character-\n6. It is important to note that for this article eligibility is\ngauged solely by age. As will be seen, some people with\nhealth limitations are observed to not take Social Secu-\nrity benefits while they are age 62. One reason may be\nthat they are in fact ineligible. For this reason and\nothers mentioned elsewhere in the article, all of the\nconclusions presented here should be seen as prelimi-\nnary in nature. When matched data from Social Security\nrecords become available, it will be possible to further\nrefine our sample to exclude those who are not in the\npopulation of potential recipients while age 62.\n7. While Social Security retirement or spouse benefits\ncannot be received prior to age 62, it is possible to\nreceive Social Security disability benefits or widow\nbenefits at younger ages. Since those receiving such\nbenefits will not be directly affected by an increase in\nthe early retirement age for Social Security, we exclude\nthose persons receiving such benefits from our analy-\nsis. If an individual age 62 receives a joint benefit with\ntheir spouse who is also age 62, each of them is\ncounted as a beneficiary, and each is considered inde-\npendently in the data. A data appendix that provides a\nmore complete discussion of the sample will be pro-\nvided by the authors upon request.\n8. One reason why our percentage employed is greater\nthan the CPS labor force participation rate is that we\nexclude from the sample all men who receive Social\nSecurity disability benefits prior to age 62. Presumably\nnone of these men would be employed.\n9. This is only one of the available health measures in the\nHRS. We replicated the tables in this study using self-\nreported health (good, bad, etc.) and found similar\nresults. As our analysis focuses on the nexus between\nearly Social Security benefit receipt, health, and em-\nployment, our work impairment measure seems best\nsuited to the topic.\n10. Net assets in this article is defined as the sum of the net\nvalue of real estate, transportation, businesses,\nchecking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit,\nIRA and Keogh accounts, stocks and mutual funds,\nbonds, and a miscellaneous category for assets and\ndebts not covered in the previous groups. The asset\nvalues of pensions (employer and Social Security) are\nnot included in this measure of net assets. For a more\ncomplete discussion of our calculation of net assets,\nsee Table 2.\n11. Eventually the wealth value of private pensions will be\nincluded with the HRS data. It was not available at the\ntime we were writing this paper.\n12. The preliminary version of Wave 2 HRS data we are\nusing did not have a reliable measure of pension eligi-\nbility at the time of this writing. But pension eligibility,\nunlike acceptance, is unlikely to change over the two-\nyear period. Hence, it appears the vast majority of\nthose eligible to receive a private pension who take\nearly Social Security benefits also take their private\n13. One reason for the difference in household pension\nincome is that only 58% of female postponers were\n14. We subdivide early Social Security takers by health and\npension status to identify those likely to be most vul-\nnerable to drops in economic well-being if Social Secu-\nrity benefits were available at age 62 -- those in poor\nhealth and without other sources of pension income.\nWe had the choice of using a variable identifying those\nreceiving pension income or a variable identifying\neligibility for pension income as our measure of pen-\nsion status. We chose pension income even though\npension eligibility is likely to be a better gauge of\npension wealth because the pension eligibility variable\nin the preliminary Wave 2 release of data is relatively\nunclean with several missing values. However, when\nwe used this eligibility measure, only eight men and\nwomen moved from the healthy single pension group\nto the healthy dual pension group. Since the results of\nour analysis do not significantly change as a result of\nusing either definition of employer pension status, we\nutilize the \"cleaner\" pension receipt variable to create\nour subgroups.\n15. This sizeable reduction in median net assets is based\non a small sample (19 individuals). Nonetheless, this\nloss does not appear to be associated with any sizeable\nloss of household income over the period. This\nsuggests that changes in health status from good to\nbad (notice that 53% of this population reports good\nhealth two years earlier) may have a greater impact on\nnet assets than on income. Presumably, this is because\nof the availability of dual pension income when a\nhealth condition begins to affect one's ability to work.\nWhile we observe this classic protective attribute of\nour dual pension system among this group, it is\nimportant to note that deteriorating health is not the\ntypical experience of dual pensioners, most of whom\nare healthy in both periods."
