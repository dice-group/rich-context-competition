More specifically, the paper investigates the impact of taxation on the de-\ncision of German multinationals to hold a direct investment at a specific foreign location.\nFurthermore, as questionnaires among executives emphasize the significance of statutory\ntax rates as compared to effective tax rates (e.g., S\u00f8rensen, 1992), the predictive power of\nalternative indicators of taxing incentives is tested.\nExploiting the panel-data features of the dataset in order to control for firm-specific differ-\nences in the valuation of potential locations, the results confirm significant effects of labor\ncost, market size, and tax incentives on international cross-border location decisions. In\naccordance with Devereux and Griffith (1998) we find that the marginal tax rate has no\npredictive power for location decisions whereas effective average and statutory tax rates\nexert strong effects.\nThe next section lays out the investigation approach. This is followed by a short description\nof the data set. Another section presents the empirical results, before a final section draws\nsome conclusions.\n2 Investigation Approach\nConsider the location decision for the affiliate of a German multinational indexed by k.\nWith some positive probability pi,k\nthis affiliate will be placed at location i. In the standard\nview of tax competition location choice is regarded as an increasing function of expected\nprofits, which in turn are determined by taxes i\nand other local conditions xi\n. If the choice\nset is large this can be formalized as\npi,k\n= f (k\n(i\n, xi\n)) ,\nwhere xi\nis a vector of local characteristics and k\nrepresents expected profits in the view\nof firm k. The current investigation basically employs a sample of multinationals in order\nto estimate a linearized version of this relationship\npi,k\n= yk\n + i\n + i\n+ xi\n + i,k\n,\nwhere i,k\nis a residual variable. Note that in this simple specification firm-specific effects, as\ncaptured by yk\n, are assumed to be orthogonal to the location characteristics, as captured\nby i\n + i\n+ xi\n. However, despite this simplification, the pure cross-sectional tax effect \nis basically unidentified since the impact of taxes and of known characteristics xi\nis already\nencompassed by the location-specific or country effects i\n. But, if one is willing to assume\nthat unobserved local determinants of location choice are time-invariant, and if there is\nsome variation in tax incentives over time, a possible solution is to pool observations for\ndifferent periods and to estimate the tax equation using panel data. Accordingly, the\nempirical analysis might be concerned with the relationship\npi,k,t\n= yk\n + i,t\n + i\n+ xi,t\n + t\n+ i,k,t\nwhere t\nis a time-specific effect. Note that the panel data structure considered here is\nthe pooling of investment decisions across countries and time. Given the assumption that\nfirm effects are orthogonal to location as well as time effects, in this setting the presence of\nfirm-level panel data only helps to control for some differences between companies and to\nsolve aggregation problems but not to discriminate taxation effects from unknown location\ncharacteristics.\nHowever, given the availability of firm-level panel data, the assumption that firm effects\nare orthogonal to location effects is overly restrictive. An alternative approach would allow\nfor firm-specific location effects. Intuitively, this approach would assume that each firm\nhas some idiosyncratic valuation of locations. Identification of tax and other locational\ncharacteristics is then only possible using the variation of those characteristics over time\nwithin each firm-location cell. Formally, estimation would then require to allow for a full\nset of firm-location or firm-country effects i,k\npi,k,t\n= yk\n + i,t\n + i,k\n+ xi,t\n + t\n+ i,k,t\nIn principle, standard panel data estimation techniques might be used to estimate this\nrelationship. But, the inclusion of individual effects is not straightforward in the current\nsetting due to the binary nature of the observed dependent variable (firm k either holds an\ninvestment at i or not). Some firms will hold an investment at a specific location during\nall periods; other firms will not hold an investment at this location in any period. Thus,\nfirm-specific location effects will perfectly predict the outcome in these two cases. As a\nconsequence, appropriate estimators such as the fixed-effects logit approach proposed by\nChamberlain (1984) focus on a firm's investment in a country only if we observe some\nchanges in location decisions over time.\nThe empirical analysis basically uses the micro database for FDI provided by the German\nBundesbank. This is a comprehensive annual database of direct investment positions of\nGerman enterprises held abroad as well as of direct investment positions held in Germany\nby foreign companies. A favorable characteristic of the dataset is the possibility to trace the\ndirect investment positions of individual firms over time. In this study we utilize firm-level\nThe collection of the data is enforced by German law, which determines reporting man-\ndates for certain international transactions.2 With regard to outward FDI, each German\nenterprise has to report its foreign assets, provided asset holdings are above some thres-\nhold level. In the year 2000 some 8,500 domestic investors returned reports on their foreign\ndirect investment. In 2000 in the case of minority participations (greater 10 % and lower\n50 %) reporting is mandatory if the balance sheet total of the direct investment exceeds 5\nmillion euros; in the case of majority participations, direct investments have to be reported\nif their balance sheet total is above 0.5 million euro. The database also contains indirect\nFDI relations, which must be reported if a direct investment enterprise held by a majority\nparticipation holds 10% or more of another enterprise.\nA problem with the data is that threshold levels vary over time (see Lipponer, 2003). More\nspecifically, as compared to the year 2000 in the considered time period they tend to be\nlower in previous years. In order to make sure that the results are not subject to some\nbias originating in the resulting panel attrition, the current study consistently employs a\nuniform threshold level at which observations are included in the sample. Hence, direct\ninvestments are only included if the current investment position is above the threshold\nTax incentives are captured by statutory, effective marginal, and effective average tax rates\non investment in the corporate sector of the host country taken from Devereux, Griffith, and\nKlemm (2002). Note that Germany usually exempts earnings of German affiliates abroad.\nHence, the tax burden at the location of the affiliate is decisive from the point of view of\nGerman companies. Given the short time period of the analysis most of other potential\nlocation characteristics are probably captured by country effects. However, presumably\n2\u00a726 Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz (Law on Foreign Trade and Payments) in connection with Aussen-\nwirtschaftsverordnung (Foreign Trade and Payment Regulations).\n3While the uniformity of threshold levels across years proved important, note that variations in the\ndefinition of the threshold level have been found to have only minor effects on the estimation results.\ntime-variant location conditions such as market sizes and labor cost are captured by OECD\ndata on GDP and hourly labor cost as provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the\nU.S. Department of Labor.\nFor our purposes we exclude FDI in the financial sector, since we are basically interested\nin the tax effects on real investment decisions. We also exclude direct investments, which\nare made in branches or partnerships, since in such cases other effective or statutory tax\nrates apply as in the corporate sector.\nTable (1) provides descriptive statistics of the dataset. Note that the number of observa-\ntions reflects the whole set of possible locations for each enterprize. More specifically, for\neach company in the dataset in a given year there are 15 separate observations indicat-\ning whether or not a positive foreign direct investment is held separately for each of the\ncountries considered.\nAs discussed above the empirical analysis of location decisions involves the estimation of\nlocation probabilities depending on location and firm characteristics. The logarithm of\nGDP is used as a proxy variable for the size of the foreign market, the logarithm of hourly\ncompensation of employees in manufacturing is used as an indicator of labor cost. As it is\nvery difficult to account for other locational conditions like public services or agglomeration\neffects we also include dummy variables for each country in the sample in order to control\nfor unobserved country characteristics. In order to further reduce the consequences of\nheterogeneity in the sample on the results, we include dummy-variables for the legal status\nof the mother as one of the few available characteristics of the German investor in the\ndataset, unless we explicitly allow for individual firm-effects in the estimations.\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\nVariable Mean Std.Dev.

Standard errors (in\nparentheses) robust against heteroscedasticity and random firm effects. A star denotes\nsignificance at the 10 % level.\nTable (2) shows the results of a basic linear regression of the probability of holding a direct\ninvestment in each of 12 major countries of the European Union, in the U.S., in Canada or\nin Japan, on three different tax measures, namely the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR),\nthe effective average tax rate (EATR, calculated at a rate of return of 10 %) and the\nstatutory tax rate (STR). In order to avoid the Moulton (1990) problem, standard errors\nare robust against random firm effects using the usual Huber-White sandwich formula.\nThe three indicators of the tax burden show different results. While the marginal and\neffective average tax rates prove insignificant, the statutory tax rate shows a significant\nnegative impact. However, GDP proves insignificant as well, and labor cost even show\nan unexpected positive impact. Quantitatively, the estimated impact of the statutory tax\nrate suggests that an increase of the statutory tax rate by 10 percentage points reduces the\nprobability to observe a foreign direct investment by about 0.51 percentage points: given\nan average sample probability of 0.13 this is a relative reduction by 4 %.\nThe linear probability model fails to take account of the binary nature of the dependent\nvariable. Making specific assumptions about the probability distribution of the presence\nof a direct investment conditional on covariates more efficient estimates can be obtained\nfrom corresponding non-linear estimators such as probit or logit. Table 3 provides results.\nThe first panel reports results from probit, the second from random-effects probit and the\nthird panel reports results from logit models. All estimates report robust standard errors.\nNow, both the statutory as well as the effective average tax rate prove significant. With\nregard to the marginal probability effects, quantitatively, the results on the tax rates are\nquite similar as in the linear model. However, some estimates confirm the unexpected\npositive coefficient on the labor cost, and the estimations without random effects tend to\nsupport a significant impact of GDP. While the random effects probit estimation shows\nsomewhat weaker results, the logit estimates yield almost identical marginal effects to the\nprobit model.\nGiven the strong significance of GDP and, partly, of labor cost in other studies of FDI\n(e.g., Pain, 2003, or Billington, 1999) its insignificance points to the difficulty to distinguish\ncountry characteristics from the country-fixed effects. However, as suggested above, the\nfirm-level data allow us to take account of firm-specific valuations of the attractiveness of\nlocations by means of firm-specific country effects. As these effects would perfectly predict\ndecisions if a firm holds a direct investment or does not hold any direct investments during\nthe whole reporting period at a specific location, we restrict attention to those observations\nwhere a change in the location decision for each firm-country cell is observed at least once in\nthe period analyzed. Table 4 provides results from a corresponding linear probability model\nallowing for firm-specific country effects. Note first that the number of observations is\ndrastically reduced which reflects the removal of all observations where a direct investment\nposition is or is not observed for a firm in the total time period considered. As most of\nthe firm-country-cells report zero investments the reduced sample shows a much higher\naverage probability to observe a direct investment (0.51 as compared to 0.13 in the basic\nTable 3: Results: Discrete Probability Models\nProbit\nCoefficient Slope Coefficient Slope Coefficient Slope\nDummies for country, time, and legal status of mother included.

While statutory and effective average tax rates show significant negative effects\nthe marginal effective tax rate, again, proves insignificant. The GDP now shows significant\npositive effects and the labor cost variable no longer shows the unexpected positive sign\nbut shows a significant negative effect.\nQuantitatively, the estimated impact of the statutory tax rate seems much larger than\nin the previous estimations suggesting that an increase of the statutory tax rate by 10\npercentage points reduces the probability to observe a direct investment by about 4.8\npercentage points. Given the higher sample probability to observe a direct investment, the\nrelative reduction in the probability is about 9.4 % which is roughly twice as large than\nin the basic estimations. Also the impact of the effective average tax rate is increased: an\nincrease by 10 percentage points reduces the probability to observe a direct investment by\n5.9 %. Despite of its smaller coefficient, the standard error of the effective average tax rate\nis not much smaller, indicating that the estimate is less precise. However, it has to be noted\nthat the EATR assumes a specific rate of return, which may not be representative for all\nTable 5: Results: Discrete Probability Model with Firm-Specific Country Effects\nmethod Logit-FE Logit-FE Logit-FE\nEstimation with fixed effects for each firm-country cell.

With regard to the labor cost the results from the first\nspecification using the statutory tax rate indicate that a doubling of the labor cost reduces\nthe probability to observe a direct investment by 12.5 percentage points. Evaluated at\nthe mean level of labor cost in the sample of 16.8 U.S. $ per hour, this indicates that an\nincrease in the labor cost by 10 U.S. $ would result in a relative reduction of the location\nNow, the linear probability model neglects the presence of a qualitative dependent variable.\nTable 5 reports results from the fixed-effects logit model. Qualitatively, the results confirm\nthe findings from the linear model. The signs of the coefficients are the same, and also\nthe significance against zero effects is confirmed. The interpretation is, however, slightly\ndifferent, as the coefficients report the impact on the log odds ratio. Hence, an increase of\nthe statutory tax rate by 10 percentage points reduces the odds of an investment by about\n20 %. With regard to the labor cost we find that doubling the labor cost reduces the odds\nTable 6: Results: Discrete Probability Model with Firm-Specific Country Effects, EU\ncountries only\nmethod Logit-FE Logit-FE Logit-FE\nEstimation with fixed effects for each firm-country cell. Time-specific effects included.\nStandard errors (in parentheses).\nby about 50 %. In terms of the above example of an increase in the labor cost by 10 US $\nthe odds would fall by about 30 %.\nThe 15 countries selected are quite heterogenous, including EU member states as well as \u00ad\nfrom a German perspective \u00ad rather distant locations such as U.S., Canada, and Japan. It\nseems quite likely that tax incentives and other locational conditions have a different impact\nat least for these two subsets of countries. Table 6 reports results only for the location\ndecision within the EU. As compared to the estimations for the full sample, while the tax\nrate effects are similar, the sensitivity with regard to GDP and labor cost is increased.\nHowever, partly reflecting the smaller sample the standard errors are increased as well.\n5 Conclusions\nThe aim of the paper is to test empirically the influence of taxation on the decision of Ger-\nman multinationals to hold a foreign direct investment at a specific location. In difference\nto most of the literature this paper uses a firm-level dataset to study location decisions.\nWhile this raises difficulties in combining data at the firm as well as at the country level, it\nenhances possibilities to identify tax incentives relative to other possibly unknown country\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, as questionnaires among executives emphasize the signifi-\ncance of statutory tax rates as compared to effective tax rates, the predictive power of\nalternative indicators of taxing incentives is tested.\nThe analysis first of all documents the difficulties to identify tax incentives and other\nlocational characteristics against simple location or country effects. While supporting an\nimpact of the statutory tax rate, basic regressions yield mixed and partly unexpected results\nfor control variables such as labor cost and GDP even if the non-linearities arising from\nthe binary dependent variable are taken into account. Only when allowing for firm-specific\nvaluation of a country's attractiveness, significant effects can be established not only for\nstatutory tax rates but also for the effective average tax rate, the market size, as captured\nby the GDP, and the labor cost. The results indicate that an increase in the statutory tax\nrate by 10 percentage points reduces the odds to observe some positive direct investment\nby approximately 20 %; for the effective average tax rate the corresponding figure is 12.5\n%. With regard to the labor cost variable the estimated impact suggests that an increase\nin the labor cost by 10 U.S. $ per hour reduces the odds to observe an investment by about\nIn conditioning on firm-specific country effects the sample is, however, considerably reduced\nand attention is focused on those multinationals which are revealed to alter their location\ndecisions in the six-year period considered. Thus, the stronger results for this sub-sample\nare likely caused by a larger fraction of footloose industries and, in this respect, may not\nbe representative for all German multinationals.\nIn order to test whether the more advanced degree of integration within the EU shows up\nin an increased sensitivity to tax incentives, separate estimations have been carried out\nfor the European Union countries. While the results point to an increased sensitivity of\nlocation decisions with regard to market size and labor cost, however, the tax incentives\nshow effects similar to those in the complete sample.\nAmong the different indicators of tax incentives, the statutory tax rate has the strongest\npredictive power and yields the strongest effects. In contrast, the marginal effective tax\nrate is not significant at all. Given the significance of the effective average tax rate this is in\naccordance with Devereux and Griffith (1998) who argue that the effective average rather\nthan the marginal tax rate matters for location decisions. However, one could speculate\nwhether the weaker predictive power of the effective average tax rate as compared to the\nstatutory tax rate may indicate that uncertainties in the rate of return or in the applicability\nof certain deductions lead investors to rely on the statutory tax rate. But it also could\nsimply reflect differences in the rate of return of investment projects which might give rise\nto a measurement error problem.\nDatasources and Definitions\nFirm-level data are taken from the micro-dataset of the Bundesbank, see Lipponer\nGDP in U.S. Dollars, nominal.
