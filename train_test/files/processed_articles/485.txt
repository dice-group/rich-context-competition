In part, this reflects absence of longit-\nudinal investigations of links between offending and its pre-\ncursors, and illness and injury.\nProspective longitudinal data on both offending and morbid-\nity are available however, from the Cambridge Study of Delin-\nquent Development (CSDD) and have been studied to find out\nhow illness and injury relate to concurrent offending, whether\noffending predicts illness and injury or vice versa and whether\nrelations persist after adjustment for childhood predictors of\noffending.1 When information about injuries and illnesses\nbetween ages 16 and 18 was set against information on offend-\ning and other types of antisocial behaviour, it was found that\nmales who were injured, especially in assaults, tended to be\nconvicted, to be violent, to have unskilled manual jobs and to\nbe generally antisocial. Surprisingly, respiratory tract illnesses\nwere negatively related to convictions and antisocial behaviour\nin general. However, illicit drug users were significantly likely to\nbe ill. Adult convictions were predicted by childhood trouble-\nsome behaviour, daring/hyperactivity, low IQ/attainment, a\nconvicted parent, family disruption/poor supervision and\npoverty. Assault injuries and respiratory tract illnesses did not\npredict adult convictions independently of these childhood fac-\ntors. This first longitudinal study of offending and health con-\ncluded that injury is one symptom of an antisocial personality\nwhich arises in childhood and persists into adulthood and there-\nfore, that measures that lead to a reduction in offending (like\npre-school education and early family support) should also lead\nto a reduction in concurrent injuries. It was concluded that the\nobserved negative relation between a range of antisocial\nbehaviours and respiratory tract illness deserved further investi-\nThe study reported here was designed to do this by investi-\ngating relations between childhood predictors of delinquency,\nteenage offending and other delinquent behaviour, injury and\nillness at age 16\u00ad18; and offending and health measures 14 years\nlater, at age 27\u00ad32. This second investigation using data from\nthe same longitudinal study was driven by four hypotheses: first,\nthat the observed association between convictions and more\ninjury observed at age 18 would be maintained at age 32;\nImpact of antisocial lifestyle on health\nJonathan Shepherd, David Farrington and John Potts\nJournal of Public Health vol. 26 no. 4 \u00a9 Faculty of Public Health 2004; all rights reserved.\n1Violence and Society Research Group, University of Wales College of Medicine,\n2Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge, 7 West Road, Cambridge\n1Jonathan Shepherd, Professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n2David Farrington, Professor of Psychological Criminology\n1John Potts, Senior Lecturer in Pathology\nAddress correspondence to Professor Jonathan Shepherd.\nE-mail: shepherdjp@cardiff.ac.uk\nsecondly, that associations between childhood predictors of\ndelinquency and more injury would be maintained at age 32;\nthirdly, that measures of antisocial behaviour at age 18 would\nbe linked to more injury at age 32; and fourthly, that the\nobserved association between childhood predictors, concurrent\nmeasures of delinquency and decreased illness observed at age\n18 would be reversed by age 32. In relation to this fourth\nhypothesis, it was considered that although links between heavy\ndrinking, heavy smoking and illness were not present at age\n16\u00ad18, these threats to health (linked to antisocial behaviour)\nwould have begun to take their toll in terms of measurable\nimpacts on health by a decade and a half later.\nMethods\nThe Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development\nResearch methods adopted in this study are described in a\nreport of an investigation of links between offending, injuries\nand illness up to the age of 18.1 In summary, the CSDD is a\nprospective longitudinal survey of the development of offending\nand antisocial behaviour in 411 London males. At the time they\nclass city area of South London. The sample was all the boys\nwho were then aged 8\u00ad9 and on the registers of six state primary\nschools within a 1 mile radius of a research office that had been\nestablished. Hence, the most common year of birth of these\nmales was 1953. In nearly all cases (94 per cent), the family\nbreadwinner at that time, usually the father, had a working class\noccupation (skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual worker).\nMost of the males were white (97 per cent) and of British origin.\nThe original aim of the study was to describe the development\nof delinquent and criminal behaviour in inner city males, to\ninvestigate how far it could be predicted in advance, and to\nexplain why juvenile delinquency began, why it did or did not\ncontinue into adult crime, and why adult crime usually ended as\nmen reached their 20s. A major aim in this study was to measure\nas many factors as possible that might be causes or correlates of\noffending. Reflecting this, in the research reported here, injury\nand illness data were studied 20 years after data collection\nbecause previously, no hypotheses relating to health outcomes\nhad been considered. Recently, prompted by the authors'\nconcern that antisocial lifestyle may have unknown effects on\nhealth, and by the availability of relevant longitudinal data, this\nstudy was undertaken.\nInterviews and tests\nThe males were interviewed and tested in their schools by male\nor female psychologists when they were aged about 8, 10 and 14.\nThey were interviewed in a research office at about 16, 18 and 21\nand in their homes at about 25 and 32 by young male social\nscience graduates. At all ages, except 21 and 25, the aim was to\ninterview the whole sample, and it was always possible to trace\nand interview a high proportion \u00ad for example, 389 out of 410\nage 32 (94 per cent). The tests in schools measured individual\ncharacteristics, such as intelligence, attainment, personality and\npsychomotor impulsivity, while information was collected in\nthe interviews about such topics as living circumstances,\nemployment histories, relationships with females, leisure activ-\nities such as drinking and fighting and offending behaviour.\nIn addition to these interviews and tests, the boys' parents\nwere interviewed by female social workers who visited their\nhome. This happened about once a year from when the male\nwas about 8 until he was aged 14\u00ad15 and in his last year of com-\npulsory education. The primary informant was the mother,\nalthough many fathers were also seen. The parents provided\ndetails about such matters as family income, family size, their\nemployment histories, their child rearing practices (including\nattitudes, discipline and parental disharmony), their degree of\nsupervision of the boy and his temporary or permanent separa-\ntions from them. Teachers completed questionnaires when the\nabout their troublesome and aggressive school behaviour, their\nattention deficits, their school attainments and their truancy.\nRatings were also obtained from their peers when they were in\nprimary school, about such topics as their daring, dishonesty,\ntroublesomeness and popularity.2\nFor the analyses described in this paper, each predictor vari-\nable was dichotomized as far as possible into the `worst' quarter\n(e.g. the quarter with lowest income or lowest intelligence)\nversus the remainder. This was done in order the compare the\nimportance of different variables and also to permit a risk factor\napproach. Because most variables were originally classified into\na small number of categories and because fine distinctions\nbetween categories could not be made very accurately, this\ndichotomizing did not usually involve a great loss of informa-\ntion. The one quarter/three quarters split was chosen to match\nthe prior expectation that about one quarter of the sample\nwould be convicted as juveniles.2\nSearches were also conducted in the central Criminal Record\nOffice (National Identification Bureau) in London to try to\nlocate findings of guilt of the males, of their parents, of their\nbrothers and sisters and later of their wives and cohabitees. The\nminimum age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is\n10. The Criminal Record Office contains records of all serious\noffences committed in Great Britain or Ireland and also acts as a\nrepository for records of minor juvenile offences committed in\nLondon. Convictions were only counted if they were for\noffences normally recorded in the Criminal Record Office, such\nas thefts, burglaries, violence, vandalism and drug use. In this\npaper, the recorded age of offending is the age at which an\noffence was committed, not the age of conviction.\nHealth data\nInjury and illness data were recorded for the 2 year period when\nsubjects were aged 16\u00ad18 and for the 5 year period when they\nwere aged 27\u00ad32 in the following manner. Interviewers recorded\nall the illnesses that led to absences from work of a week or more\n\u00ad or equivalent if not working, what was wrong, when the illness\noccurred, how it was managed, how many days off work it\ncaused and the length of time if any in hospital. Men were also\nasked about operations and treatment that had been required.\nAccounts of these illnesses were amplified by the interviewers in\nfree text. Information about injuries was recorded in precisely\nthe same way except that men were asked about the circum-\nstances and causes of injury.\nThe illnesses and injuries recorded by the interviewers were\ntranslated into Read clinical codes, version 3.1. On the basis of\nthe Read codes, assigned illnesses were grouped into respiratory,\ncardiovascular, musculoskeletal, skin, allergic, gastrointestinal\nand psychological/neurological disorders. Injuries were charac-\nterized by their cause. The main causes of injury were assault,\nmotorcycle, home and work accidents and sport. Data were ana-\nlysed by means of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.\nResults\n(27 per cent) experienced an injury at age 27\u00ad32 compared with\nobservation period from 2 to 5 years. The most common type of\nillness was infection \u00ad mostly respiratory tract disease [such as\nfollowed by gastrointestinal disease [such as appendicitis, ulcer,\nskin disease [for example, acne, boils, dermatitis, shingles:\n2 per cent (9 per cent at age 16\u00ad18)], allergic illness [including\nhayfever, allergic reaction, asthma, eczema: 0.5 per cent (5 per\ncent at age 16\u00ad18)] and psychological/neurological disorders\n[such as migraine, depression, nervous rash, nervous break-\ndown: 3 per cent (5 per cent at age 16\u00ad18)]. The most common\ncategory of injury was work injury [11 per cent (21 per cent at\nassault injury [1 per cent (8 per cent at age 16\u00ad18)], and home\nIn the following sections, Tables 1\u00ad5 present only the signific-\nant findings among the very large number of correlations studied.\nIllness and injury versus offending (Table 2)\nMen who were injured on the roads between ages 27 and 32 were\nsignificantly more likely to be convicted at some stage, particu-\nlarly between 19 and 32. There were also significant links\nbetween self and home injury and convictions after age 22.\nThere were significant links between psychological disorders\nwas also a link between age of conviction and the chances of\npsychological disorder; the strongest link was between concur-\nrent convictions at 19\u00ad40 and psychological disorders. Overall\nhowever, there were highly significant negative relations between\nillness, particularly organic illness, and convictions.\nConcurrent antisocial behaviour (Table 3)\nThere were few significant links between measures of concurrent\nantisocial behaviour, illness and injury. Again, both negative\nand positive correlations were found: negative relations between\nhospital admission and self-reported delinquency (SRD), but\npositive relations between illness overall, psychological illness\nand SRD and drug use.\nThe most striking links were negative associations between\nheavy alcohol consumption at age 16\u00ad18 and later infections/\norganic illness.

The risk of\npsychological illness was more than threefold higher for those\nwho reported fighting after drinking at age 16\u00ad18.

Not surprisingly, there were far fewer\nsignificant links between these precursors, and injury and illness\nwere found between childhood hyperactivity/low concentration\nand work injury 15 years later, and the strongest positive corre-\nlations were between high neuroticism at age 14 and skin\ndisorders; and between poor parental supervision and cardio-\nvascular disorders.\nDiscussion\nMost interestingly perhaps, the results of this and an earlier\nstudy of links between an antisocial lifestyle, injury and illness at\nage 16\u00ad18, both show some striking negative relationships. For\nexample, convictions were associated with fewer respiratory\nillnesses at age 16\u00ad18 and fewer illnesses overall and fewer\norganic illnesses at age 27\u00ad32. Furthermore, concurrent anti-\nsocial behaviour was inversely related to respiratory infections\nhood precursors linked to lower risk of infections at age 16\u00ad18\nwere daring and low income. These links had disappeared by\nage 27\u00ad32 but new inverse relations had, by then, become\napparent. For example, at 27\u00ad32 lower risk of work injury was\nlinked to childhood hyperactivity and low concentration. Further\ninverse relations were found between antisocial behaviour at\nage 18 and health outcomes at age 27\u00ad32 \u00ad principally between\nheavy alcohol consumption, infections and organic illness.\nOverall, there is clearly some stability in these negative\nrelationships. Potential explanations relate to the protective\neffect in terms of infection risk of large family size;1 a propensity\nof offenders not to take time off work; and some protective\neffect of infections on offending \u00ad for example, through limiting\noutdoor activity or physical fitness. One of the most important\nstudies of protective factors and resilience was carried out by\nWerner and Smith,3 who followed up over 500 Hawaii children\nfrom birth to age 32. They identified one-third of the children\nas high-risk because they were born into poverty and experi-\nenced perinatal stress, family discord or divorce, parental\nalcoholism or mental illness. One-third of these high-risk\nchildren were considered to be resilient, because they had no\ncrime record or mental illness by age 18, and most of them grew\nup into competent, successful adults at age 32. However, inter-\nestingly, the resilient children were more likely to have health\nproblems at age 32 (e.g. ulcers, chronic back problems, obesity,\ndizziness or fainting spells) than high-risk children who became\noffenders (54.5 per cent compared with 10.3 per cent for males).\nModerate alcohol consumption is known to be associated\nwith decreased risk of respiratory tract infections.4 It is also pos-\nsible that antisocial individuals neglect illness or seek treatment\nless often.5 Whatever the mechanism, this protective effect\nextended to fewer hospital admissions by age 32. Furthermore,\nself-reported delinquency at 32 was also negatively related to\nhospital admission at the same age. On the other hand, by age\n32, earlier antisocial behaviours, like fighting after drinking and\nheavy smoking, had become linked to illness \u00ad particularly\npsychological and skin disorders; and low job status was posi-\ntively related to hospital admission.\nTherefore, an antisocial lifestyle and its childhood pre-\ncursors seem to be associated with both negative and positive\nhealth outcomes. Interestingly, one physiological measure, low\nheart rate at age 16\u00ad18, was positively associated with injury at\ndisorders at age 27\u00ad32. This fits with the concept that physical\nfitness \u00ad one of the causes of low heart rate \u00ad carries with it both\nthe risk of injury and cardiovascular protection.\nOverall, a consistent finding up to age 32, was links between\nconvictions, concurrent antisocial behaviour, childhood pre-\ncursors of antisocial behaviour and injury. These links were\nmuch stronger at age 16\u00ad18 when both injury and conviction\nrates were much higher, than at age 27\u00ad32. However, against a\nbackground of work and sport injury at both ages, assault\n(only four men reported assault injury at 27\u00ad32 compared to 29\nat age 16\u00ad18). This fits with the known peak ages for antisocial\nbehaviour in boys and also with desistance from offending after\nthe age of about 20.\nThe other principal differences between relations at the two\nTable 5 Childhood precursors of injury and illness at age 32\nInjury/Illness at 32 Precursor at 8\u00ad10 years Odds ratio 95% Confidence interval\nages were significant links between convictions and self-reported\ndelinquency and psychological disorders at age 27\u00ad32, which\nwere not found at age 16\u00ad18. There was also an age response\neffect from age 19 up to age 32, with convictions an increasingly\npowerful predictor of psychological disorders.\nReturning to the hypotheses which informed this research,\nthese findings indicate that the positive relationship between\nantisocial behaviour and injury observed at age 16\u00ad18 was\nmaintained up to at least 32 years of age, though the prevalence\nof injury fell markedly. Secondly, whilst, overall negative rela-\ntions between convictions and illness remained, the corrosive\neffect on mental health of convictions was apparent by age 32.\nInterestingly, one childhood predictor of offending, poor\nparental supervision, also predicted cardiovascular disorders.\nMost interestingly perhaps, convictions still had an overall\nsignificant negative relation with illness at age 32. With regard\nto mental health outcomes, however, this study provides evidence\nof a positive age-related effect of convictions on psychological\ndisorders after age 18, in the 2 years prior to which no significant\nassociations between offending and psychological disorders\nwere found.\nThis longitudinal study allows causal inferences to be drawn,\nparticularly since the direction of effect was consistently from\nconvictions to later psychological disorder. In this context,\noffender treatment programmes are necessary not just to treat\nestablished psychological problems arising out of substance\nmisuse for example, but also the mental health problems which\nappear to be complications either of convictions (proof of guilt)\nor of criminal justice sentences (`remedies') for offending, or a\ncombination of both. The link found in this study between\nassault injury and sleep disruption may reflect chronic post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, anxiety or depression.6,7\nOn the basis of these findings, the principal health impacts of\nan antisocial lifestyle occur most frequently, not surprisingly,\nwhen antisocial behaviour is at its most frequent. Adverse\nimpacts are of two types: short-term impacts \u00ad such as most\ninjuries, and longer term impacts, such as psychological\ndisorders and alcohol or other drug dependence. There are\nother long-term impacts, not assessed here, which include those\nassociated with teenage pregnancy. This cohort of men reached\nthe age of 25 (in 1978) before HIV infection became a significant\nrisk. The results of this study are consistent with the association\nbetween antisocial behaviour and the constellation of impacts\non health comprising DATES syndrome (Drug Abuse, Assault,\nTrauma and Elective Surgery).8 From a prevention standpoint,\nthe obvious implication of this is to limit the chances of long-\nterm effects like dependence, and, in view of the links between\nconvictions and psychological disorders, chronic involvement\nwith the criminal justice system. Reductions in convictions seem\nlikely to have substantial benefits for mental health, particularly\nafter the age of 20. Given links between convictions and psycho-\nlogical disorders, future research should seek to compare the\nimpact of traditional criminal justice and of alternative criminal\njustice `remedies' such as restorative justice on the mental health\nof offenders.\nWhere risk taking is at its most prevalent, situational preven-\ntion and targeted policing is most effective.9 One implication of\nthese findings is that prevention of offending and of childhood\nprecursors of offending, for example, by pre-school education\nand early family support, is likely to improve health mainly by\npreventing injury and drug misuse in early adulthood and also\nby preventing psychological disorders and skin disease in sub-\nsequent decades. Another implication is that because an anti-\nsocial lifestyle is associated with comparatively low rates of illness\nat least up to age 32, research and health promotion effort should\nbe invested in trying to identify underlying protective factors,\nevents and mechanisms, whilst reducing opportunities and pro-\npensity to offend. Since alcohol may be at the root of both\nhealth protective effects and injury, alcohol harm reduction is\nan important priority.10 In this context, making sure that treat-\nment for injury includes management of alcohol misuse, for\nexample, by combining wound care for young males with brief\nalcohol interventions may be particularly cost effective.11\nAt present, the prevention of offending and the prevention of\ninjury and illness are considered and organized separately. The\nfindings of this study, including positive associations between\nrisk taking and health, suggest that a more integrated approach\nto prevention \u00ad in which offender rehabilitation and public health\npractitioners collaborate \u00ad would pay substantial dividends.\nReferences\n1 Shepherd JP, Farrington DP, Potts AJC.
