They then hugged and burst into laughter. `I looked into his eyes and\nsaw a reflection of myself . . . I wanted to scream or cry, but all I could do\nwas laugh.' \" (Jim Springer, New York Times Magazine, December 9,\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nThe psychological literature includes numerous reports demonstrating greater\ncooperation and affiliation between monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ)\ntwins (Segal, 2000). These studies represent diverse viewpoints, methods and\npopulations so convergence among the findings is compelling. Extant research\ncan be organized into four theoretical perspectives: psychoanalytic/\npsychodynamic, behavioral-genetic, social-genetic and evolutionary\npsychological. These separate perspectives generate similar and/or related\nhypotheses.\nPsychoanalytic and Psychodynamic Theories\nPsychoanalytic and psychodynamic approaches highlight the unique effects of\nshared development with a physically identical sibling. Perceptions of\nresemblance by twins and similar treatment by others are held responsible for\nblurring co-twins' individuality and sense of self (Siemon and Adelman 1986).\nPsychoanalysts have also recognized a \"twinning reaction\" consisting of \"mutual\nidentification and part fusion of object and self-representation, leading to a\nThis perspective would predict a positive association between physical\nresemblance and social closeness.\nThese themes are well illustrated in Engel's (1975) moving account of the loss\nof his MZ twin brother. In a moving address marking the tenth anniversary of his\nMZ co-twin's death, psychiatrist George Engel (1975) recalled childhood\nnicknames (both were \"oth\" \u00ad- short for other) and confusion between events\naffecting himself and his twin.\nEfforts in this area have been almost exclusively case reports and\ncommentaries. A recurrent difficulty with these approaches is nearly exclusive\nfocus on look-alike (presumably MZ) pairs, with lack of reference to the crucial\ndistinction between twin types. The presumption that look-alike twins are\nnecessarily MZ is also misconceived, given the physical variability among DZ\nBehavioral-Genetic Theory\nBehavioral-genetic research assesses relative genetic and environmental\ncontributions to trait variation. Co-twin similarities in behavior would be expected\nto contribute to twin pair assessment and satisfaction with the twin relationship.\nMZ twins have shown greater agreement in twinship satisfaction than DZ twins,\nalthough mean ratings in some experiential features (e.g., fighting frequency)\nhave not always differed (Loehlin and Nichols 1976). Subsequent findings\nsupport both greater \"positivity\" and reduced \"negativity\" between MZ twins,\nrelative to other siblings (Reiss, Neiderhiser, Hetherington and Plomin, 2000). A\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nmore recent study found similar levels of intimacy between MZ and DZ twins, but\ngreater likelihood of MZ twins naming each other as best friends (Foy, Vernon\nBehavioral genetics emphasizes reactive gene-environment correlation, the\nconcept that individuals respond to, rather than create, co-twins' separate and joint\nbehaviors. Behavioral genetics does not, however, sample the full range of\nexplanatory domains, leaving some questions (e.g., how social circumstances\nmodify genetic effects on social relationships) unanswered.\nSocial-Genetic Theory\nSocial genetics, a subdiscipline of behavioral genetics, addresses the proximal\neffects of genes on social behavior and organization (Hahn 1990, Scott 1997). It\nacknowledges that genotypic effects differentially influence individual and joint\nbehaviors, underlining the contribution of interactants' genetic backgrounds to\nsocial acts and consequences (Hahn 1990). Genetically homogeneous partners\n(MZ twins) would be expected to show greater cooperation in problem-solving\ntasks, relative to genetically heterogeneous partners (DZ twins).\nExemplary of this approach is Von Bracken's (1934) early experiment,\ncomparing the behaviors of MZ and DZ twin children working apart and in close\nproximity. MZ twins performed more alike when working together than apart.\nAmong pairs showing the greatest differences when apart, the more skillful twin\nallowed the co-twin to catch up when together. In contrast, DZ twins were more\nindividually motivated. Partners perceiving ability differences were unmotivated\nin the presence of their co-twin, given that a cutting edge for competition was\nlacking. However, partners perceiving matched abilities competed intensely.\ncooperation during joint puzzle completion even though all twins were\nindividually competent. Finally, a new study of older twins demonstrated higher\nlevels of intimacy, attachment security and support within MZ than DZ twin pairs\n(Neyer, 2002). In that study, MZ twins' attachment security and relationship\nsatisfaction were unrelated to contact frequency, while the reverse was true for\nDZ twins.\nSocial genetics builds natural bridges between behavioral genetics and\nevolutionary psychology. So far, few studies have proceeded with this view in\nmind.\nEvolutionary Psychology\nEvolutionary psychology aims to identify psychological and physical attributes\npromoting survival and reproduction during the course of human history. In\nseminal papers, Hamilton (1964a,b) described a theoretical basis for the evolution\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nof altruism: Natural selection favors alleles predisposing individuals to behave in\nways promoting the transmission of those alleles into later generations. Alleles\ninfluencing individuals to favor others likely to carry replicas of those alleles is an\nindirect means by which genes achieve future representation (i.e., inclusive\nfitness). The frequency with which one is predisposed to direct benefits to others\nshould, thus, vary as a function of relative genetic relatedness. MZ twins would,\nthus, be expected to show greater within-pair altruism than DZ twins.\nWorking from this perspective, Segal and Hershberger (1999) observed more\nfrequent cooperative trials between MZ than DZ twin adolescents and adults\nduring a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Loh and Elliott (1998) reported greater MZ\nthan DZ twin cooperation on a task with uncertain reward equality. Interestingly,\nthe reverse proved true when reward equality was certain, suggesting that\ninconsistent dominance relations between some MZ co-twins allows competition\nin settings promising matched outcomes to partners.\nEvolutionary psychology offers a theoretical framework capable of unifying\nother behavioral-genetic methods into this approach can facilitate tests of novel\nhypotheses and ameliorate concerns over inattention to behavioral variation\nwithin species.\nTwins Raised Apart\nTwin studies of social relatedness have been limited to twins raised together.\nDespite numerous publications on reared apart twins, spanning 75 years (Popenoe\nKaprio, Koskenvuo, Juntunen, and Kesanieme 1998), twin relationships in\nreunited pairs have never been assessed systematically. These rare pairs offer a\nunique model for exploring genetic and environmental underpinnings of social\nrelatedness, at both proximate and ultimate explanatory levels.\nEarly reared apart twin studies and reports (Popenoe 1922: 1 MZA pair;\npairs Juel-Nielsen; 1966: 12 MZA pairs) appended biographical details to the\nquantitative findings. This material is illuminating, but limited. First, DZA twin\npairs were not recruited, thus precluding comparative evaluation by zygosity.\nSecond, the quality of available information varies across cases and studies.\nDespite these caveats, this work has yielded some theoretically provocative\ntrends. It appears that 40 of the 76 pairs showed close social relations as\nevidenced by frequent contact following reunion, satisfaction with the\nrelationship, investigator's comments and other indicators. In contrast, 14 pairs\ndid not display warm relations. The remaining 22 pairs were difficult to judge\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nbecause of \"mixed\" characterizations and/or because contact was controlled by\nyoung twins' adoptive families. In summary, nearly three-fourths of the pairs for\nwhom information was unequivocal (40/54) developed close social relationships\nsoon after meeting.\nThe rapport displayed by these previously studied MZA twins challenges the\nview that shared time is requisite to developing close social attachments and\nsimilar interests. Perspectives acknowledging the contribution of twins' relative\ngenetic relatedness to their social relations would seem necessary. Mechanisms\nunderlying social closeness and affiliation are examined below.\nSocial Relatedness Mechanisms\nSimilarity as a basis for attraction and liking is supported by numerous\npsychological observations. Similarities include physical, behavioral and\nsituational features. Keller, Thiessen and Young (1996) showed that both dating\nand married couples assort positively for physical traits (e.g., age and bodily\nattractiveness) and behavioral traits (e.g., humor and imaginativeness). Married\ncouples, however, showed greater assortment for behavioral traits, suggesting that\npsychological similarity contributes more importantly to relationship duration.\nThe assortative mating literature does, in fact, include many studies showing\nvarious degrees of positive spousal assortment across measured traits (Plomin,\nDeFries, McClearn, and McGuffin 2001). Consistent with these findings are\nstudies linking personality and attitudinal similarities (and perceptions of these\nsimilarities) with friendship attraction across age groups (Rosenblatt and\nLynch, Coplan, Rose-Krasnor and Booth 1994). Rowe, Woulbroun and Gulley\n(1994) emphasized that friends' behavioral similarities are present prior to\nrelationship formation.\nIn their classic work, Tiger and Fox (1971) asserted that members of groups\nare held together by symbolic processes; thus, one responds to person categories\nby virtue of common unifying features. Examples include the communality and\nsupport of kibbutz children (Bettelheim 1969) and bereaved relatives (Lieberman\nCultural conceptions of twins affect beliefs about their roles and relationships\ntwinship with expectations of behavioral and physical similarities, not differences\n(Stewart 2000). Stereotypes of twins convey the idea of extraordinary emotional\ncloseness and intimacy between co-twins, especially those who are same-sex.\nThese beliefs are a likely reflection of the phenotypic similarities shown by most\ngenetically identical twins. Many people are, however, insensitive to the varieties\nof twinning, so apply this view equally to MZ and DZ pairs. In fact, it has been\nargued that \"the social label `twin,' for both types of twins, is more valid or\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nconsequential than the label monozygotic twin or dizygotic twin\" (Stewart\n2000:729). Of course, not all twins and their families conform to these views\neither in belief or behavior.\nSome evolutionary researchers have considered mechanisms shaping the\ninfrastructure of our social relations. At the proximal level, attraction may be\nfacilitated by phenotypic matching, a mechanism proposed to foster recognition of\nclose kin. Specifically, information is learned about one's own phenotypic\ncharacteristics and those of relatives. The outcome of this learning process is an\n\"image,\" \"template\" (Sherman and Holmes 1985) or \"learned standard of\nappearance\" (Trivers 1985) against which to assess the phenotype of an\nunfamiliar individual. (Accurate identification of individuals would be requisite to\ndirecting altruism toward genetically related recipients, as prescribed by\nHamilton. It also lends meaning to the social-psychological view that \"similarities\nattract.\") The nature of proximal mechanisms facilitating attraction between\nfamily members does, however, warrant elaboration. A recent study demonstrated\nthat emotional closeness partially mediates the effect of genetic relatedness on\nwillingness to behave altruistically (Korchmoros and Kenny 2001).\nIt is possible that MZ and DZ twins' behavioral and/or physical similarities\n(and dissimilarities) and their perceptions of these features underlie emotional and\ncognitive processes affecting social bonding between them. This view concurs\nwith the proposal (based on MZ twins' close attachment) that \"Recognition of this\nsense [of 'we'] triggers a series of emotions whose net effect is tribal unity and the\nincreased chance for altruism\" (Freedman, 1979:129). Such reasoning lends fresh\ndimensions to psychodynamic explanations which see causal connections between\ntwins' physical identity, treatment by others and close attachment.\nThe Present Study\nThe present study compared subjective social closeness in MZA and DZA twin\npairs. It also compared twins' feelings of familiarity, defined as \"how well you\nthink you know this person.\" The social relationship literature draws a distinction\nbetween subjective closeness (perceptions of relationship quality) and behavioral\ncloseness (degree and variety of interaction) (Aron, Aron and Smollan 1992). The\nformer conceptualization was the focus of the present work.\nHypotheses were generated by evolutionary theorizing, although expected\nfindings would support the range of theoretical perspectives presented above. The\nfirst hypothesis was that MZA twins would experience greater social closeness\nand familiarity than DZA twins. Second, it was expected that degree of contact\nprior to assessment would not be associated with social relatedness. Third, it was\nanticipated that twins' perceptions of their physical similarity would correlate\npositively with the nature of their social relations. Fourth, it was expected that\nreunited twins would feel socially closer and more familiar to one another than to\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nthe unrelated siblings with whom they were raised. Associations between social\nrelations and personality traits, interests, values and education were also of\ninterest.\nMethod\nSample and Procedures\nTwins were participants in the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart\n(MISTRA). The MISTRA is a longitudinal study of twins separated at birth,\nreared in separate homes and reunited as adults. This project was launched in\n1979 in the Psychology Department at the University of Minnesota (Bouchard, et\nal. 1990). The majority of twins came from the United States and Great Britain,\nwhile some came from Australia, Canada, China, New Zealand, Sweden, the\nNetherlands and Germany. Twins were identified by referrals from colleagues, the\nmedia, reunion registries and other sources. Participants were invited to the\nUniversity of Minnesota where they completed approximately fifty hours of\npsychological and medical testing. A detailed description of the assessment\nThe final sample consisted of 44 MZA twin pairs, 33 DZA twin pairs and 7\nindividual twins and triplets. Two sets of triplets were entered as three pairs each.\nmonths (sd = 12.64). DZA twins were separated significantly later than MZA\nexceeded MZA twins on this measure, a difference that approached statistical\nsignificance [t (75) = -1.76, p< .08]. It is likely that DZA twins' differing\nappearance extended their time until reunion because they were unlikely to be\nmistaken for one another. (The natural DZ twinning rate is approximately twice as\nhigh as the MZ twinning rate in western societies; see Bulmer [1970]. However,\nmost DZA twins' meetings were facilitated by personal searches and/or\nprofessional assistance. In contrast, a number of MZA twin pairs were reunited\nbecause they were mistaken for one another by others.) Additional descriptive\ncharacteristics of the twins are summarized in Tables 1a and 1b.\nThis study presents mostly pair analyses, although some individual analyses\nare included. (Some inflation of p-values in individual analyses may occur due to\nlack of independence from paired observations.) Sample sizes vary across\nanalyses depending upon availability of data. Adjustment was also made in\nindividual analyses for triplets included in multiple pairings.\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nTable 1a.

Based on these results, plus comparison of\nanthropometric measures (fingerprint ridgecount, ponderal index and cephalic\nindex), the probability of misclassifying a DZ pair as MZ is less than .001\n(Lykken 1978). Serological findings were unavailable for several weeks so, with\nthe exception of opposite-sex twins (whose sex difference classified them as DZ),\nparticipants did not know their twin type with certainty during the study.\nA Twin Relationship Survey (TRS) was introduced into the standard\nassessment schedule in 1983. TRSs were completed independently by each twin\nwith the assistance of a trained examiner. Several twins completed the survey by\nmail, a procedure that was possible given that each section contained clear\ninstructions. Questions concerned the circumstances of separation, the nature of\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nthe adoption experience, events surrounding the search for the twin, impressions\nof physical resemblance, perceptions of social relatedness and reactions to other\ntwinship features. In some cases only one pair member took part in this phase of\nthe study due to scheduling considerations. Given that the TRS was unavailable in\nduring their ten-year follow-up visit.\nThe present study examines twins' perceptions of initial (retrospective) and\ncurrent social closeness and familiarity vis-\u00e0-vis contact time, perceived physical\nresemblance and similarity in measured behavioral traits.\nSocial Relatedness\nTwins recalled their initial impression of social closeness using a six-point\nscale (1 = closer than best friends to 6 = less close than most people I meet for the\nfirst time). Comparable ratings were requested for current closeness, and for\ninitial and current familiarity. (Initial ratings were retrospective and referred to\nthe first meeting in adulthood. Current ratings reflected twins' present feelings at\nthe time of participation in the study.) Twins also provided current social\ncloseness and familiarity ratings for the unrelated siblings with whom they were\nraised, furnishing an informative comparison group. If ratings were available for\nmore than one adoptive brother (and/or sister) the brother (and/or sister) whose\nscore(s) reflected the highest levels of closeness and familiarity were chosen. This\nwas done to set up a more stringent test of differences between ratings for co-\ntwins and unrelated siblings.\nThe two current measures showed significant relationships with frequency of\nthinking about the twin (current closeness, .52, p< .01; current familiarity, .38, p<\nappear to be tapping the positive nature of the relationship.\nContact Time\nTwins' contact time measures included days before separation, separation to\nfirst contact (years), reunion to assessment (months), total contact time (weeks),\ntotal time apart (cumulative time together, in months, from birth to assessment)\nand percent of lifetime apart (total time apart/age in months). These data were\nobtained separately from both twins during the life history interview on the first\nassessment day. This information was important to obtain given some critics'\nclaims that reared apart twins' similarities are explained by length of contact,\nstatus of rearing family (biological or adoptive) and other life events. (See\nBouchard, 1993 for a discussion and refutation of these allegations.)\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nPhysical Resemblance\nTwins judged their physical resemblance using a six-point scale (1 = as alike\nas two copies of the same person to 6 = not at all similar; no more alike than any\ntwo people of the same age and sex). This question referred to the current time\nframe. This item was highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .92) with reference to a\nsecond physical similarity measure (perceived physical resemblance if weight\nand/or hair style were the same), rated on the same six-point scale. Its validity is\ndemonstrated by its significant correlation with zygosity (r = .67, p< .01, n = 157).\nPersonality\nThe Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) was routinely\nadministered to all participants. MPQ scales represent eleven personality\ndimensions (e.g., well-bring, stress reaction) and three higher order factors\n(positive emotionality, negative emotionality and constraint) (Tellegen 1982,\nconsistency reliabilities (Cronbach's alpha) range from .76- .89. Validity scales\nidentify questionable records (Tellegen, Lykken, Bouchard, Wilcox, Segal and\nInterests\nThe Strong Vocational Interest Blank-Campbell Interest Inventory (SVIB-\nSCII; Hansen and Campbell 1985) was administered to all participants. It is\norganized into sections assessing preferences (like \u00ad indifferent - dislike) for\noccupations, school subjects and activities, as well as preferences for one of two\nactivities. A final section assesses personality characteristics. Responses yield\nscores for scales representing General Occupational Themes (6 scales), Basic\nInterests (23 scales) and Occupations (207 scales). Two week test-retest\nreliabilities exceed .90. The predictive and concurrent validities of the scales have\nbeen well documented and are available in the 1985 manual (Hansen and\nCampbell 1985). Twins reared apart data have yielded mean heritabilities of .35\nand .37 for the General Occupational Themes (e.g., Artistic, Social) and Basic\nInterest scales (e.g., Nature, Mechanical), respectively (Moloney, Bouchard and\nSegal 1991). (Only occupational themes and interests were investigated in the\npresent study.) Somewhat higher heritabilities were found in a subsequent study\ncombining twins reared apart and together, using alternative measures (Lykken,\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nValues\nThe Allport-Vernon-Lindzey (AVL) Study of Values (Allport, Vernon and\nLinzey 1960) measures six values (Religious, Social, Economic, Political,\nAesthetic and Theoretical). Scoring is ipsative such that scores on one dimension\nare influenced by scores on another dimension. Split-half reliabilities range from\n.84 - .85, and one month test-retest reliabilities range from .77 - .92. The validity\nof the AVL is demonstrated by numerous studies which have examined scores of\ngroups with known characteristics (Allport, Vernon and Lindzey 1970).\nEducational Background\nLife history information generated scores for years of higher education and the\nHollingshead Educational code. The Hollingshead Educational code indicates\nlevel of education completed, ranging from 1 (less than seventh grade) to 7\n(graduate degree) (Hollingshead 1975). Individuals still in school were excluded\nfrom these analyses.\nResults\nAssociations Between Social Relatedness Measures and Other Variables\n1. Social Closeness and Familiarity\nThe four social relatedness measures (initial and current closeness; initial and\nnegligible or slight correlations with the six contact time measures (-.16 to .21, n\n= 133 - 161). Two correlations deserve comment. First, the relationship between\ndays before separation and current familiarity, while significant (r = .16, p< .05, n\n= 161), was in a counterintuitive direction. (This correlation suggested that longer\ntime together predicted reduced familiarity.) However, elimination of several\noutlying cases yielded a smaller, non-significant correlation (r = .10, ns, n = 154).\nSecond, the correlation between time from reunion to assessment and current\ncloseness (r = .21, p< .05, n = 150) suggested that twins studied soon after\nmeeting were socially closer than those studied later. However, many factors\naffected scheduling (e.g., twins' work responsibilities; twins' distance from\nMinneapolis), thus tempering this finding.\nMean ratings of initial closeness, current closeness and initial familiarity did\nnot differ between DZA same-sex and opposite-sex twins. The difference in\ncurrent familiarity approached, but did not achieve, statistical significance. These\ntwo twin groups were, therefore, combined in subsequent analyses.\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\n2. Social Relatedness and Physical Resemblance\nTwins' current perception of physical similarity correlated significantly with\np< .01, n = 157) for the combined sample. Age and sex were unrelated to\nperceptions of physical resemblance.\nRecall that physical similarity correlated significantly with zygosity (r = . 67,\np< .01, n = 157), such that MZA twins judged themselves to look more alike than\ndid DZA twins. This was expected, given the causal relationship between genetic\nfactors and physical development. Assigning this variable as a covariate in\nsubsequent analyses would have violated the assumption of independence\nbetween the covariate and independent measure and removed meaningful\nvariance. It was, nevertheless, interesting to examine physical similarity-social\nrelatedness correlations within zygosity groups. (Separate correlations did not\ndiffer for DZA same-sex and opposite-sex twins. DZA opposite-sex twins' mean\nphysical similarity rating was somewhat below that of the DZA same-sex twins,\nas expected.) Correlations between physical similarity and current closeness were\nstatistically significant for both MZA (r = .33, p< .01, n = 89) and DZA twins (r =\n.29, p< .05, n = 68), and did not differ between twin groups. The correlation\nbetween physical similarity and current familiarity was statistically significant for\ndifference that was statistically significant (z = 2.044, p< .05).\nMZA vs. DZA Twin Pairs\nTwin Group Differences in Mean Ratings\nA repeated measures analysis of variance compared MZA-DZA twin\ndifferences in initial and current closeness and familiarity. The design included\none between-subjects measure (Zygosity: MZA, DZA) and two within-subjects\nmeasures (Feeling: closeness, familiarity and Time: initial, current). The\nassumption of homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices was satisfied. Given\nthat twin data are not independent, the analysis used mean social relatedness\nratings for each pair (see Kenny and Judd, 1986); data from individual twins\n(twins whose co-twins did not complete the TRS) were retained. The between-\nsubjects effect of zygosity was statistically significant [F (1, 80) = 6.26, p< .01,\n2 = .07] and, as expected, MZA twins expressed greater overall closeness and\nfamiliarity than DZA twins. Significant within-subject effects were observed for\n2= .06]. Specifically, twins experienced greater closeness than familiarity toward\ntheir co-twin, and current ratings generally exceeded initial ratings. A significant\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nfamiliarity across time, but little change in closeness. None of the interactions\ninvolving zygosity were significant. Mean ratings for MZA and DZA twins are\ndisplayed in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Of course, DZA twins are\ngenetically equivalent to full siblings so some would be expected to feel quite\nclose and familiar after meeting. However, if reared apart twins' social\nrelationships mirror those of reared together twins, then higher proportions of\nMZA than DZA twins should endorse the highest choice levels. Few pairs of\neither zygosity were expected to endorse the lowest levels of social relatedness\n(e.g., \"less close than most people I meet for the first time\"; \"less familiar than\nmost people I meet for the first time\"). Frequency tables revealed reduced\nnumbers of subjects in the lowest choice categories, so the data were recast into\nfour 2 x 3 contingency tables: zygosity by three response categories (choice 1:\ncloser/more familiar than best friends; choice 2: as close/as familiar as best\nfriends; choices 3 \u00ad 6: less close/less familiar than best friends). These data are\ndisplayed graphically in Figures 1a \u00ad 1d.\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nThere are several interesting features to these findings.

The mean age difference between\ntwins and their adoptive brothers was 6.41 years (sd = 5.04) and ranged from 1 to\n22 years. The mean age difference between twins and their adoptive sisters was\nuncorrelated with closeness and similarity ratings for twins' adoptive siblings.\nCurrent social relatedness ratings were used to achieve twin-sibling\ncomparability. Mean sibling scores were used if twins provided ratings for both\nan adoptive brother and an adoptive sister. In addition, in order to circumvent bias\nintroduced from linked observations, twin pair means were used when data were\nprovided by both pair members; this reduced the sample size from 61 to 41. Only\nparticipants with complete data records were included.\nThe analysis was a repeated measures design with two within-subject factors:\nRelative (twin and sibling) and Feeling (closeness and familiarity). All tests of\nwithin-subject effects were statistically significant or approached significance:\nstronger for co-twins than for adoptive siblings, and feelings of familiarity\nexceeded feelings of closeness. Twins rated co-twin closeness and co-twin\nfamiliarity equally, but they rated adoptive sibling familiarity higher than\nadoptive sibling closeness. Mean ratings are presented in Table 3.\nTable 3.

Significant chi square values\nshowed greater concentrations of \"high level\" co-twin ratings and \"low level\"\ndisplayed in Figures 2a and 2b.\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nPersonality, Interests, Values and Education\nPrior to analysis, scale scores for personality traits, interests and values were\nage- and sex-corrected according to the methods of McGue and Bouchard (1984).\nAge corresponded to the time at which these psychological traits were assessed;\nthus, questionnaires for some twins were administered up to ten years earlier than\nthe TRS. (In other words, those twins completing the TRS during the follow-up\nvisit had completed personality and interest forms during the initial visit.) The\nage-sex adjustment procedure utilized information from 443 individuals including\nreared apart twins and their significant others (e.g., spouses, partners, adoptive\nsiblings and children) who accompanied them to Minnesota. Mean score\nsubstitution was used to accommodate missing data.\nThe absolute co-twin difference in each scale was correlated with both the (1)\nabsolute co-twin difference and (2) twin pair mean on each social relatedness\nmeasure. These correlations provide different information. For example, the first\ncorrelation shows whether a small difference in a personality trait (e.g., social\npotency) is associated with a small difference in social relatedness (e.g., current\ncloseness). However, co-twins with a small personality difference might show a\nsmall closeness difference at either end of that scale. The second correlation\nsupplements the first by revealing whether a small difference in personality is\nassociated with greater mean pair closeness. In the context of the present study,\npairs of correlations were considered meaningful if both types were statistically\nsignificant. Given the large number of correlations calculated, the significance\nlevel was set to .001 to contain type I error.\nPersonality\nMean correlations between the social relatedness measures and eleven\npersonality traits were quite modest, ranging from -.01 to .23 for MZA twins and\nfrom -.03 to .19 for DZA twins. The only statistically significant findings were the\nDZA twin correlations between co-twin difference in aggression and twin pair\nmean in initial closeness (r = .57), and co-twin difference in absorption and co-\ntwin difference in current familiarity (r = .71). Thus, small co-twin differences in\naggression were associated with early impressions of increased social closeness,\nand co-twin differences in absorption were associated with co-twin differences in\ncurrent familiarity. However, the corresponding correlations were not statistically\nsignificant.\nOccupations and Interests\nMean correlations across the six occupational themes were small, ranging from\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nco-twin difference in Artistic occupations correlated significantly with mean pair\ncurrent familiarity (r = .52), but the corresponding correlation was non-\nsignificant. None of the DZA twin correlations were statistically significant.\nMean correlations across the twenty-three basic interests ranged from -.00 to\n.18 for MZA twins and from .12 to .18 for DZA twins. For MZA twins, the co-\ntwin difference in science interest correlated significantly with mean pair initial\nfamiliarity (r = .58). For DZA twins, correlations were statistically significant\nbetween the co-twin difference in Domestic Arts and co-twin difference in current\ncloseness (r = .53), and between the co-twin difference in Nature and the co-twin\ndifference in initial closeness (r = .64). However, corresponding correlations were\nnot significant.\nValues\nMean correlations across the six values ranged from -.04 to .15 for MZA twins\nand -.02 to .12 for DZA twins. None of the correlations reached statistical\nsignificance.\nEducational Background\nFor MZA twins, both correlations involving the Hollingshead Educational\nCode and initial familiarity were statistically significant. A smaller co-twin\ndifference in education was associated with a smaller co-twin difference in initial\nfamiliarity (r = .49), and with increased mean pair initial familiarity (r = .58).\nNone of the DZA twin correlations reached statistical significance.\nDiscussion\nThis study was the first to systematically explore associations between genetic\nand social relatedness in twins reared apart. Adoptive siblings of the reared apart\ntwins furnished a unique comparison group.\nTwin Group and Sibling Differences\nAs expected, greater closeness and familiarity between MZA co-twins than\nDZA co-twins was demonstrated. Also, as expected, MZA and DZA twins'\nratings were most sharply differentiated at the highest levels of social relatedness.\nInitial experiences of closeness and familiarity reached/achieved statistical\nsignificance, while current experiences did not. These findings place the well-\nknown \"twin bond phenomenon\" in a scientific context. Specifically, the greater\nsocial attraction initially experienced by MZA twins suggests that correlates of\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\ngenetic identity confer special understandings between these twins, despite\nmeeting for the first time as adults. This interpretation receives some support from\nthe fact that DZA twins' current closeness ratings were somewhat below MZA\ntwins' initial closeness ratings. A purely cultural explanation (i.e., society expects\ntwins to be close so they act accordingly) appears unwarranted, given the twin\ngroup differences that emerged.\nThe finding that closeness ratings exceeded familiarity ratings for twins overall\nis not surprising. The twins were living apart all their lives so the newly found co-\ntwin, while triggering feelings of closeness, may have still seemed somewhat\nnovel or unfamiliar. Feelings of familiarity did, understandably, increase over\ntime for both MZA and DZA twins as they grew better acquainted.\nTwins' closeness and familiarity ratings for their adoptive siblings furnished an\nimportant backdrop against which to assess their ratings for their co-twins. The\nhigher ratings for twins than siblings demonstrate that (1) shared time is not\nmandatory for developing close social relations and (2) genetic relatedness affects\nsocial relationships. The concentrations of co-twin ratings at the high ends of the\nsocial relatedness scales, and adoptive sibling ratings at the low ends, underline\nthe differential social significance of these relatives to reared apart twins. Higher\nfamiliarity than closeness ratings for adoptive siblings are not surprising because\nthe twins and their adoptive siblings were raised together since infancy and\nchildhood.\nTwins' perceptions of their physical resemblance correlated significantly with\ntheir feelings of current closeness and familiarity. This finding does not imply a\ncausal association, partly because of the confounding of MZA twins' physical and\nbehavioral similarities. Disentangling these effects would require organizing\nMZA twins according to various combinations of physical and personality\nsimilarity. Note that physical resemblance correlated significantly with closeness\nfor both zygosity groups, but with familiarity for MZA twins only. Perhaps some\nMZA twins accentuate slight physical differences, leading to feelings of reduced\nfamiliarity, relative to more \"look-alike\" twins. Current familiarity between some\nDZA co-twins may rely more importantly on degree of resemblance in other\nphenotypic traits. Unfortunately, twins' perceptions of their physical similarity to\ntheir co-twin at the time of meeting (and to their adoptive siblings) were\nunavailable.\nThe present findings are, thus, consistent with Hamilton's inclusive fitness\ntheory which views altruistic acts toward close genetic relatives as a way of\nfacilitating transmission of genes into future generations. An evolutionary\npsychological interpretation does not deny contributions from other theoretical\nperspectives. Instead, it both invigorates and gains from these views. For\nexample, evolutionary psychology refines psychodynamic understanding of how\ntreatment by others may affect social relations. Other peoples' responses to twins'\nbehaviors may reflect or reinforce (but not create) their affiliative feelings.\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nConversely, psychodynamic theories offer rich descriptive material to which\nevolutionary researchers may turn for proximal mechanisms underlying social\nrelatedness.\nFew meaningful associations emerged between twins' social relatedness\nmeasures and similarities in personality, interests, values and education. The only\nexception was the pair of significant MZA twin correlations between the\nHollingshead educational code and initial familiarity. Of course, twins do not\nrespond to their co-twins' educational background per se, but most likely to the\nideas, activities and motivations underlying their educational experiences. A\ncloser look at factors driving these MZA correlations, and the absence of these\nrelationships among DZA twins, would be worth pursuing.\nDespite the absence of clear findings, it may be premature to conclude that\ntwins' similarities in personality, interests and values are irrelevant to social\nrelatedness. It is possible that the MPQ scales are insensitive to facets of\npersonality and temperament that meaningfully shape relations between reunited\nrelatives. It is also possible that alternative instruments, as well as twins' own\nperceptions of their similarities in general intelligence, special abilities,\npersonality traits, values and interests would provide a more comprehensive\nassortment of measures for assessing the bases of social relatedness. Leek and\nSmith (1991) found that relatives' perceived personality similarity correlated with\nvarious help and conflict measures. Twins' evolving relations may have also\nrested partly on interpersonal factors not measured in the present study.\nAttributes such as \"trust,\" \"openness\" and \"spontaneity\" are valued in twin\nrelationships (Foy, Vernon and Jang 2001) so may modify closeness and\nfamiliarity.\nThe present study is not without limitations. Twins' closeness and familiarity\nwere assessed using four single-item measures. Future studies will, hopefully,\ncorroborate these findings via multi-item scales and diverse methods. However,\none- and two-item measures (e.g., Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale [IOS] and\nSocial Closeness Scale [SCL]) have proven valid in studies on the nature and\nstructure of social closeness (see Aron, Aron, and Smollan1992; Aron and Fraley\n1999). Both these measures assess relatedness on a 1 to 7 scale, similar to items\nused in the present study, although the IOS uses a pictorial format.\nMore detailed assessment of the nature of twins' contact time prior to\nassessment (e.g., type of activities; presence of others) could augment the present\nfindings. For example, time from reunion to assessment was significantly longer\nfor MZA than DZA twins, raising the possibility that MZA twins used that\nopportunity to interact. However, shorter time from reunion to assessment was\nassociated with increased current closeness. It is, therefore, plausible that socially\ncloser twins were more eager participants than those who felt less close. This\nrelationship remained significant for MZA twins (r = .35, n = 83), but not for\nDZA twins (r = -.02, n = 67). However, as indicated above, scheduling was\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\naffected by many factors so this association should be viewed cautiously. It is also\npossible that closeness may be experienced even without frequent and varied\ncontact. Aron and Fraley (1999) found that degree of self-other overlap was\nassociated with subjective feelings of closeness, but not with behavioral\ninteraction.\nIt might be objected that even though zygosity assignments were unavailable\nduring participation, twins' impressions of their twin type (based on physical\nresemblance and/or other indicators) may have biased their subjective relationship\nexperience. This possibility cannot be fully discounted, but seems unlikely. First,\ncultural conceptions of twinship do not draw sharp distinctions between twin\ntypes (Stewart 2000). Second, twins' treatment by others is generally unrelated to\nco-twin similarity in behavior (LaBuda, Svikis, and Pickens1997; Klump, Holly,\nIacono, McGue, and Willson 2000.) Third, parental treatment of twins is\nassociated with true zygosity, not perceived zygosity (Goodman and Stevenson\n1991). Finally, in the present study, correlations between twinship preference\nwhile searching for the twin (1= hoped to look exactly the same to 4 = did not\ncare how similar or different we looked) and the four social relatedness measures\nConclusions\nThe present study suggests several points. First, twin research methodology is\nuseful for assessing evolutionary-based hypotheses concerning genetic and social\nrelatedness. Second, the greater affiliation between MZA than DZA twins should\nredirect attention to proximal social processes underlying these differences. The\nadditional finding that closeness and familiarity ratings for newly found co-twins\nexceeded those for adoptive siblings is compelling and worth additional study.\nFuture work on the bases of social relations should move in exciting directions\nif integrated with molecular genetic analysis. It will be interesting to determine if,\nand to what extent, associations between perceptions of physical resemblance and\nsocial relatedness may be mediated by degree of genetic overlap. Some early twin\nstudies suggest that this is so. Pakstis, Scarr-Salapatek, Elston and Siervogel\n(1972) reported correlations between DZ twins' absolute number of blood group\ndifferences and physical dissimilarity and activity level. Dumont-Driscoll and\nRose (1983) found that DZ twins sharing more blood groups showed greater\nconfusion over their twin type and received higher similarity ratings from mothers\nthan DZ twins sharing fewer blood groups. Such research, as well as studies\nsuggesting links between specific genes and personality traits (Benjamin, Lin,\nPatterson, et al. 1996), support the feasibility of such efforts.\nIdentifying the processes underlying MZ-DZ twin relationships may enhance\nunderstanding of many complex human social behaviors. We might, for example,\nbetter comprehend why some family members are more closely affiliated than\nMeeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity\nothers, why people grieve more for some relatives than for others, why it is\nimportant for many adoptees to search for biological kin and why it is necessary\nfor many children conceived through sperm donation to locate their fathers.\n"
