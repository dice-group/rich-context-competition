Although the distribution of immigrants in terms of human capital is bimodal, it\nis especially the large group of immigrants with little formal education that raises\nconcerns about the impact of immigration on social inequality. With the children of\nimmigrants currently composing more than 20 % of the U.S. population under age 18,\nthe extent to which this population will inherit the educational characteristics of their\nparents is significant for the immediate and long-term future of ethnic stratification in\nthe United States.\nAlthough the strength of intergenerational educational transmission is well docu-\nrecently, transmission within immigrant families was difficult to assess because of a\nlack of representative, large-scale data identifying the educational attainments of\nimmigrants and their adult children. Instead, researchers relied on aggregate data, using\nnational origin or self-reported ethnicity to link generations by regressing the average\nyears of educational attainment of the children of immigrants on the average years of\neducational attainment of immigrants of the same origins in previous survey years\nEven as individual-level data on immigrants and their children became available, the\nmajority of the literature on second-generation attainment has focused on differences in\nattainment controlling for parental background rather than examining the relationship\nbetween parental and child educational attainment itself (for research from the past five\nThis article provides a first methodological demonstration of potential biases emerg-\ning from both of these common approaches to the study of educational inequality\namong the immigrant second generation. A recent review of European research by\nHeath et al. (2008) suggests that the status transmission processes may differ across\nimmigrant origin groups, and Alba et al. (2011) also pointed to the fact that educational\nattainment of immigrants of different origins are unlikely to be comparable. However,\nneither these scholars nor the studies they reviewed have systematically evaluated the\npotential for bias when the educational attainments of different immigrant groups are\ntreated as commensurate. We expand on these initial warnings, outlining in detail how\nboth of these methods rely on the assumption that educational transmission is uniform\nbetween immigrants of different origins and, when natives are compared, between\nimmigrant and native families as well.\nWe demonstrate that this assumption is not upheld in the U.S. case. The resulting\nbias in estimates of intergenerational transmission and expected years of education is\nsevere. Using the educational attainment of parent\u00adchild dyads, we find the regression\ncoefficient of children's on parents' years of education is, on average, 0.11 but ranges\nfrom close to 0 in some groups to as high as 0.37. This implies a generally weak\nrelationship between parental and child educational attainment within immigrant fam-\nilies.1 In contrast, when aggregating the very same data and using weighted averages of\nnational origin groups, as has been done in prior research, we find much higher\nestimates: an association between foreign-born parents' and their children's education\n1 This has also been shown using individual-level data in Denmark (Nielsen et al. 2003), Sweden\nR.R. Luthra, T. Soehl\nof 0.43. We also show that when parental education enters a model as a control\nvariable, models that assume a homogeneous relationship between parental and child\neducation distort national origin comparisons.\nWe connect these findings to research that suggests significant variation in the link\nbetween parental education and the larger set of variables that shape the educational\nattainment of children: between immigrants and natives on the one hand, and across\nimmigrants from different national origins on the other. We also establish two correlates\nof the strength of educational transmission: parent\u00adchild links are stronger in groups\nwith higher average education, and links are weaker in groups with higher within-group\nvariation. In our conclusions, we discuss the relationship between these correlates and\ncurrent understandings of national origin variation in second-generation attainment.\nVariation in Intergenerational Transmission\nSociologists studying migration have long been interested in intergenerational change\namong immigrants, writing extensively on the earlier \"great wave\" of migration at the\ntheories conceived of assimilation as a group-level process, predicting a sequence of\nimproving group relations with the disappearance of ethnic groups as its endpoint. Even\nGordon's influential treatise on the subject is framed as a corrective to the lack of\n\"research and theoretical attention to the nature and implications of American commu-\nThese approaches were extraordinarily productive, guiding immigration research for\nthe better part of a century, yet they do not clearly delineate between individual- and\ngroup-level processes. Assimilation is seen as a convergence of immigrant groups\ntoward the \"core\" and the disappearance of prejudice and discrimination. At the same\ntime, it encompasses processes that are clearly individual in nature, such as intermar-\nriage, shifts in participation, and identification.\nIt is an achievement of recent revisions of assimilation theory (Alba and Nee 2003;\nPortes and Rumbaut 2001) to clearly delineate these two constitutive aspects of\nintergenerational change. On the one hand, Alba and Nee developed an analytical\nmodel that distinguished individual-level socioeconomic mobility, intermarriage, and\nresidential assimilation (boundary crossing) from collective changes in the salience of\nethnicity for immigrant groups as a whole (boundary blurring or shifting). On the other\nhand, segmented assimilation scholars (Haller et al. 2011; Portes and Rumbaut 2001;\nZhou et al. 2008) have distinguished individual- and group-level processes and dem-\nonstrated how opportunities for socioeconomic advancement for immigrant families are\ncontingent on the characteristics and opportunities available to their ethnic group as a\nwhole: the context of reception. For immigrant groups on the upper end of the\nbifurcated educational distribution, most of whom enjoy positive or neutral societal\nperception and documented legal status, the status transmission process is expected to\nunfold in a pattern similar to that of the native population. However, at the lower end of\nthe educational distribution, group-level boundaries and ethnic resources will play a\ngreater role.\nIn response to these theoretical developments, sociologists have gathered several\nnew metropolitan-level surveys of the children of immigrants. These data, which we\nalso rely on here, enable the analytic distinction between group- and individual-level\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\ncharacteristics in predicting second-generation educational attainment, and more\nrecent studies provide strong evidence for group-level variation in the status\ntransmission process.\nSources of Group-Level Variation in Intergenerational Transmission\nA growing literature now addresses how the relative importance of parents' education\nfor the educational attainment of their children may vary depending on the importance\nof extrafamilial or \"group-level\" factors that co-determine educational attainment--\nprocesses that are often grouped under the labels \"neighborhood,\" \"school,\" and \"peer\"\neffects. Certainly, extrafamilial influences matter for education in natives and immi-\ngrant families alike. Yet, in studies of the educational trajectories of the children of\nimmigrants, additional factors come into play.\nGroup-Level Effects\nOne set of factors pertains to the context of reception. Including variables such as host\nsociety perceptions, discrimination, and (parental) legal status as well as the character-\nistics of the coethnic community, this concept plays an important role in the segmented\nassimilation hypothesis. Migrants from some countries (e.g., Cuba, USSR, Vietnam)\nwere given easy access to citizenship and other privileges that foster upward mobility\n(Portes and Rumbaut 2001). In contrast, other migrant streams are heavily undocu-\nmented, facing not only significant barriers in the labor market and exclusion from a\nnumber of public services but also a \"ceiling\" effect on the educational and occupa-\ntional attainment of the young children who migrate with them (Bean et al. 2011;\nGonzales 2011). For the children of such disadvantaged origin groups, foremost\nMexican Americans, attempts at upward mobility may be flattened into a \"working\nclass\" incorporation, with the children of both higher- and lower-skilled parents failing\nto attain middle class status (Luthra and Waldinger 2013). Societal perceptions also\nvary and, as psychological research points out, may be consequential for academic\nperformance (Steele and Aronson 1995). Some research had argued that positive\nstereotypes of minority group academic performance weaken the link between low\nparental education and low child education (Lee and Zhou 2013), whereas negative\nstereotypes can strengthen it, decreasing mobility (Conchas 2001; Gonzales et al. 2002;\nSocial networks and collective efficacy also play an important role in the larger\nliterature on the effects of local context on educational outcomes (Sampson et al. 1999).\nAlthough important for migrants and nonmigrants alike, these networks are arguably\ntighter for migrants. Examples are extensive ethnic \"shadow schooling\" systems\nZhou and Kim 2006), or the access to elite private coethnic high schools for the\nchildren of Cuban migrants in Miami (Portes and Rumbaut 2001). Another example\nis the enforcement of high attainment as a local norm within immigrant communities\n(Kao and Tienda 1995). Those growing up in an environment where going to college is\nthe norm and professional occupations are seen as a minimum level of achievement,\nsuch as the children of Chinese immigrants in New York, feel a stronger social pressure\nand expectation of high attainment (Kasinitz et al. 2008). Especially for immigrant\nR.R. Luthra, T. Soehl\nparents with low levels of education, ethnic social networks can provide an environ-\nment for their children that will isolate them from negative influences and emphasize\neducational attainment, weakening the link between low parental attainment and low\noffspring attainment found in the general population.\nThese \"group effects\" will operate more or less strongly depending on the spatial\ndispersion of the group and the ethnic resources available in immigrant enclaves\norigin immigrants, who are overwhelmingly working class, are less likely to have\naccess to coethnic social networks that span social classes (Bean and Stevens 2003). By\ncontrast, socioeconomically more diverse national origin groups, such as the Koreans\nand Chinese (Zhou et al. 2008), benefit from cross-class ties. For highly skilled\nimmigrants or those who are less geographically concentrated, such as those from the\nPhilippines (Le Espiritu 2003), ethnic resources may play a smaller role; in such\ngroups, the effect of parental characteristics may be similar in magnitude to the patterns\nfound in native families.\nVariation in the Concept-Indicator Link Across Groups\nIn addition to group-level effects related to the context of reception and characteristics\nof the immigrant ethnic community in the receiving country, the extreme discrepancies\nin educational access and quality across immigrant sending countries provide another\nreason both to expect a weaker relationship between parental and child educational\nattainment among the children of immigrants in the United States compared with\nnatives as well as to expect differences in the strength of this relationship between\nimmigrants of different origins. First, parental education (in years) is a distal measure of\nparental human capital: years of education are not directly passed from parent to child.\nRather, parental education is meant to provide a measurable indicator for the \"knowl-\nedge, skills, health, or values\" (Becker 2008) of parents that are expected to influence\nthe human capital acquisition of children. This in itself is not a problem; social\nscientists frequently have to rely on more or less proximal indicators of underlying\nconcepts. Problems arise, however, when the strength of the link between the indicator\nand the concept of interest differs across groups that are then compared.\nFor instance, in some immigrant-sending countries, access to education is highly\nunequal. For example, poor or rural populations may have access to only the most basic\npublic education, no matter what their intellectual potential. Also, the degree to which\nreturns to education diminish and thus the incentives to invest in education vary\nsubstantially across countries (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos 2004). Even for those\nwho do receive formal education, the substantive content of a year of schooling itself\nlevel--and substantive meaning--of formal education may differ between national\ncontexts. As Feliciano (2005:844) pointed out, \". . . neglecting educational selectivity,\nor relative educational attainment, assumes that a high school degree earned in one\ncontext (say, a country where only 10% of the population has one) has the same\nmeaning as a high school degree earned in another context (say, where 80% of the\npopulation has one).\"\nAlthough these insights are frequently applied to questions of assimilation and cross-\ngroup comparisons, the methodological implications receive scant attention. In the\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\nfollowing sections, we show how variation in intergenerational transmission of educa-\ntional attainment can lead to false conclusions when aggregate-level data are used to\nmake inferences about individual transmission and when parental educational attain-\nment serves as a \"control\" variable for family background characteristics, such as\nparental human capital.\nMethodological Implications of Group-Level Variation in the Transmission\nof Educational Attainment\nAggregate Data and Ecological Fallacy\nEarlier U.S. research on intergenerational transmission in immigrant families, as well as\ncurrent research in some countries with more recent immigrant populations, has relied\non aggregate data to estimate intergenerational transmission coefficients. Lacking data\nthat links parent and child dyads, these studies have instead regressed educational or\nwage averages of the children of immigrants on the average of immigrants of the same\nethnic origins several decades prior. Using this method, a series of highly influential\narticles by Borjas (1993, 1994) demonstrated that links in educational attainment and\nreported wages between first- and second-generation immigrants, and even between\nfirst- and third-generation immigrants, are strong and significant, suggesting strong\nintergenerational transmission. The work by Card and collaborators (2000, 2005), using\nsimilar methods, also found substantial links between immigrant parents and their U.S.-\nraised children. The studies by Card and colleagues especially are widely used as an\nexample for similar work with alternative data sets and other countries (see, for\nAcross a number of countries, studies using aggregate data have consistently found\nmuch higher estimates of transmission than those using comparable micro-/family-level\ndata. At the same time, intergenerational associations are consistently lower in migrant\nthan in nonmigrant families (Aydemir et al. 2013; Bauer and Riphahn 2006; Borjas\n2003).2 Two recent studies, an OECD review of intergenerational mobility studies by\nestimates but did not address the source of the differences.\nIt is possible to infer individual-level processes, such as intergenerational transmis-\nsion, from aggregate-level regressions; however, such inference rests on strong as-\nsumptions. One way of stating the condition for accurate cross-level inference is that\nthe relationship between variables on the individual level is the same across units of\nwould mean that the relationship between foreign-born parental education and\nsecond-generation education does not vary across immigrant origin groups. When only\n2 A table summarizing these studies in more detail is available from the authors upon request.\nR.R. Luthra, T. Soehl\naggregate data are available, this of course cannot be evaluated empirically and has to\nbe assumed.\nAnother way to state the requirement formally is that for an estimate from aggregate\ndata to be equivalent to those from individual-level data, in a (hypothetical) individual-\nlevel model, the mean of the independent variable can provide no additional informa-\ntion on the outcome variable. We illustrate this with a simple bivariate case: regressing\nthe educational attainment y (measured in years) of individuals i in group j on an\nintercept  and the educational standing (in years) of their parents x. Using the notation\nin Eq. (1), the coefficient indicating the effect of the mean education level 2\nmust be\nyij\n\u00bc  \u00fe \nxij\n\u00fe \nxj\n\u00fe ij\nReferring to the review of group-level effects described earlier, it is easy to see how\nthis condition may be violated in models that examine the intergenerational transmis-\nsion in immigrant families. In several ways, we can imagine how the mean level of\nparental education in a group is associated with second-generation outcomes above and\nbeyond parental education.\nFigure 1 illustrates how aggregation can cause bias. The figure uses data from two\ngroups, Mexican- and Chinese-origin respondents, from a recent survey of the children\nof immigrants in Los Angeles. The regression lines based on individual data for both\ngroups (gray for Mexicans, black for Chinese) show a relatively weak relationship\nbetween parental and second-generation education as measured in years. The coeffi-\ncients are 0.13 and 0.14, respectively. Fitting a line for individuals from both groups,\nwe get a slope of 0.24 (dashed line). Aggregating and using group means to fit a\nregression produces a much steeper line, with a slope coefficient of almost 0.6.\nThe Use of Parental Education as a Control Variable\nThe more recent availability of micro-level data on immigrants and their children has\nenabled further study of immigrant\u00adnative and national origin differences in educa-\ntional outcomes as well as the mechanisms underlying these differences. Some of these\nstudies have focused on the \"immigrant effect,\" comparing the children of immigrants\nto children of natives of the same (pan)ethnicity and generally documenting better\noutcomes among the foreign-born and children of the foreign-born (Harris et al. 2008;\nThomas 2009; Xie and Greenman 2011). Others have focused on context of reception\nand cultural impacts, comparing the children of immigrants of different national\norigins; these studies have found large differences in the educational outcomes of\nAsian and Hispanic immigrants, for instance, or between the children of immigrants\nwith more positive versus more negative contexts of reception (Haller et al. 2011;\nKasinitz et al. 2008; Waters et al. 2010). Finally, many authors have sought to find the\nspecific mechanisms underlying variation in educational outcomes among the children\nof immigrants, employing national origins merely as controls and focusing instead on\ngender (Feliciano 2012), neighborhood context (Xie and Greenman 2011), or attitudes\nand peer school context (Greenman 2013). The majority of these authors have argued\nthat the nativity, immigrant origin, or mechanism coefficients they observed in rela-\ntionship to educational outcomes are \"net of\" or \"controlling for\" parental background,\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\nwhich is measured as parental education, income, and/or occupational status. Yet, with\nthe exception of Thomas (2009), all these studies employed additive models of parental\neducation or socioeconomic background, assuming uniform effects across different\ngroups or allowing effects to differ only between very broad panethnic groups (Xie and\nIn individual-level studies of second-generation educational attainment, parental\neducational attainment serves as an indicator, or a \"plug-in\" proxy variable (see\ndiscussion in Wooldridge 2003:296) for the unmeasured set of parental characteristics\nthat the researcher deems relevant for educational attainment. Most of these studies\nimplicitly relied on a model of second-generation educational attainment y that recog-\nnizes the effect of a set of parental characteristics x2\n* on educational outcomes of\nchildren, alongside other variables of interest such as parental origin or ethnicity,\ndenoted with x1\nin Eq.

As noted earlier, there are ample reasons to\nbelieve that for some national origin groups, 2\nmay approach 0 simply because school\nquality is so poor or because educational opportunities are extremely rare or are\nallocated with little regard to merit. By definition, we are not able to demonstrate this\npotential problem empirically because x2\n* is unobserved.\nSecond, for Eq. (3) to provide consistent estimators of 1\n, we must also make two\nassumptions about  and v2\n: (1) that error  is uncorrelated with x1\n, the standard\nassumption for any regression model; and (2) that the error v2\nis uncorrelated with x1\n. In other words, we assume that when x2\nis controlled for, the expected value of\n* does not depend on x1\n:\nE x*\nj\n\u00bc E x*\nj\nAgain, following from our earlier review, because there are clear reasons to suspect\nthat the strength of the link between x2\nwill vary across immigrant groups, v2\nwill\nbe correlated with independent variables x1\n, such as parental country of origin. Failing\nto control for potential differences in the educational status transmission process may\ntherefore lead to biased estimates of other relationships of interest to migration scholars\nbesides educational transmission.\nAlthough \"true\" human capital is unobservable, we can empirically demonstrate\nhow failing to account for variation in the strength of educational transmission leads to\nbiased estimates of the differences in the educational attainments of different national\norigin groups.\nSimilar to the model underlying Fig. 1, we regress years of education on the highest\nparental education, here focusing on the children of Mexican immigrants and of native\nnon-Hispanic whites. In Fig. 2, we present the predicted years of education from two\nspecifications: a model that assumes a homogeneous relationship between parental\neducation and second-generation attainment (dashed lines) and a model allowing the\nstrength of intergenerational transmission to differ across groups.3\nWe see that the predicted years of respondent education, particularly at the highest\nand lowest levels of parental education, differ between the additive and interactive\n3 This model is unweighted. The difference in expected education will differ depending on weights used;\nbecause the children of native whites are a much larger percentage of the U.S. population than the children of\nany foreign-born group, in weighted models that also assume homogeneous educational transmission will\nmore closely approximate the native white transmission pattern and will deviate more severely from most\nimmigrant origin patterns.\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\nmodels. For the children of native whites with only eight years of education, for\ninstance, the difference in expected years of education is an entire year. At the other\nend of the spectrum, at 16 years of parental education, the difference in expected\neducation for native-born whites is 0.14 years, and assuming homogenous slopes\noverestimates the attainment of the children of Mexican immigrants by one-fourth of\na year. Rather than \"holding all else equal,\" we get comparisons that are not appropri-\nately matched, and failing to account for different levels of educational transmission\nmakes groups appear more or less disadvantaged than they likely are. In some cases,\nincluding more socioeconomic, behavioral, and attitudinal controls might reduce this\nbias. Still, many of these variables will, to some degree, suffer from the same problems\nas educational attainment.\nAnalysis\nWe now turn to four data sets collected over the last decade that provide information on\nthe educational attainment of second-generation adults and their parents from a variety\nParents' Education (years)\nEducation (years)\nMexican\nNH white\nHomogenous slopes\nModel with interaction\nFig. 2 Example of bias when using aggregate data to estimate inheritance of education from immigrants to\nthe second generation using the IIMMLA data.

Three of these surveys\nsampled second-generation respondents in four different metropolitan areas in the\nUnited States: the Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan\nLos Angeles (IIMMLA) survey; the Immigrant Second Generation in\nMetropolitan New York survey (ISGMNY); and the Children of Immigrants\nLongitudinal Survey (CILS), which surveyed the children of immigrants in San\nDiego and Miami. In addition, we rely on the National Education Longitudinal\nStudy (NELS), which provides nationally representative samples of several na-\ntional origin groups.\nData\nSecond-Generation Surveys: IIMMLA, ISGMNY, and CILS\nThese three surveys, collected specifically for the study of the children of post-1965\nimmigrants, all provide extensive information on respondents' educational trajectory as\nwell as the educational background of their parents. Although these surveys have the\ndisadvantage of not being nationally representative, they employ quota sampling and\nthus provide sufficient samples for national origin groups that a nationally representa-\ntive sample could not capture.\nThe survey targeted second-generation Chinese, Dominicans, Russian Jews, West\nIndians, and Central Americans from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It also includes\ncomparison groups of native blacks, Puerto Ricans, and non-Hispanic whites.\n& Also a telephone survey, IIMMLA was conducted in 2004 and collected approxi-\nmetropolitan area, comprising Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside, and San\nBernardino counties. The sample has quotas for second- and 1.5-generation groups\n(Mexicans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, Koreans, Chinese, and Central Americans from\nGuatemala and El Salvador) and includes three native-parentage comparison groups\ncomposed of third- and later-generation Mexican-Americans, non-Hispanic whites,\nand blacks.\n& CILS involved a longitudinal survey of immigrant offspring living in San\nDiego (California) and Miami/Ft. Lauderdale (Florida). The original survey\nwas conducted in 1992, with samples of second-generation children attend-\ning the eighth and ninth grades in public and private schools in the\nmetropolitan areas of Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and San Diego. The students\nare interested in the final educational attainment, we use Wave 3 of the\ndata, which provides 3,334 respondents. In Wave 2, CILS also asked about\nparental education and directly interviewed the parents of approximately\none-half of the original respondents. We use this additional information in\nsupplementary analyses to assess the impact of error in children's reports of\nparental education on our estimates.\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\nNational Education Longitudinal Study (NELS)\nEducation Statistics (NCES) initiated a nationally representative longitudinal\nstudy of 8th grade students attending 1,052 high schools across the United\nStates. We restrict our analysis to the fourth wave collected in 2000, which\nTo make our work comparable to previous research and to reduce issues of censor-\ning, we use only respondents of an age when most will have finished their educational\ncareers. For IIMMLA, ISGMNY and NELS, we restrict our samples to respondents\nages 25 and older. Because the CILS surveyed a younger population, we have to use a\nlower cutoff and have a sample between ages 23 and 25. We further control for age at\ntime of survey. We define the second generation as children who have at least one\nforeign-born parent and who were born in the United States or arrived before starting\nprimary school (less than 5 years old).4\nVariables\nNational Origin\nFor IIMMLA, CILS, and the ISGMNY, we code national origin as respondent's place\nof birth. When the respondent was born in the United States, we use mother's place of\nbirth; where this is missing or in the United States, we use father's birthplace. NELS\ndoes not provide detailed information on parent's place of birth. For this survey, we use\nrespondent's reported ethnic origin. We include groups with at least 30 valid observa-\ntions in the analysis.\nRespondent's Years of Education\nThe data available on respondents years of education differ across the surveys:\nIIMMLA data contain greater detail on grade level and time spent in college,\nand provide a variable that maps this information into years of education\n(ranging from 6 to 20 years). ISGMNY contains less detail about early school-\ning; we code the lowest educational category (some grade school) at 6 years of\neducation. CILS data were collected in schools during early adolescence and\nthus are left-censored at 10 years of schooling; the cutoff for NELS data is 9\nyears. All data have 20 years of education as the highest category.\nParental Years of Education\nFor ISGMNY and IIMMLA, we coded parental education using the same coding\nroutine as described earlier for the respondents. The IIMMLA included a small number\nof parents with no formal schooling, which we coded as 0 years of education. CILS\nprovides only categorical measures of educational attainment for respondent's parents,\n4 Our results are robust to using a more restrictive definition that includes only U.S.-born children of two\nforeign-born parents.\nR.R. Luthra, T. Soehl\nwith the lowest level at elementary school or less (coded as 6 years of education)\nand the highest level at college graduate or more (coded 16). Similarly, NELS\nprovides categorical measures of parental education that begin at \"did not finish\nhigh school\" (coded 10). The highest level of education, \"Ph.D., M.D. etc.,\" is\ncoded as 20 years of education.\nWe code the number of years of formal education both the respondent's mother and\nthe father received and then define parental education as the highest of the two. Our\nresults are substantively robust to using either father's or mother's education as the\nindependent variable.\nResults\nWe first summarize and describe the distributions of parental and respondent's educa-\ntion data for each national origin group sampled. We present means and variances. We\nthen calculate changes in these parameters between parents and children as well as the\nregression coefficient of respondents on parents' education. This information is sum-\nmarized in Table 1.\nWe see that for the majority of the immigrant groups, the children have a\nhigher average education than their parents and that their distributions are far\nmore compressed. Thus, not only do the children of immigrants have higher\neducational attainment than their parents, but there is also less within-group\ninequality in the second generation.\nThe last two columns of Table 1 show the estimated slope coefficients and\nstandard errors from a linear regression of respondents' education on parental\neducation measured in years, controlling for age. The slopes vary significantly\nacross groups, ranging from being statistically not different from 0 to a\nmaximum of 0.41. Thus, a key assumption of both aggregate regression and\nhuman capital controls--that the relationship between parental and respondent\neducation is equal across groups--is not satisfied. More specifically, we see\nthat among immigrant groups, with the exception of Filipinos, Colombians,\nand Indians, the effect of parental education is substantially smaller than for\nwhites with native parents where the regression coefficient ranges from 0.28\n(NELS) to 0.31 (IIMMLA) to as high as 0.41 in the ISGMNY data--coeffi-\ncients of the same magnitude as the ones quoted by Card and colleagues\nsimilar: 0.28 in the ISGMNY data but a bit lower in the NELS and IIMM\nLA data. Only among the children of native-born Puerto Ricans in our New\nYork (ISGMNY) data is parental influence as low as that observed among the\nchildren of immigrants. This may be a consequence of the particular sample of\nPuerto Ricans in the ISGMNY, who are more likely to live in the same ethnic\nenclaves as the foreign-born and thus are subject to similar transmission\nprocesses as immigrants.\nIn contrast, for native-born (third- and later-generation) families with Mexican\nancestry in the Los Angeles area, the effect of parental education on respondent's\neducation is 0.39, significantly higher than the coefficients observed amongst the\nsecond-generation groups. Given that third- and later-generation Mexican-origin fam-\nilies are more likely to disperse into majority Anglo neighborhoods than Puerto Ricans\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\nTable 1 Educational attainment as measured in years of respondents, their parents, and intergenerational change by national origin group and survey source in analysis\nParents Respondents Change Across Generations Regression\nMean Var.

We average our measures\nof education and age by origin group and then use these aggregate data to regress\nrespondent's education on parental education. The slope coefficient of this regression is\n0.35, and after we weight each national origin group to represent their proportion of the\nU.S. foreign-born population as of 2000 (Model 1b), we obtain a regression coefficient\nof 0.43. These are coefficients of the same magnitude as the one found by Card et al.\nhigher than almost all the estimates of intergenerational transmission within groups in\nModel 2 uses the individual-level data for all immigrant groups from all four\nsurveys, weighted for their representation among the foreign-born, thus giving an\naverage of the effect of parental education in immigrant families. This model also\nincludes dummy variables for each national origin to net out differences in average\neducation levels of groups. The slope estimate for the effect of the transmission of\nparental educational attainment is 0.11, which is significantly lower than the 0.3 to 0.4\nestimated for nonmigrant families.\nModel 3 again uses pooled individual-level data for all immigrant groups from all\nsurveys, weighted for their representation among the foreign-born, but does not include\nfixed effects for national origin. Even in this specification, the transmission rate remains\nFinally, in Model 4, we replicate Borjas (1992) and estimate a random-\neffects generalized least squares model including individual information on\nparental education as well as the mean parental education of each group--in\neffect, estimating Eq. (1) from earlier and disaggregating the individual- and\ngroup-level effects. As expected, the effect of average education in the group\nis not 0 (or negligible) as would be required for reliable inference with\ngroup-level data, but in fact is larger than the effect of parental attainment by a\nfactor of about 2. Taken together, these two coefficients add up to the\naggregate-data estimate obtained in Model 1.\nVariation in Intergenerational Transmission of Education\nAlthough immigrants in general have much lower rates of intergenerational transmis-\nsion than natives, there is considerable variation in the strength of intergenerational\ntransmission by national origins. To examine this variation, Fig. 3 plots the regression\ncoefficients in Table 1 against the mean parental education and the dispersion\nof parental education in each group. Mean parental education and the dispersion of\nparental education of the origin group in the United States serve here as indicators\nof the coethnic community and sending country allocation of education, which are two\n5 Replicating regressions using the mean level of education of adults from the same origin group at the\nmetropolitan level from the census gives similar results: .31 unweighted and .51 weighted.\nR.R.

In contrast, higher\nwithin-group variation in education is associated with weaker parent\u00adchild association.\nThese associations point to a number of mechanisms. First, for immigrants from countries\nwith poor quality (as indicated by low mean) and unequal (as indicated by larger standard\ndeviation) education systems, parental education will be a relatively worse indicator of the\nfamily characteristics that matter for the educational attainment of the second generation.\nSecond, members of national origin groups with higher average education will rely\nless on community-level resources (ethnic capital) and are less likely to live in distinct\nneighborhoods where national origin overlaps with peer characteristics and the avail-\nability of extrafamilial educational support systems. In addition, any ethnic social\ncapital will be most effective when human capital differs significantly within the group:\nfor instance, in the case of the Chinese in New York (Kasinitz et al. 2008) or the\nVietnamese in New Orleans (Zhou and Bankston 1994).\nMeasurement Error and Other Caveats\nOne possible objection to this analysis may be the issue of measurement error. As\nBorjas (1992) discussed, measurement error in parental education (because of recall\nerror, for example) may increase the estimate of the effect of mean education of the\n. Acting as an instrument, mean parental education may capture some of the\n\"lost\" individual-level effects.\nUsing a subset of our data, we directly address this issue. CILS asked second-\ngeneration respondents in Waves 1 and 2 about parental education and included a\nparental questionnaire for a subset of the sample. Although highly correlated (.77),\nresponses are not perfectly consistent. To assess the extent to which this measurement\nerror may attenuate the coefficients for intergenerational transmission and inflate\n\"group effects,\" we use all three measures of parental education as indicators of\na latent variable that enters the regression equation for educational outcomes along\nwith a vector of the origin group means. Thus, we take the \"true\" educational\nattainment of a parent as a latent variable i\nmeasured by a vector of observed indicators\nxi\n. In our case, xi\nhas length 3, combining the respondents' answers about their parents'\neducation in Wave 1 and Wave 2 as well as the parental questionnaire where available.\nFactor loadings  and intercepts  relate these indicators to our unmeasured variable\nparental education, leaving residuals i\n. This measurement model can be written as\nxi\n\u00bc  \u00fe \ni\n\u00fe i\nIn conjunction with Eq. (1), this gives us a regression coefficient for family-level\ntransmission of education that is not attenuated by measurement error.\nTable 3 summarizes the results. For comparison, we include regression models\nanalog to those in Model 4 from Table 2. Using measures of fathers' education, we\nsee that the latent variable estimate of parental transmission is indeed somewhat higher\ncompared with the regression estimates, and the effect of national origin education is a\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\nbit lower. In the case of mothers' education, we see a similar pattern in the estimate of\nthe parental transmission, but the \"group effect\" does not reach statistical significance\nin either the regression or the latent variable models. We conclude that measurement\nerror does introduce some upward bias on the estimated effect of characteristics of the\nnational origin groups and some downward bias on the estimate of family-level\ntransmission. However, the magnitude of this bias is not large enough to substantively\nalter the conclusions of our analysis.\nFinally, we want to briefly address three other caveats. First, the majority of our data\ncome from metropolitan areas with large numbers of immigrants residing in ethnic\nneighborhoods. Our article therefore best represents the experiences of immigrants and\ntheir children in traditional gateway cities. However, traditional metropolitan destina-\ntions still reflect the experience of the majority of the immigrants in the United States:\nTo further assess whether a national-level sample would differ, we replicated all the\nearlier analyses using only the NELS national-level data, applying survey weights for\nnational representativeness. The substantive finding remained the same: the effect of\naverage group education level (0.33, for 10 groups) was much larger than the effect of\nindividual-level parental education (0.19).\nSecond, there is some discrepancy in the characteristics of immigrant national origin\ngroups across surveys. For instance, estimates of intergenerational transmission among\nMexicans in the IIMMLA and NELS survey are higher and are statistically significant,\nwhereas estimates from CILS data are lower and not statistically significant at conven-\ntional levels. Many differences between each survey could account for these differ-\nences, including the sampling at different ages (youth in NELS and CILS, and adults in\nIIMMLA and ISGMNY) as well as differences between metropolitan areas and\nnational averages. Ultimately, we cannot pin down the cause for these differences,\nand we take comfort in the estimates being substantively consistent: for instance,\nFilipinos consistently have the highest levels of intergenerational transmission, whereas\nmost of the groups show estimates that are below 0.2.\nTable 3 Models using various different measurements of parental education available in the CILS data\nRegression\nLatent Variable Model\nUsing Wave 1 Using Wave 2\nCoef. z Coef. z Coef. z\nNotes: The regression models are estimated analog to Model 3 in Table 3.

Soehl\nFinally, with the expansion of higher education systems in various migrant-sending\ncountries in recent decades, we might expect that the intergenerational transmission of\neducation among children of immigrants from countries with lower average educational\nattainment to be stronger among more recent cohorts of immigrants. Documenting such\nchanges may be a fruitful avenue for further research.\nDiscussion\nThis article demonstrates that intergenerational transmission of education is weaker\nwithin immigrant families than in native families and that the strength of the transmis-\nsion differs between immigrants of different national origins. The existence of signif-\nicant group-level effects on the educational transmission process violates the uniformity\nassumption underpinning the use of both aggregate data and parental background\n\"controls\" in studies of immigrant intergenerational change.\nEstimates based on aggregate data subsume both group-level effects as well as\nindividual-level transmission processes. Yet, contemporary theories of assimilation\nhighlight the analytical distinction between individual-level (or family-level) processes\non the one hand and national origin differences in ethnic resources and immigrant\ncontexts of reception (\"group-level effects\") on the other. Thus the \"cross-level infer-\nence problem\" relates to the conceptual distinction between individuals and ethnic\ncategories in social science analysis. As the broader literature on race, ethnicity, and\nnationalism shows, ethnicity and group-level processes certainly play a role in life\nchances, but ethnic groups are not the building blocks of society and cannot be the units\nof coherent social science analysis (Brubaker 2004).\nOur analysis suggests that the relationship between formal education and the\nsocioeconomic and human capital traits that encourage children's academic\nattainment varies across immigrant groups and, quite systematically, between\nimmigrants and natives. Immigrants and natives are educated in fundamentally\ndifferent education systems and therefore--from the point of view of education\nas a selection mechanism or a sorting by abilities--have educations that are not\ncommensurate. Thus \"controlling for education\" (or for parental education) may\nbe a statistical exercise of dubious value in analyses that compare immigrants\nof different origins or immigrants and the U.S.-born.\nOur article has two concrete implications. First, individual-level data are necessary\nfor the measurement of intergenerational continuity in socioeconomic characteristics in\nimmigrant families and especially for comparisons across time and between different\nimmigrant origin groups and the native-born. Second, our article cautions against the\ncommon practice to \"control for education\" in analyses that contain immigrant and\nnatives as a way of taking human capital into account or to control for parental\neducation in analyses of the second generation and natives as a way of controlling\nfor the human capital of parents. Fortunately, the most recent data on U.S. immigrant\nfamilies (such as those used in this article) now enable researchers to include additional\ncontrols for the aptitudes, values, and resources hypothesized to drive the different\ntransmission rates across ethnic groups. Beyond the United States, a promising new\nline of research posits using measures of \"relative educational attainments,\" or the\neducational position of the immigrant in the distribution of the country of origin (Ichou\nEducational Attainment in Immigrant Families\n2014), as a more universal control for parental background when making adjusted\ncomparisons of second-generation outcomes.\nThis study also establishes that national origin average educational level and dispersion\nmoderate the intergenerational transmission process. We show that the strength of the\ncorrelation between immigrant parent and child is positively related to the average level of\neducation and inversely related to the educational variance of the immigrant origin group.\nWe interpret this finding as evidence that among the more highly educated and educationally\nhomogeneous immigrant origin groups, who are less likely to live in ethnic enclaves and rely\non ethnic resources, extrafamilial influences will play a smaller role.\nIndeed, this interpretation aligns with what we know about immigrants with the\nlargest intergenerational coefficients: those of Indian and Filipino origin. Both migra-\ntion streams are dominated by middle-class professionals, educated in formerly\ncolonialized English language schooling systems, the former displaying strong cultural\nand linguistic ties with the United Kingdom and the United States and the latter the\nlargest former U.S.-colonized immigrant group in the United States (Cheng and Yang\nlinguistic acculturation, and formal legal status. Their rapid socioeconomic absorption\ninto the \"middle-class mainstream\" creates patterns of intergenerational transmission\nsimilar to that of native whites. On the other hand, the Vietnamese, Korean, and\nChinese origin groups with very low intergenerational transmission rates reside in\nstrong ethnic enclaves that promote high rates of upward intergenerational mobility\namong even the most disadvantaged members.\nOn average, and especially in migrant streams with low levels of education, parental\neducation is much less predictive of the educational outcomes of the second generation\nthan estimates based on aggregate data suggest. On the one hand, this bodes well for the\nlong-term impacts of low-educated immigration streams on inequality in the United\nStates. On the other hand, a variety of extrafamilial influences still create ethnically\nstratified outcomes in second-generation educational attainment. Current research that\nfocuses on the sources of group-level heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility\n(Luthra and Waldinger 2013), as well as within-group variation in the relative strength\nof family- versus group-level effects (Alba et al. 2014), should enable the further\ndevelopment of theory in this area.\n"
